Often, they are asymptomatic and the diagnosis is accidental. The case we present is the incidental finding of a fistula displayed with echocardiography during acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A 73-year-old man presented in the emergency room for non-ST-elevation ACS. Echocardiogram showed in a parasternal short axis view an abnormal diastolic flow inside the ventricular inferior wall. Angiography and CT confirmed the diagnosis of coronary fistula from the right coronary into the left ventricular cavity. A literature analysis with discussion about coronary fistulas classification and management was also performed.Coronary artery fistulas are rare abnormal connections between a coronary artery and a cardiac chamber or a major vessel. They are often asymptomatic and the diagnosis is accidental. The case we present is the accidental finding of a fistula displayed with echocardiography during acute coronary syndrome (ACS).A 73-year-old man, with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia, presented in the emergency room because of sudden onset of chest pain at rest. ECG abnormalities associated with an increase of cardiac enzymes (hs troponin 70 pg/ml and CK-MB 8 ng/ml) were suggestive of an ACS (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit. Echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy (septum 14 mm), end-diastolic diameter (53 mm), and mild hypokinesia of the basal segment of the inferior wall with normal systolic function (EF 55%). In the parasternal short axis view, we noticed an abnormal diastolic flow inside the ventricular inferior wall. This flow was directed from the basal segment of the inferior wall into the left ventricular cavity. In the apical two-chamber view, we could follow its entire intramural course, from the apex to the basal portion of the left ventricle, under the mitral valve posterior leaflet, where it was thrown into the ventricular cavity during diastole. Pulsed Doppler sample volume positioned at the level of the flow into the left ventricle confirmed that it was a diastolic flow (Figure 1). The echocardiographic data were suggestive for coronary fistula.According to ESC guidelines, the GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) risk score of the patient was 146 and early invasive strategy of myocardial revascularization (within the first 24 hours from admission) was indicated. The patient underwent coronary angiography, which revealed 90% stenosis in the middle portion and 70% stenosis in the distal portion of the left anterior descending artery, a double 70% stenosis in the proximal and the middle portion of the circumflex artery and the right coronary artery, dominant, with stenosis of 50% at the end of the proximal portion. Angiography confirmed the presence of a tortuous voluminous coronary fistula: it originated from the interventricular posterior artery and coursed along the posterior interventricular sulcus from the apex to the base of the left ventricle. The terminal portion of the fistula (approximately two-millimeter vessel diameter) crossed the inferoposterior wall of the left ventricle under the mitral annulus, and with a phasic flow, typically diastolic, it went into the ventricular cavity (Figure 2). The patient underwent percutaneous coronary angioplasty with the placement of two drug-eluting stents in the left anterior descending artery ( in the distal tract and  in the middle tract) and a single drug-eluting stent () in the circumflex artery.To complete evaluation, cardiac CT was performed to detect coronary fistula anatomy, its relationships with cardiac structures and its course. CT images documented that coronary fistula originated from the distal portion of the right coronary artery, ran into the left ventricular inferior wall, and drained into the left ventricular chamber under the mitral valve, with a final tract with an intramyocardial course (Figure 3). Because the coronary artery fistula did not determine a hemodynamic overload, it was not treated by angioplasty or surgery. At 24-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic.Coronary fistulas are defined as an abnormal communication between a coronary artery and a cardiac chamber (“coronary-room fistula”), bypassing the capillary bed or any part of the systemic or pulmonary circulation. The first description was by Krause in 1865 and the first surgical treatment was reported by Bjork and Crafoord in 1947 [1]. Fistulas are rare anomalies. They are present in 0.002% of the general population, and they are found in 0.25% of patients undergoing coronary angiography [2]. In an autoptic series of 18950 autopsies, Alexander and Griffith found 54 coronary anomalies (0.3%) [3]. They are often asymptomatic, so their diagnosis is often incidental. Epidemiological data and their incidence may be underestimated in literature. Coronary fistulas may be congenital or acquired. Most of the fistulas are congenital, and their embryological origin appears to be due to the persistence of sinusoidal connections between the lumens of the primitive tubular heart. The acquired forms may be further divided into iatrogenic (during percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiac surgery, myocardial biopsy, and septal myectomy), traumatic, or related to a disease (such as myocardial infarction, Takayasu arteritis, and cardiomyopathies) [4, 5]. Several classifications have been proposed. The first one was by Ogden in 1970, placing coronary fistulas between major coronary anomalies [2]. In 1999, Angelini proposed a new classification of congenital coronary anomalies, identifying anomalies of origin and course, intrinsic coronary anomalies (myocardial bridging, ) and termination anomalies. According to this scheme, fistulas are anomalies of termination [4].Fistulas are also classified, according to the scheme of Sakakibara et al., into two types: type A, which presents proximal vessel dilation from which originates the fistula, and type B, with the expansion of the entire vessel [6]. Most originates from the right coronary artery and the left anterior descending, less frequently from the circumflex artery. The origin of fistula is rarely bilateral, involving both right and left coronary arteries. In more than 90% of cases, fistulas drain to venous system (in order of frequency: right ventricle, right atrium, pulmonary artery, and coronary sinus), rarely in the left chambers [7] or in the pericardium [8]. Said described the fistulas according to the number of vessels (single channel or multiple channels) and their course (linear or serpentine). Single fistulas are much more frequent than multiple ones [9].From the pathophysiological point of view, the main problem is shunt entity. It is determined by the size of the fistula and the pressure difference between the coronary artery and the chamber into which the fistula drains. The fistulas that drain into the right-sided chambers (low resistance system) may cause volume overload with hemodynamic impairment, while drainage into the left chambers (high resistance system) leads to a lower overload but may cause an arterial runoff with dilatation of native vessel. In general, small fistulas do not cause symptoms. Larger fistulas can lead to the “steal phenomenon,” which is the reduction of myocardial blood flow distal to the site of the fistula, resulting in myocardial ischemia, more evident in combination with increased demand of oxygen, such as during exercise [10].Natural history is variable: some close spontaneously, while others persist. It may happen that the coronary artery which originates fistula gradually dilated up to frank aneurysm, while the fistula may be complicated by ulceration of the intima, degeneration of the media, atherosclerotic plaques, calcification, mural thrombus, and rarely rupture [1]. The clinical manifestations increase with age. The most frequent symptoms are dyspnea on exertion, angina, fatigue, palpitations, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The gold standard for the detection of coronary fistulas remains coronary angiography. Other imaging techniques such as MRI and CT may provide additional diagnostic elements thanks to 3D reconstructions. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography is useful especially in the evaluation of the hemodynamic effects of the fistula on cardiac chambers [11].The closure of the fistula is recommended when it is symptomatic, while the treatment in asymptomatic patients remains controversial. Large coronary fistulas should be closed by transcatheter or surgical treatment, regardless of symptoms, while small to moderate size fistulas should be treated only if they cause symptoms [12]. The surgical approach is ligation of epicardial fistula, less frequently intraluminal endarterectomy. Transcatheter closure may be performed with various types of devices (stents, umbrellas, balloons, coils, etc.) but requires favorable anatomy, i.e., not tortuous artery with single fistula and accessibility of the distal portion to closure device [12].The peculiarity of our case, compared to others reported in the literature [13], is the echocardiographic diagnosis during an acute coronary syndrome. The suspicion of coronary fistula draining in the left ventricle was given by the finding of an abnormal color flow in the ventricular cavity and its route in the wall. Our deductions were then confirmed by coronary angiography and CT. As reported in the literature, fistulas draining into the left ventricle are extremely rare [7]. Echocardiography can give a suspicious diagnosis when there is a hemodynamic impairment, but in our case, it happened during a routine examination by the detection of an abnormal coronary flow in the myocardial wall. The patient’s angina was not determined by the fistula but by the presence of atherosclerotic plaques on the left anterior descending and circumflex artery. In fact, the fistula drained into the left ventricle without making any hemodynamic impairment. Therefore, no indication was given for its closure.Coronary artery fistulas are described as a direct connection between a coronary artery and one of the cardiac chambers, large vessels, or other vascular structures. They are usually congenital or acquired in rare cases. Most of them are asymptomatic; in fact, small fistulas do not cause any hemodynamic impairment. Some patients, typically with larger fistulas, present symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, angina, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or infective endocarditis. Often, signs of ventricular overload may be observed by echocardiography. Sometimes, an abnormal flow is observed in the drainage chamber. More rarely, the course in the ventricular wall may be followed with the echocardiogram. The peculiarity of this case is the echocardiographic description of a fistula draining into the left ventricle. In fact, the echocardiographic visualization of a fistula is a rare event. Our patient showed no signs of left ventricular overload, so the fistula was an occasional finding that occurred during ACS. Its closure was not indicated because it did not cause any hemodynamic overload or any symptom, so conservative treatment was preferred.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.The supplementary material is only one figure, which could be described as “Admission EKG.” (Supplementary Materials)
Left Ventricular Noncompaction: A Rare Case of Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy
1Department of Medicine, Northwell Health at Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, NY 10305, USA2Department of Electrophysiology, Northwell Health at Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, NY 10305, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Asif Uddin; moc.liamg@niddu1fisaReceived 6 March 2019; Accepted 4 July 2019; Published 8 August 2019Academic Editor: Magnus BaumhäkelCopyright © 2019 Julia Tian et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Isolated left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare form of cardiomyopathy that is characterized by deep intertrabecular recesses and abnormal trabeculations that can be observed on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or cardiac MRI (CMR) studies. Our case describes a 41-year-old male who presented with exertional chest pain and was discovered to have significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) which was nonischemic in etiology as confirmed by cardiac catheterization. Subsequent evaluation with CMR imaging revealed noncompaction of the left ventricle. The patient received defibrillation and lifelong anticoagulation given his elevated risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). This case highlights the importance of considering unconventional etiologies of cardiomyopathy when investigating new-onset heart failure as well as the necessity of life-saving measures such as anticoagulation and defibrillator implantation in view of arrhythmogenic structural heart diseases.Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is an uncommon cardiomyopathy estimated to occur between 0.014 and 1.3 percent in the general population. It is characterized by deep intertrabecular recesses and abnormal trabeculations popularly believed to result from a failure of a phase of cardiac development during which the normal myocardium compacts inward. However, it can also involve abnormalities during ventricular wall formation or remodeling which can be transient or permanent [1, 2].Clinical manifestations vary widely and can range from asymptomatic disease to symptoms of heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, thromboembolism, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, bundle branch blocks, and sudden cardiac death. The most common manifestations are heart failure and ventricular systolic dysfunction.There is currently no universally-accepted criteria for classifying and diagnosing LVNC. Depending on the organization, it may be classified as a genetic cardiomyopathy or as an unclassified cardiomyopathy [3, 4]. Diagnosis of LVNC can be made using imaging studies such as echocardiography, computed tomography, or CMR. Similar to the clinical criteria, no standard imaging criteria currently exist. The Jenni, Chin, and Stollberger criteria emphasize different components of the echocardiogram [5, 6]. A summary of all three would involve evidence of a two-layered structure (thin compacted epicardial layer and thick endocardial layer) with a noncompacted to compacted ratio of greater than 2 (greater than 2.3 on CMR), an epicardial-to-trabeculation trough to epicardial-to-trabeculation peak ratio of less than 0.5, and more than three trabeculations from the ventricular wall (not sensitive for CMR) [7, 8].The patient was a 41-year-old male with a past medical history of unspecified congenital heart disease, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism (taking intramuscular testosterone injections twice weekly), who presented with a chief complaint of chest pain during exertion of 1-month duration. The pain was described as 10 out of 10 in intensity, burning with a band-like tightness in nature, and located in the epigastric area with radiation toward the substernal region. His initial cardiac enzymes were significant for a troponin level of 0.62 ng/mL. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was 1,190. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a sinus rhythm with right superior axis deviation, biatrial enlargement, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Further evaluation with a TTE revealed that the patient had a LVEF of 20-29% with a markedly dilated left atrium and left ventricle. Subsequently, a cardiac catheterization did not reveal evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Given the trivial history of congenital heart disease and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, a cardiac MRI was then conducted and revealed a noncompacted to compacted myocardium ratio of greater than 2.3 in the left ventricle, global hypokinesis with severely depressed left and right ventricle ejection fractions of 27% and 26%, biatrial enlargement, and no evidence of a left ventricular thrombus (Figures 1 and 2). His hospital course was complicated by an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which given his LVNC and low ejection fraction, placed him at an elevated risk for SCD. The patient subsequently received an internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD) and was discharged home with aspirin, beta blocker, angiotensin-receptor blocker, and anticoagulation therapy with warfarin.In summary, LVNC is an uncommon and controversial cause of cardiomyopathy. It is becoming a popular topic in the field of cardiology due to its multiple possible etiologies, pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, and clinical course. Due to its highly variable manifestations, the management of this condition should be individualized. Patients with evidence of heart failure should receive guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). Some literature supports the use of anticoagulation in patients with LVEF less than 40%, a history of atrial fibrillation, or a prior cardioembolic event [9]. All patients should also receive family and genetic counseling. As an uncommon disease with a multitude of life-threatening complications, it is imperative to perform a thorough cardiac evaluation in cases of new-onset heart failure with or without arrhythmia. In addition, further research and collaboration from major organizations are necessary to create a standardized criteria for the diagnosis and management of this disorder.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava and Absent Right Superior Vena Cava with Left Subclavian Vein Stenosis: Technical Challenges with Pacemaker Implantation
McLaren Greater Lansing Hospital, Lansing, MI, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Khalil Kanjwal; moc.oohay@lawjnaklilahkReceived 12 January 2019; Accepted 16 July 2019; Published 29 July 2019Academic Editor: Kathleen NguCopyright © 2019 Khalil Kanjwal et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We present a challenging case of a 75-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and symptomatic sick sinus syndrome (SSS) who presented for a dual chamber pacemaker implantation and was found to have persistent left superior vena cava and absent right superior vena cava with stenosis of the left subclavian vein. In this report, we discuss the implant technique in this group of patients.Persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) along with absent right SVC is a rare occurrence. It has been reported in 0.1% of the general population [1–3]. There have been only less than 15 cases reported in the literature. Pacemaker implantation can be very challenging in such patients, and there has not been much reported on various techniques of implanting pacemaker in such patients. To our knowledge, this is a second report of pacemaker implantation in a patient with persistent left SVC and absent right SVC. In addition, our patient also had left subclavian vein stenosis and thus complicating the implant procedure further.A 75-year-old female with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), statuspost atrial fibrillation ablation, and prior history of breast cancer, statuspost bilateral mastectomy and left lymphadenectomy, presented with diziness and near syncope and was found to have sinus bradycardia. Given her symptomatic sick sinus syndrome (SSS), she was planned for a dual chamber pacemaker implantation.The placement of a dual chamber pacemaker insertion was attempted from the right side as the patient previously underwent left-sided lymphadenectomy. The right subclavian vein access was obtained and cannulated under fluoroscopy. The right ventricular (RV) lead was advanced attempting to access the right superior vena cava (SVC). While attempting to advance the lead, resistance was encountered and the lead was withdrawn. A venogram was performed revealing the absence of a right SVC with the presence of a persistent left superior vena cava draining into a massively dilated coronary sinus (Figures 1 and 2).The lead could not be advanced into the right ventricle, and as a result, the procedure was aborted and cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for possible epicardial lead placement.After discussing the potential need for cardiothoracic surgery with the patient, she considered another attempt at transvenous placement of a dual chamber pacemaker with us. After repeated attempts, left subclavian vein access could not be obtained. The venogram revealed stenosis of the left subclavian vein. The decision was made to make an additional attempt from the right subclavian vein utilizing the previous pocket. After successful cannulation of the right subclavian vein, an active fixation lead was advanced through the subclavian vein into the PLSVC through the coronary sinus and then through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricular septum. Following successful right ventricular lead placement, an active fixation bipolar pacing lead was advanced into the right atrium using a straight stylet and secured to the right atrial wall.Stimulation and sensing thresholds were determined to be satisfactory in both leads. A St. Jude Medical generator was connected to the leads, and the pocket was closed.PLSVC is a rare congenital anomaly found in approximately 0.3-0.5% of the general population [1–3], and its occurrence along with absent right-sided SVC is reported in 0.1% of the general population. It results from the failure of the vessel to involute during embryologic development.This anomaly usually exists with the presence of a right superior vena cava (SVC) and is usually found incidentally during cardiac device implantation. In patient with PLSVC, the cardiac devices are implanted from the right subclavian approach as the lead manipulation and deployment can be challenging from the left side. Absent right SVC with PLSVC occurs extremely rarely in less than 0.1% of the general population [1, 2]. In this report, we outline the technical approach to the placement of dual chamber pacemaker leads in a patient with solitary PLSVC. Our case was further complicated by subclavian stenosis on the left side. The right subclavian access was obtained using a micropuncture needle under fluoroscopy. The venography demonstrated the absence of right-sided SVC, and the wire could easily pass over the left SVC. The sheath was advanced over the wire, and a 65 cm active fixation lead could be easily advanced through the right subclavian into the left SVC and the coronary sinus and through the coronary sinus os into the right atrium in the right anterior oblique (RAO) fluoroscopic view. As the lead came out of the coronary sinus, it is directed in a direction opposite to that of the RV inlet, thus making the implantation and manipulation of the RV lead challenging. The most critical part of the procedure is crossing the tricuspid valve, and inability to do that will result in failure of the lead placement. In our patient, when the lead came out of the coronary sinus, it was further advanced without the stylet towards the right atrial wall. The forward movement against the RA free wall formed a loop, and subsequently, the part of the lead was prolapsed into the right ventricle. The stylet with a spiral curve made at the end of the stylet was introduced and advanced, and when it reached the coronary sinus os, the pull and push maneuver on the stylet and the lead was performed. The lead tip crossed the RV inlet and was further advanced into the RV towards RV septum. The septal location was confirmed in the left anterior oblique (LAO) fluoroscopic position, and subsequently, the helix was deployed (Figure 3).There are few technical considerations the implanting physicians need to be aware of while implanting cardiac devices in patients with PLSVC and absent right SVC.The course of the right subclavian to PLSVC is long. A longer sheath may be considered while navigating the lead through anomalous course of the vein. In addition, a longer lead (65 cm) would be a preferred length lead given the long course of right subclavian, PLSVC, and coronary sinus. The prolapse technique with a spiral curve of the stylet should be considered during such implants.Other potential alternatives may be included using a coronary sinus deliver system. A 0.35 wire may be advanced through the subclavian/left SVC venous system through coronary sinus os and through the RV inlet into the right ventricle followed by advancing the delivery system over the wire into the right ventricle.The right atrial lead does not pose a technical challenge in such patients. When it comes out of the CS OS, it is directed towards the right free wall; however, it could be challenging sometimes to direct the lead into the right atrial appendage. A clockwise torque with a J-shaped stylet may help in such situation.To the best of our knowledge, there has been only one report of pacemaker implantation in a patient with persistent left SVC with absent right SVC from the right subclavian vein [4]. The use of a fixed-shaped sheath and a lumen less bipolar pacing lead from Medtronic has been recently reported for implantation of a pacemaker from the left brachiocephalic system through the left persistent SVC [5].Venous anomalies can be encountered during cardiac device implantations. Preprocedure venography may help identify such anomalies, and the physicians can plan on the techniques and need for special equipment ahead of time to have a better patient outcome.Teaching Points. (1) Preimplant venograms provide crucial information about venous anatomy. (2) Implanting physicians should be aware of venous anomalies encountered during device implants. (3) A clear concept of venous anomalies and trouble shooting skills may improve patient outcomes.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
A Rare Case of Sudden Death in a Patient with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Secondary to Cardiac Rupture

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM), also known as broken heart syndrome or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is a rare condition with an estimated incidence of 0.02% of all hospitalizations in United States and 2% of all acute coronary syndrome presentations. TCM predominately presents as a transient wall motion abnormality of the left ventricular apex due to emotional or physical stress. Cardiac rupture in the setting of TCM is an extremely rare phenomenon with limited published case reports. We present a case of a 75-year-old female who had cardiac rupture secondary to TCM and performed a literature review using Ovid MEDLINE for published cases showing this association. After the literature review, we found 20 cases showing this association, which are listed in a tabular fashion.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM), also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, was first described in Japan in 1990 [1]. It mimics acute coronary syndrome and is characterized by transient systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle, wall motion abnormalities, and elevated cardiac biomarkers and is frequently preceded by emotional or physical stress [2]. Ballooning of the left ventricular apex with a finding of patent coronary arteries is typically present on left ventriculography and cardiac catheterization, respectively. It is diagnosed in 0.02% of all nationwide hospitalization and predominantly involves elderly females [3]. The inpatient mortality rate in patients with TCM is 4.5% [3]. There has been a gradual increase in the incidence of TCM with the realization that this entity is not as benign as it was thought to be. As per recent TCM registry, on long-term follow-up, rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was 9.9% per patient-year and death was 5.6% per patient-year [4]. While TCM is usually reversible, it may present with rare complications including systemic embolism, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac rupture leading to cardiac arrest [5]. We present an exceptional rare case of TCM leading to left ventricular wall rupture. To the best of our knowledge, only 20 cases have been reported so far showing this very rare outcome.A 75-year-old female with past medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, systemic lupus erythematosus, and deep venous thrombosis was transferred from an outside hospital for the management of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient presented to the local emergency department with substernal chest pain radiating to the left jaw and arm and was found to have an elevated troponin (0.26 ng/ml). She was appropriately given aspirin, heparin, and nitroglycerine and was transferred to our medical centre for further care. On presentation, she was alert and oriented, her blood pressure was 200/100 mmHg, nontachycardic, nontachypneic, and sating at 97-98% on 2 litres per minute of oxygen. Pertinent physical exam findings include bibasilar crackles, no murmurs/rubs, normal heart sounds, and no pedal edema. Pertinent laboratory values include haemoglobin (14.2 gm/dl), platelet count (191 k/μl), white count (14.4 k/μl), INR (1.1), creatinine (0.66 mg/dl), and AST (87 μ/l). Electrocardiogram (ECG) on presentation showed sinus rhythm at 74 beats/min, left axis deviation, Q waves in V1 to V3, 1 mm ST segment elevation of V2-V3 (present in prior ECG), and poor R wave progression (Figure 1). A resting 2D Doppler echocardiogram was performed on admission which showed severely reduced ejection fraction of 30-35%, severe hypokinesis of mid to apical segment with more involvement of the mid anteroseptum, and anterior wall with basal hyperkinesia and basal asymmetric hypertrophy of the septum (Figure 2).The decision was made to undergo urgent cardiac catheterization as her chest pain continued to worsen while on nitroglycerine drip, and the troponin on arrival to our facility was elevated (6.80 ng/ml). While in the elevator, en route to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the patient became unresponsive. Resuscitation was immediately started, labs at the time of code blue were significant for acute drop in haemoglobin from 14.2 to 6.2, hypokalaemia of 2.5 mmol/l, and arterial blood gas showed metabolic acidosis (pH of 7.27, pCO2 of 34, pO2 of 28, bicarbonate of 15.2 mmol/l). The catheterization team was unable to establish arterial access hence coronary catheterization was not performed. Unfortunately, despite after aggressive resuscitative efforts for 50 minutes, the patient died.Autopsy was performed and revealed 1000 ml of blood in chest wall cavity. Gross pathology revealed a slit-like rupture of , transmural and located anteriorly 1.5 cm inferior to the base of the heart. The pericardial surface was smooth and tan red in colour (Figure 3). Microscopically, this area had coagulative necrosis, hypereosinophilic appearance of myocytes with abundant ghost cells (cells without nuclei), and cells with pyknotic nuclei. The neutrophilic infiltrate, haemorrhage, and contraction band necrosis can also be visualised (Figure 4). Sacha et al. reported similar rupture site changes indicative of new acute infarct and transmyocardial necrosis leading to rupture in TCM patient [6]. There was epicardial haemorrhage (3.5 cm in length) adjacent to the left anterior descending artery proximal to the site of rupture. Sections in this area revealed area of infarction with early signs of mottling grossly. Interestingly, this area lacked neutrophils suggesting an area of infarction of less than 10 hours. We speculated that this difference in timeline could be due to the discordance of myocardial contraction seen between the apex and base which is often seen in TCM. Most importantly, her major coronary arteries were patent with minimal atherosclerosis and without evidence of organizing thrombus (Figure 5), supporting the histopathological criteria for the diagnosis of TCM.TCM is generally classified by an acute and profound but reversible left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of significant coronary artery disease. The revised Mayo criteria are most commonly used currently to establish diagnosis of TCM which includes combination of clinical presentation, ECG, transthoracic echo, and angiographic finding [7]. It is often triggered by an acute emotional or physical stress [4]. TCM is associated with a catecholamine surge and adrenoceptor hyperactivity which can increase the cardiotoxicity leading to increased chances of complications. Increased levels of norepinephrine in the state of stress can cause localized ventricular wall motion abnormalities and ST segment changes [8]. In our case, we believe the rupture of the left ventricular wall was multifactorial and a consequence of increased afterload due to elevated blood pressure, probable increased catecholamine surge, and adrenoceptor hyperactivity in the setting of acute stress.As per Kumar et al., the characteristics of patients with cardiac rupture in TCM when compared to patients with TCM who did not had cardiac rupture include the following: female gender, older age group, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher frequency of ST elevations in inferior lead, low ejection fraction (EF), and higher left ventricular peak systolic fraction [9]. Our patient portrayed a number of these characteristics including older age, female gender, higher systolic and diastolic pressures, and severely reduced EF.As histopathological slides from our patient showed no thrombus and minimal atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, our case falls into the newly diagnosed category of MINOCA (myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries). TCM is one of the categories of MINOCA; other categories include coronary spasm, coronary dissection, plaque disruption, spontaneous coronary emboli, myocarditis, and coronary microvasculature dysfunction [10]. Our pathological findings were classical for TCM, and apart from the area of rupture, no other area of infarction was seen. Although coronary spasm can also lead to infarction and subsequent death, hence we cannot exclude it definitively, but when our patient’s histological slides are taken in consideration with clinical scenario, TCM is the more likely diagnosis.A thorough literature review of 20 previous cases of TCM complicated with cardiac rupture is listed in Table 1. The characteristics of these patients include 95% females and mean age of 74.9 years. 16 patients presented with chest pain or discomfort (76%); 17 had ST segment elevations (81%); only 9 cases mentioned troponin levels and out of these, 8 showed increased troponin (89%). These findings further support that TCM mimics acute myocardial infarction. Including our case, a total of 17 patients died (81%). The location of rupture was reported in ten cases; six at the apex (60%), two involving the anterior wall (20%), and two involving the posterior wall (20%).The prognosis of TCM is usually favourable, and left ventricular function improves in the majority of cases with conservative management. Currently, there is no standardised treatment protocol for the patients with TCM [24]. Although beta blockers have been suggested in studies to prevent the progression and recurrence of TCM [16], but recent TCM registry results show no survival benefit with beta blocker [4]. The same registry states that the use of angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme was associated with improved survival [4]. Further studies are needed to delineate the role of beta blockers in TCM. The ST segment elevation in TCM is usually transient and recovers within few days; persistent ST elevation is a warning sign for continued myocardial injury and portend an impending ventricular free wall rupture [24]. The treatment of cardiac rupture in the setting of TCM is surgical repair [11]. It is unclear to date whether anticoagulation plays any role in TCM, but apical thrombus formation had been reported in patients with TCM [8].Due to devastating complications of TCM, our case highlights the need for close monitoring of patients with TCM for the first few days. Special consideration should be paid to older female patients as they have higher rates of cardiac rupture.The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.We are really thankful to Dr. James L. Fishback (Chancellor’s Club Distinguished Teaching Professor (Emeritus), Pathology and Lab Medicine) for his help in interpretation of the pathology slides.
Cardiogenic Shock in a Hemodialyzed Patient on Flecainide: Treatment with Intravenous Fat Emulsion, Extracorporeal Cardiac Life Support, and CytoSorb® Hemoadsorption

She was admitted to the Emergency Department for malaise and dizziness, and the electrocardiogram revealed ventricular tachycardia treated by amiodarone. Hemodynamic condition remained stable, and the toxicity of flecainide was initially not suspected until she developed within 8 hours a cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressors. The patient then received sodium bicarbonate (300 mmol) and dobutamine but experienced cardiac arrest two hours later. The administration of intravenous fat emulsion (IFE) was associated with return of spontaneous circulation, but there was a relapse of cardiovascular shock at the end of IFE infusion. The patient was placed on extracorporeal cardiac life support (ECLS), continuous hemofiltration, and hemoadsorption using the CytoSorb® cartridge. Serial determinations of serum flecainide concentration were obtained during the course of hemoadsorption, with a terminal half-life of 3.7 h during the first four hours and a global plasma clearance of 40.3 ml/min over the first 22 hours. The weaning of ECLS was possible on day 7. Intravenous fat emulsion infusion was followed by a significant increase in serum flecainide concentration. In addition, while conventional techniques of extrarenal epuration usually appear as poorly effective for flecainide removal, a mean plasma clearance of 40.3 ml/min was observed using the hemoadsorption technique based on CytoSorb® cartridge. However, the impact on the clinical course was probably extremely modest in comparison with ECLS.Flecainide is a Vaughan Williams class 1C antiarrhythmic drug influencing the fast inward sodium channel during the phase 0 of the action potential. Overdoses with flecainide have been associated with a high mortality rate (22.5%) in comparison with other class 1C molecules. Toxicity is less easily recognized in case of chronic therapy. Ventricular arrhythmias and decreased cardiac contractility in relationship with conduction disturbances are the main complications of flecainide overdose [1]. When the usual cardiopulmonary resuscitation with sodium bicarbonate and catecholamines is failing, rescue therapy with extracorporeal cardiac life support (ECLS) should be promptly considered. We report a case of flecainide toxicity following its therapeutic use in a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition to ECLS, the patient was also treated with intravenous fat emulsion (IFE) and an extrarenal epuration technique based on hemoadsorption (CytoSorb®).A 67-year-old woman (46 kg weight) underwent an aortic valve repair with aortic root replacement for severe dilation of the ascending aorta. In the postoperative period, she developed atrial fibrillation and was then prescribed flecainide two days before hospital discharge. Her other relevant medical history included ESRD requiring chronic hemodialysis, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. Her daily treatment included flecainide 150 mg od, losartan 100 mg od, acenocoumarol, levothyroxine 75 μg od, pantoprazole 40 mg od, calcitriol 0.25 mg od, and cinacalcet 30 mg od. Three weeks after hospital discharge, the patient suddenly felt dizzy and was referred at night to the Emergency Department. A 12 lead electrocardiogram showed an extremely broad QRS complex tachycardia at a rate of 115 bpm and without P waves. The negative concordance of the QRS complexes in the precordial leads, as well as the extreme right QRS axis deviation, was consistent with the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia. The i.v. administration of 300 mg amiodarone resulted in a decrease of heart rate to 78 bpm with a blood pressure of 122/76 mmHg. A second ECG showed a regular rhythm without P waves and with broad QRS complexes (189 ms) and with diffuse repolarization abnormalities. Relevant laboratory investigations were arterial pH 7.44, bicarbonate 22 mmol/l, lactate 1.9 mmol/l, serum creatinine 9.57 mg/dl, urea 99 mg/dl, and hsTnI 40 ng/l. Liver function tests were normal. Blood was also drawn for toxicological investigations, but the results were not immediately available. The patient was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further monitoring of blood pressure and heart rhythm. Systolic blood pressure remained initially above 100 mmHg, heart rate around 75/min, and arterial pH above 7.45. Eight hours after hospital admission, blood pressure progressively decreased and norepinephrine was started. The lactate level started to increase at the same time (7.7 mmol/l). The ICU physician on duty reconsidered the initial diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia as a sign of flecainide toxicity. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a marked interventricular dyssynchrony with severely decreased systolic function of both ventricles. Left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated using the biplane Simpson method at 36%. Cardiac output was calculated at 1920 ml/min. Administration of sodium bicarbonate (300 mmol), calcium gluconate (4 g), and dobutamine was initiated. Over the next 3 hours, the norepinephrine requirements rapidly increased up to 1.5 mcg/kg/min. Lactate levels increased up to 10 mmol/l, and neurological status worsened. The patient was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was started but cardiac arrest (pulseless electrical activity rapidly followed by asystole) occurred. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was immediately performed with 1 mg epinephrine administration every 3 minutes. CPR was briefly interrupted every 2 minutes for rhythm analysis but asystole persisted. Thirteen minutes after the initiation of CPR, intravenous fat emulsion (20% Intralipid®) (IFE) bolus (1.5 ml/kg) was given over 1 minute and was followed one minute later by return of spontaneous circulation. Continuous infusion of IFE was continued at a rate of 0.25 ml/kg/min immediately after bolus administration for a total of 450 ml administered. At the same time, hemodynamics dramatically improved with complete weaning of norepinephrine requirements but without perceptible shortening of the QRS complexes. Five minutes after the end of IFE administration, blood pressure again dropped and norepinephrine was restarted with increasing doses up to 1.5 mcg/kg/min. Initiation of an extracorporeal cardiac life support (ECLS) and transfer to a tertiary center were then decided. In the meantime, profound hypotension occurred (46/28 mmHg). A second bolus of IFE (1.5 ml/kg) was administered, followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.25 ml/kg/min. At the time of venoarterial cannulation for ECLS two hours later by the mobile team of the tertiary hospital, norepinephrine and epinephrine requirements peaked at 2.6 mcg/kg/min and 0.5 mcg/kg/min, respectively. The patient had received an additional dose of 200 mmol of sodium bicarbonate. The lactate level was 19.9 mmol/l. IFE administration was discontinued immediately after cannulation. A total volume of 20% IFE administration was 1500 ml (33 ml/body weight kg).After transfer to the tertiary center, continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) and additional hemoadsorption using CytoSorb® cartridge were started with a blood flow of 200 milliliters per minute. The detailed toxicokinetics of flecainide in relationship with the epuration technique are presented in Figures 1 and 2. The serum flecainide concentration was 3477 ng/ml at the time of admission in the first hospital, well above the therapeutic range (200-1000).Within 72 hours, norepinephrine requirement dropped to less than 0.2 μg/kg/min and QRS duration on ECG was reduced to 98 msec (atrial flutter). After 7 days, echocardiography showed a normal biventricular systolic function and ECLS could be weaned and removed. The patient maintained normal liver function tests over the ICU stay. Further clinical course was marked by pulmonary and abdominal infections, slow respiratory weaning, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient could be discharged to the ward on day 34, with an excellent neurological outcome and recovery of left ventricular function, and had a 6-month uneventful follow-up.Genetic testing for CYP2D6 polymorphism was obtained. The investigated alleles were CYP2D6 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 17, 29, 35, 41, duplication, and deletion. The patient genotype was confirmed to be CYP2D61/4.Flecainide has similar characteristics to other medications for which IFE therapy has been successfully utilized. Flecainide has a large volume of distribution ( (4.9 L/kg)) and a high Log P (octanol/water) coefficient (3.8). This would predict a favorable response to IFE therapy in case of overdose with refractory shock [2]. The hypothesis of a “lipid sink” resulting in a sequestration of lipophilic medications from the receptors sites seems to be supported by some clinical observations contrasting with experimental data. Indeed, in a rabbit experimental model of flecainide poisoning, ILE administration did not result in an increase of plasma flecainide concentration [3]. Besides, IFE was not more effective than hypertonic sodium bicarbonate on the correction of QRS widening [3]. In a case of 2.5 g flecainide overdose, the intravenous infusion of a total of 1 L of 20% IFE was followed by an increase of serum flecainide concentration from 1800 ng/ml 100 minutes pre-IFE administration to 2760 ng/ml 7 hours post-IFE administration. In another patient admitted 90 minutes after a mixed overdose with 25 mg bisoprolol, 900 mg flecainide, and 225 mg aspirin, IFE therapy was administered soon after admission after that the patient had developed ventricular fibrillation. The total flecainide concentration rose from 1512 ng/ml on admission to 2699 ng/ml 9 hours postingestion. However, in both cases, the interpretation of the increase of flecainide concentrations should be cautious as the second sample could have been drawn during the absorption phase of flecainide. In our patient, the increase of serum flecainide concentration could not be ascribed to a prolonged intestinal absorption and the close temporal relationship with IFE administration suggests a sequestration into the intravascular lipid compartment. However, as in other publications, we were not able to determine free flecainide levels as the only pharmacologically active concentrations. We recognize also that the dosage regimen for IFE therapy was excessive in our patient.Approximately 30% of an oral dose of flecainide is excreted in urine as unchanged drug, and in patients with renal impairment, the total clearance of this drug might fall by approximately 40% [1]. Our patient had ESRD requiring intermittent hemodialysis, and a daily dose of 150 mg flecainide was likely excessive. In addition, genetic factors could also reduce flecainide metabolic clearance. Flecainide is primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 and CYP1A enzymes. The patients with the CYP2D61/1 (two functioning alleles) genotype are considered as extensive metabolizers. Our patient was genotyped CYP2D61/4 (4 as an inactive allele) and should be classified as an intermediate metabolizer. Impaired CYP2D6 activity reduces flecainide clearance by 21% in intermediate metabolizers [4]. The restoration of hemodynamic conditions by ECLS, and particularly of liver blood flow, was likely associated with a relative preservation of hepatic clearance.Due to its pharmacological properties, flecainide is not effectively removable by different extrarenal epuration techniques (hemodialysis, hemofiltration, and hemoperfusion), and this has been verified by isolated case reports [5, 6]. Flecainide overdose had not been previously treated with the hemoperfusion cartridge CytoSorb®. The cartridge is characterized by a biocompatible porous polymer absorber with a total surface of exchange of 45,000 m2. It mainly absorbs hydrophobic low and middle molecular substances in a concentration-dependent manner. In vitro data suggest that among cardiovascular drugs, digoxin, amlodipine, and verapamil could be effectively removed, while no data were available for flecainide [7]. The total serum flecainide was well above the therapeutic range at the beginning of hemoadsorption. As expected, the maximal extraction ratio was observed over the first hours. With a mean blood flow of 200 ml/min and a mean extraction ratio of 31%, we can estimate that the clearance of the circuit expressed as plasma clearance was 40.3 ml/min over the first 22 hours. However, we agree that the total plasma clearance of flecainide is represented by the sum of the metabolic (hepatic) clearance and of the clearance related to CVVHDF and CytoSorb®. The exact contribution of hemoadsorption to the clinical improvement could not be easily assessed as other therapies were simultaneously applied. This is particularly true for ECLS that has been applied with success in several cases of refractory (but transient) cardiogenic shock [8–10]. The concurrent or sequential use of both IFE and ECLS in case of drug-related cardiovascular toxicity is still uncommon with a possible negative influence of IFE on the tubing, valves, and circuits [11]. The influence of IFE on the CytoSorb® cartridge is also not known. It is also likely that the efficacy of CytoSorb® on flecainide epuration could decrease with time following cartridge saturation.The limitations of this single observation have to be acknowledged. First, sodium bicarbonate should have been administered earlier, as soon as flecainide toxicity is suspected, and the total amount of IFE here exceeded the recommended dose. As IFE was not the sole medication used during resuscitation, the apparent clinical improvement could not be ascribed to IFE therapy only. Second, the respective role of each intervention (ECLS, CVVHDF, and hemoadsorption) for the hemodynamic improvement remains difficult to establish, but ECLS was undoubtedly the most saving technique. Third, the effectiveness of the CytoSorb® cartridge for flecainide removal cannot be fully appreciated by the calculations of blood extraction as the amount of drug coated on the cartridge cannot be determined.Learning Objective. Therapeutic use of flecainide in patients with end-stage renal disease may be associated with serious toxicity. When standard therapy is failing following refractory cardiogenic shock, extracorporeal cardiac life support combined with sequestration of flecainide in a lipid phase followed by hemoadsorption could be helpful in selected cases.A written consent was obtained from the patient.The authors report no conflict of interest.
Acute Deterioration of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) in a Patient with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)
1Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Kitakyushu Municipal Yahata Hospital, 2-6-2 Okura, Yahatahigashi-ku, Kitakyushu 805-8534, Japan2Department of Internal Medicine, Kitakyushu Municipal Yahata Hospital, 2-6-2 Okura, Yahatahigashi-ku, Kitakyushu 805-8534, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Seiya Tanaka; moc.em@akanatayasReceived 13 March 2019; Accepted 3 June 2019; Published 22 July 2019Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2019 Seiya Tanaka et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 56-year-old woman was diagnosed as having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with heavy smoking. Mild pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary arterial pressure: 31 mmHg) was detected at the first visit. She was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary disease and medicated only with bronchodilators. Simultaneous, multiple freckling in the trunk of her body and café au lait macules in her back with some cutaneous neurofibromas were also detected. A plastic surgeon removed one of the neurofibromas and pathologically diagnosed it as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We finally rediagnosed her with pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial factors when she deteriorated 1 year after being treated only with bronchodilators. We then administrated upfront combination therapy with macitentan and tadalafil. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure rapidly improved. Learning Objective. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can occur due to lung disease or due to certain involvement of pulmonary arteries, or a combination of both. Increased awareness of PAH in NF1 is very important for patients survival. The current therapeutic strategy is almost identical to that of idiopathic PAH; however, there is no clinical evidence. Insights gained from clinical experiences should help identify promising novel therapeutic approaches in NF1-PAH.Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a relatively common genetic disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in 4000 live births. NF1 is characterized by cutaneous neurofibromatosis and café au lait spots, and they are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern [1, 2]. Arterial vasculopathies are well-recognized manifestations of this disease and one of the most important causes of a poor prognosis in patients in NF1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with NF1 is included in the current classification of pulmonary hypertension in the group with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms [3–5]. The present case was initially treated for pulmonary hypertension with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which belongs to group 3 of the clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension [6]. In recognition of NF1 as a distinct cause of PAH, we propose that it should be termed NF1-associated PAH.A 54-year-old woman was diagnosed with COPD. Her blood pressure was 104/56 mmHg, pulse was 87 beats/min, and respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min. She was in WHO functional class II. She had multiple both cutaneous neurofibromas and café au lait macules and freckling in her back and the axilla (Figure 1). She was referred to the Department of Respiratory Medicine of our hospital in 2016. Right heart cardiac catheterization (RHC) showed mild pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 49/13 (mean: 31 mmHg), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 7 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 476 dyne·s·cm−5. Cardiac output (CO) was 4.0 L/min and the cardiac index was 2.9 L/min/m2. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed markedly enlarged central pulmonary arteries, upper-lobe centrilobular emphysema with multiple bullae, and bilateral ground-glass nodules with multiple cystic lesions in the lower lobe (Figure 2). A 99mTc macroaggregated albumin lung perfusion scan showed perfusion defects of bilateral upper lobes, and these defects matched emphysematous lesions of her lung. An obstructive pattern was observed in a respiratory functional test as follows: forced expiratory volume in 1 s, 1.86 L (83% of predicted); forced vital capacity 2.88 (105.5% of predicted); and diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide 3.6 ml/min/mmHg (23.9% of predicted). The results of the tests for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-scleroderma antibody, anti-smith antibody, anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody, and anti-Sjogren’s syndrome A/Sjogren’s syndrome B antibodies were all negative. The patient denied any history of diet drug use, human immunodeficiency virus risk factors, obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, or rheumatological symptoms.At initial assessment, she was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension in the group of pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease. A respiratory physician initiated full medications of bronchodilators and home oxygen therapy to her. She did not have a family history of NF1 or PAH. She had already noticed neurofibromas when she was in elementary school. She did not have any symptoms associated with the neurofibromas but had always wanted to remove some of them cosmetically. She consulted a plastic surgeon in our hospital for the first time. He removed two of her neurofibromas and pathologically diagnosed them as NF1.One year after medicating with bronchodilators, her exertional dyspnea progressed to WHO functional class III. Echocardiography showed enlargement of the right ventricle with ventricular septal flattening during systole (Figure 3). RHC showed hemodynamic deterioration. PAP and PVR were increased to 81/26 (mean: 48 mmHg) and 1041 dyne·s·cm−5, respectively. CO was decreased to 2.92 L/min. HRCT showed no change in lung parenchymal involvement. A respiratory functional test also showed no change. These results suggested that COPD did not contribute to her deterioration. At this point, the patient’s diagnosis was likely PAH associated with NF-1. Recent classification of pH places in group 5 which is systemic disorders with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms [6]. The treatment algorithm for group 1 pulmonary hypertension in the European Society of Cardiology and the European Respiratory Society guidelines was applied [7]. We chose the upfront combination therapy with macitentan 10 mg and tadalafil 40 mg because our patient was in WHO functional class III and the prognosis of NF-1 associated with PAH is extremely poor [3, 8]. These reports suggested that treatment of NF1 with PAH should be modeled on treatment of group 1 PAH. After 1 month, our patient’s symptom was relieved to WHO functional class II. RHC showed hemodynamic improvement. PAP and PVR were decreased to 49/17 (mean: 30 mmHg) and 356 dyne·s·cm−5, respectively. Currently, 1 year after upfront combination therapy, the patient’s condition is stable.NF1 is an autosomal dominant condition that is caused by heterozygous mutations of the NF1 gene, which is located on chromosome 17 [2]. NF1 has approximately 100% penetrance and variable phenotype expression, and 50% of cases are sporadic. This disorder mainly involves the skin, peripheral nervous system (neurofibromatosis), and iris (Lisch nodules). Our patient met the diagnosis of NF1 because she had more than six café au lait macules of >15 mm in greatest diameter, multiple cutaneous neurofibromas, and axillary freckling [9].The prognosis is generally good in most patients with NF1. However, the clinical course of NF1 is occasionally complicated by arterial vasculopathies, which involve the cerebral renal coronary and peripheral vascular beds. Pulmonary arteriopathy and secondary PAH with NF1 (NF1-PAH) are rare and their underlying mechanisms are unclear and multifactorial. This condition is classified as group 5 in an updated comprehensive version of the clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension [7]. To the best of our knowledge, only 23 cases of this association have been reported [3–5, 8]. NF1-PAH is an extremely severe complication of NF1 and is characterized by late-onset, female predominance, severe functional and hemodynamic impairment, a poor response to PAH-specific agents, and a poor outcome.In our patient, a respiratory physician initially concluded that COPD was responsible for dyspnea or pulmonary hypertension. However, even under the full medication with bronchodilators and home oxygen therapy, her condition suddenly deteriorated without progression of lung parenchymal lesions. The etiological diagnosis of NF1-PAH is difficult in the presence of lung parenchymal lesions because lung abnormalities are variable in patients with NF1. A PFT invariably shows some obstructive, restrictive, or mixed patterns. Most of these patients have an impaired diffusion capacity, even with a normal lung volume, which suggests vascular involvement. Ventilation perfusion scans and chest HRCT showed bilateral filling defects and a mosaic pattern (representing irregular perfusion) in our patient, which also suggested vascular involvement as a primary cause of PAH. Although there are currently no specific therapeutic guidelines for NF1-PAH, optimal management requires the advice of an expert referral center [7]. Little is known about the pulmonary arteries in NF1-PAH. Plexogenic arteriopathy and complex plexiform lesions similar to those observed in idiopathic PAH have been observed in autopsy specimens in NF1-PAH [3]. This evidence suggests that treatment of NF1-PAH should be equivalent to treatment of group 1 PAH. We decided to use upfront combination therapy of an endothelin receptor antagonist and a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor.A recent report indicated that degenerated pulmonary vasculature in NF1-associated PAH is affected by NF1 vasculopathy [10]. Another report showed that regulation of Ras by NF1 plays a critical role in vascular smooth muscle proliferation [6]. Sorafenib is an oral inhibitor of multiple kinases, including Raf-1, which is the downstream target of Ras in the MAPK cascade, and may have a beneficial therapeutic effect in NF1-PAH.Pulmonary hypertension in patients with NF1 can occur because of parenchymal lung disease, certain involvement of pulmonary arteries, or a combination of both. Recognizing this association is important because it implicates mutations in the NF1 gene with the pathogenesis of pulmonary vasculopathy. Furthermore, early recognition is warranted because of rapid progression and poor prognosis.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.We thank Ellen Knapp, PhD, from Edanz Group (http://www.edanzediting.com/ac) for editing the draft of this manuscript.
Pulmonary Artery and Pulmonic Valve Vegetations in a Young Pregnant Filipino with Patent Ductus Arteriosus
Section of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital, PhilippinesCorrespondence should be addressed to Valerie R. Ramiro; moc.oohay@orimarrvReceived 2 January 2019; Revised 12 May 2019; Accepted 19 June 2019; Published 9 July 2019Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2019 Valerie R. Ramiro et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Background. Infective endocarditis (IE) involving the pulmonic valve and/or the pulmonary artery is rare. An unrepaired patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a risk factor for IE. A previous IE is also a risk factor that predisposes to IE recurrence. Discriminating between IE recurrence and a persistence of a vegetation from a previously treated IE can be difficult. We present the case of a 19-year-old primigravid with an unrepaired PDA and a history of IE treated 7 years prior, with positive blood cultures and vegetations on the pulmonic valve and pulmonary artery seen on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Methods and Results. On TTE, a small-sized PDA with a Qp : Qs of 1.18 and vegetations on the pulmonic valve and pulmonary artery were documented. Despite the paucity of symptoms, she was empirically treated as culture-negative IE and given 2 weeks of ceftriaxone. Repeat TTE done after 2 weeks only showed a slight decrease in the vegetation size. Due to the paucity of symptoms of infection, lack of growth of the vegetation, and absence of embolic events, the vegetations were deemed to be persistent remnants from the previous IE rather than a recurrent IE. She was advised surgical PDA closure and harvest of vegetations after delivery, but the patient did not consent. The rest of her perinatal course was uneventful. Conclusion. Persistence of vegetations despite successful medical treatment occurs in some cases and has not been reported to be associated with increased morbidity. Therefore, a follow-up of IE after treatment should be guided by the clinical course and response to therapy as well as the echocardiographic morphology of vegetations over time.The involvement of the pulmonic valve and the pulmonary artery in infective endocarditis (IE) is rare. Unrepaired congenital heart disease (CHD), including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), is a risk factor for IE. A previous IE is likewise a significant risk factor that predisposes to IE recurrence. Discriminating between IE recurrence and a persistence of a vegetation from a previously treated IE can be difficult. This paper is aimed at describing a case of pulmonic valve and pulmonary artery vegetations in a pregnant patient with an unrepaired PDA and a distant history of IE treatment. This is the first documented case of pulmonic valve and pulmonary artery vegetation in a patient with a PDA in our institution.This is the case of 19-year-old primigravid with an unrepaired PDA who was incidentally found to have vegetations on the pulmonary artery and pulmonic valve on routine prenatal transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).She had an unremarkable childhood until 10 years old when she was diagnosed with moderate patent ductus arteriosus, presenting as exertional dyspnea. She was lost to follow-up until 2 years later, at 12 years old, when she was admitted at the emergency room for edema, exertional dyspnea, and orthopnea. On physical examination, she was in respiratory distress, tachypneic with alar flaring, and had bilateral crackles. She was initially treated for community-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis, with initial blood cultures yielding Streptococcus viridans. This was treated with Penicillin G. However, despite improvement of pneumonia, she was persistently febrile. Repeat blood cultures were positive for Pseudomonas putida. A TTE revealed multiple vegetations at the pulmonary artery and pulmonic valve. The IE was then treated with a 6-week course of intravenous meropenem. Furosemide, digoxin, and enalapril were also initiated for the heart failure. Surgery to close the PDA and remove the vegetations was offered but was not done due to the lack of consent and funds. Serial TTE done during the following year did not show a significant decrease in the size of the pulmonary artery masses. She was again lost to follow-up but continued taking furosemide, digoxin, and enalapril.She returned to our institution for prenatal care. She discontinued taking furosemide, enalapril, and digoxin at the start of pregnancy. Given her history of a congenital heart disease, a TTE was ordered as part of the prenatal work-up. The TTE was done on her 29th week AOG, and it revealed a PDA with a computed Qp : Qs of 1.18 (see Figure 1), as well as vegetations on the pulmonic valve and pulmonary artery (see Figure 2).Despite the absence of fever and signs of worsening heart failure, she was preemptively admitted and treated empirically for IE with intravenous ceftriaxone. During this period, she did not have fever nor signs of decompensation. Serial blood cultures were negative. On repeat TTE after 2 weeks, there was only a slight decrease in the size of the vegetation and it was treated as a persistent vegetation from her previous bout of IE at 12 years old. She was advised surgery, for closure of the PDA and harvest of vegetations, after delivery, but the patient did not consent. The rest of her perinatal course was uneventful.According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), at present, 0.2 to 4% of all pregnancies in western industrialized countries are complicated by cardiovascular diseases. Maternal heart disease, in general, is now said to be the major cause of maternal death during pregnancy. Because of improved treatment of CHD during childhood, more of these patients reach child-bearing age. In western countries, CHD is the most frequent cardiovascular disease present during pregnancy (75–82%) [1]. In our institution, rheumatic heart disease is still the predominant cardiac complication among pregnant patients followed by CHD [2]. Another study done in our institution showed that among pregnant patients with CHD, PDA (20%) was one of the most common lesions encountered [3]. Patients with small-sized PDA, without Eisenmenger syndrome, may tolerate pregnancy well [1].An unrepaired PDA is a risk factor for IE, and when it occurs, the vegetation is often on the pulmonary artery side of the PDA [4]. The proposed pathogenesis of IE associated with CHD involves complex interactions among the damaged valvular or mural endocardium exposing the matrix proteins to thromboplastin and tissue factor, formation of a nonbacterial thrombotic endarteritis, and eventual microbial adherence, colonization, and replication [4]. The turbulent blood flow through the aorta and pulmonary artery which causes endothelial injury and subsequent seeding of pathogens onto the injured endothelium is central to the proposed pathogenetic mechanisms for the development of vegetations particularly in patients with PDA [5].IE involving the pulmonic valve is rare. The estimated incidence of IE associated with PDA was reported to be 1% per year with the decline in recent years attributed to early treatment with routine closure of PDA, improved dental care, and prevalent use of antibiotics both for prophylaxis and for IE treatment [4]. A review done by Knirsch and Nadal in 2011 on IE in CHD presented pooled percentages of distribution of IE according to anatomical localization based on data of retrospective clinical studies. Affectation of the pulmonic valve was 8.8%, the pulmonary artery was 2.3%, and the PDA was 2.7% [6]. A retrospective study done in our institution by Javier et al. reviewed 135 cases of patients with TTE findings consistent with IE from 2004 to 2009. Of these, 91 cases fulfilled Duke’s criteria for definite IE. On their review, they found that CHD was the second most common underlying cardiac abnormality (17.5%), 21.1% of which was PDA [7].There have been several case reports on IE involving either the pulmonary artery or the pulmonic valve, but their outcomes have either been unknown as the patient was lost to follow-up [8] or documented to be resolved by surgical resection or antibiotics [5, 9–11]. In our patient’s case, the vegetation persisted despite completion of culture-guided antibiotic therapy during her initial episode of IE at 12 years old. A surgical harvest of the vegetation with concomitant closure of the PDA was not performed at the time as the patient was lost to follow-up.A previous IE is a significant risk factor that predisposes to IE recurrence. A prospective cohort study by Alagna in 2013 reported a 4.8% rate of repeat IE. A previous IE was one of the associated risk factors, with odds ratio of 2.8 (95% CI 1.6-5.4) [12]. However, in patients with poor documentation or recall of their past medical history, discriminating between IE recurrence and a persistent or residual vegetation from a previously treated IE may be difficult.There is no strong recommendation for the closure of a PDA to prevent an initial attack especially for small or silent PDA [13]. However, in our patient who had a history of previous IE, a surgical closure of the PDA with concomitant harvest of vegetations was warranted. Unfortunately, the patient did not consent to the procedure despite being advised of the risk of embolization of the vegetation and the risk of Eisenmenger syndrome.Resolution of the vegetation after antibiotic treatment is one of the indications of successful treatment of IE. However, a 1994 retrospective study by Vuille et al. describing the natural course of vegetations after medical therapy found that out of 41 vegetations, 29 vegetations persisted at the end of treatment (59% of which had no significant change in size, and 52% appeared denser). This led to the conclusion that despite successful medical treatment, persistence of vegetations is still commonly demonstrated echocardiographically and that treatment of IE should be guided by the clinical evolution or response to therapy, rather than the echocardiographic changes of a vegetation [14]. In recent years, this concept is still maintained. The 2010 ESC recommendations for the practice of echocardiography in IE also acknowledge the difficulty of interpreting an unchanged or reduced vegetation size with antibiotic treatment. However, the progressive growth of a vegetation and increasing valvular regurgitation foreshadow poor prognosis as they are risk factors for embolic events and morbidity [15]. The mere persistence of a vegetation despite paucity of supportive evidence for IE, such as symptoms or positive blood cultures, is not associated with increased morbidity [16]. Therefore, a follow-up of IE after treatment should be guided mainly by the clinical course and response to therapy and not only by the change over time of the echocardiographic morphology of vegetations.This case report has been presented in the following conferences: (i) poster presentation, Echo ASE ASEAN Symposium, Manila, Philippines, March 2018; (ii) poster presentation, Asian Pacific Society of Cardiology Congress, Taipei, Taiwan, May 2018; and (iii) third place, oral presentation, Philippine General Hospital Annual Research Forum, October 2018.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
A Cardiogenic Shock due to an Acute MI with LCA Arising from the Right Coronary Sinus Successfully Treated with PCI

The left coronary artery (LCA) originating from the right coronary sinus is a very rare CAA with a frequency of 0.03%. We present a very rare case of a cardiogenic shock as a consequence of an acute anterolateral myocardial infarction by a totally occlusive lesion in the long left main stem with a complete LCA arising from the right coronary sinus in an 85-year-old female. This lesion was successfully treated with 2 drug-eluting stents. This is perhaps the first published case about cardiogenic shock due to an acute myocardial infarction associated with this type of coronary anomalies, and it presents a special challenge in the catheter laboratory.Coronary artery anomalies (CAAs) are a diverse group of congenital anomalies with an incidence ranging from 0.17% in autopsy cases to 1.2% in patients undergoing coronary angiography [1, 2]. They are so interesting, as they form the second most frequent cause of sudden death in young athletes [3, 4]. It is reported that sudden death due to coronary arteries arising from the opposite sinus (ACAOS) is more frequent in young athletes <35 years than in older patients. It has been suggested that sudden death is less common in the latter group because of the stiffening of the aortic wall [5, 6].We present a very rare case of a cardiogenic shock resulting from an acute myocardial infarction (MI) with a complete LCA arising from the right coronary sinus. With a frequency of 0.02%-0.05% on angiographic studies, this anomaly is one of the most uncommon coronary anomalies [2, 7].An 85-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a three-hour history of a typical anginal chest discomfort associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. The patient denied a history of coronary heart disease and was well anticoagulated for an atrial fibrillation. The patient was afebrile and her heart rate was 123 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 65/40 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation was 92% on 4 l/min via nasal cannula. On physical exam, she was in respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 30 per minute and had no peripheral edema. On auscultation of the chest, she had diffuse bilateral crackles. The cardiac examination revealed an irregular rhythm without murmurs. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on presentation demonstrated ST elevations in leads I and aVL and ST depressions in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)).Blood gas analysis (BGA) revealed increased lactate of 4.2 mmol/l.She underwent an emergency coronary angiography. The left main coronary artery (LMCA) could not be engaged with conventional diagnostic catheters for which an aortic root angiography using a pigtail catheter was performed and raised suspicion that the left coronary artery (LCA) was originating from the right coronary sinus. The injection of contrast in the right coronary sinus demonstrated an anomalous LCA separately arising from the right coronary sinus. The culprit lesion was a 100% occlusion in the distal LMCA and proximal left ascending artery (LAD) with grade 0 TIMI flow (Figure 2(a)). For the intervention, a 6F Amplatz right guide catheter (AR-1) was chosen, which engaged the LCA-ostium and provided an acceptable backup. Percutaneous intervention was performed with two drug-eluting stents achieving grade 3 TIMI postintervention without residual stenosis or complications (Figure 2(b)). The left coronary circumflex (LCX) was hypoplastic; therefore, it was ignored in the intervention strategy. The right coronary artery (RCA) was dominant and was divided at the crux of the heart into two large branches and continued posterolaterally as a large posterior lateral branch.Postintervention ECG showed no significant ST elevations or ST depressions (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)).During the procedure, a vasopressor was infused in small doses and multiple doses of intravenous diuretics were given.After that, the patient was transferred to an intensive care unit; she did not require invasive ventilation. In two days, she was weaned off catecholamines and stepped down to the ward in good clinical status.The CAAs are classified into anomalies (1) of origin, (2) of courses, and (3) of termination.The LCA originating from the right coronary sinus is a very unusual CAA.It is difficult to engage the ostium in this anomaly, which makes an intervention in emergency settings particularly complex. The Amplatz right guide catheter seems to be suitable for this type of coronary anomalies.To our knowledge, this is the first report of this anomaly with a cardiogenic shock related to a 100% occlusive lesion in the anomalous LCA successfully treated with percutaneous intervention (PCI). One previous case from Korea has described the same anomaly with an acute coronary syndrome by an up-to-90% occlusive lesion in the proximal LAD [8]. Shah et al. reported a similar case which was successfully treated with percutaneous intervention [9].The clinical implications of CAAs vary depending on the type of anomalous artery and range, from ischemia presenting at an early stage of life to an incidental finding on angiography [10].Coronary arteries arising from the opposite sinus (ACAOS), like the anomaly in our case, are the second leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes in the United States [11].Although their incidence is low, CAAs should always be taken into consideration by clinicians due to their potentially fatal consequences.Cardiologists in the catheter laboratory should have the required experience to intervene on such anomalous coronary arteries, especially in the situation of cardiogenic shock.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.
Peripherally Embolizing Aortic Thrombus: The Work-Up, Management, and Outcome of Primary Aortic Thrombus
1Department of Internal Medicine, Beaumont Health System, Royal Oak, MI, USA2Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Lansing, MI, USA3Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beaumont Health System, Royal Oak, MI, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Ramy Mando; gro.tnomuaeb@odnam.ymarReceived 20 March 2019; Accepted 13 June 2019; Published 2 July 2019Academic Editor: Ming-Ren ChenCopyright © 2019 Ramy Mando et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Background. Primary aortic thrombus is an uncommon entity and not frequently reported in the literature. Herein, we discuss the presentation and management of a patient with a primary thoracic mural thrombus. Case Summary. A 46-year-old female with past medical history of tobacco dependence presented for low-grade fever and sudden onset, severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain with associated nausea and vomiting. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an intraluminal polypoid filling defect arising from the isthmus of the aorta projecting into the proximal descending aorta and findings consistent with infarction of the spleen and right kidney. Infectious, autoimmune, hematologic, and oncologic work-up were all unyielding. The patient was started on heparin and later transitioned to apixaban 5 mg twice a day and 81 mg of aspirin daily. She was also counseled regarding smoking cessation. Two months follow-up CT revealed resolution of the thrombus. Patient had no further thromboembolic complications. Discussion. We present a unique case of primary aortic thrombus. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case managed successfully with a NOAC. This diagnosis is one of exclusion and through work-up should be completed. Our aim is to raise awareness of this condition and successful management with apixaban in low-risk patients.Aortic mural thrombi are uncommon and typically associated with severe atherosclerosis or the presence of an aneurysm. Even more uncommon is the formation of a primary aortic thrombus with no infectious, neoplastic, traumatic, autoimmune, or hypercoagulable triggers responsible for thrombus formation. To date, there is no consensus on the management of this condition; however, options include anticoagulation, thrombolytics, aortic surgery, and thromboaspiration. Herein, we describe a rare case of primary aortic thrombus presenting with systemic embolization to the lower extremities, kidney, and spleen. This is one of the first cases in the literature describing effective management of this condition with a direct oral anticoagulant.Thrombi in the thoracic aorta are most commonly associated with severe atherosclerosis or aortic aneurysm [1, 2]. Primary thrombus of the aorta in the absence of aneurysm, moderate-to-severe atherosclerosis, hypercoagulability, malignancy, infections, or autoimmune conditions is exceedingly rare [2–4]. Management of primary aortic thrombus is not well defined at this time [5, 6]. Herein, we describe the rare case of a thoracic aortic thrombus with peripheral embolization presenting as abdominal pain and lower extremity pain. This is one of the first cases in the literature describing the use of direct oral anticoagulants in the management of primary aortic thrombi. We aim to raise awareness of this condition and summarize pathophysiology as well as current treatment options available to us.A 46-year-old female with past medical history of tobacco dependence presented for low-grade fever and sudden onset of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain with associated nausea and vomiting. Computed tomography (CT) completed in the emergency department revealed an intraluminal polypoid filling defect arising from the isthmus of the aorta projecting into the proximal descending aorta and findings consistent with infarctions of the spleen and right kidney (Figures 1(a)–1(c)). Given the fever, there was a concern for sepsis so she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Heparin has also initiated cardioembolic phenomena of unclear etiology; however, it was later discontinued to prevent hemorrhagic transformation of the existing infarcts. The patient was admitted for further evaluation.A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no findings to suggest valvular or cardiac source of embolus (Figure 2). An agitated saline bubble contrast study was performed with no evidence of intracardiac shunting (Figure 3). A transesophageal echocardiogram was then completed and revealed a large echogenic mobile mass attached to the wall of the descending thoracic aorta (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). Bilateral lower extremity arterial Dopplers were obtained and revealed severe popliteal-tibial arterial disease in the left lower extremity (Figure 5).Work-up for other organic causes was extensive. Infectious work-up was negative and included testing for bacterial infection, fungal infection, HIV, Bartonella henselae antibody, Coxiella burnetii antibodies, Leptospira antibodies, syphilis, aspergillus galactomannan antigen, and histoplasma antigen. Hypercoagulability work-up was also unremarkable and included DRVVT screening for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies (×2), homocysteine levels, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria screening, Protein C and S activity, antithrombin mutations, and factor V Leiden and prothrombin genotyping. Autoimmune work-up was also unyielding and included testing for antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antidouble-stranded DNA antibody, rheumatoid factor, cyclic citrullinated peptide, Sjogren antibody, myeloperoxidase antibodies, proteinase 3 autoantibodies, complement levels, Smith antibody, and RNP antibody. Given that there are no acute threat to limb or organ ischemia, the largely negative work-up, and no straight-forward mechanism to remove the aortic thrombus, we decided to manage the patient medically with close outpatient follow-up. She was started on heparin while inpatient which was transitioned to apixaban 5 mg twice a day and 81 mg of aspirin daily. This was done primarily because of the patient’s preference to avoid frequent INR checks. A board-certified hematologist agreed with the use of apixaban with monthly outpatient follow-up to ensure patient compliance and clinical improvement. Patient was also counseled regarding smoking cessation. Catheter-based or surgical thromboembolectomy would have been considered if the patient would have developed acute limb ischemia or threatened organ.At one month, the patient was seen in the clinic and denied symptoms of chest, back, or abdominal pain. She denied significant pain at rest or with exertion and did not exhibit any nonhealing wounds in either of her lower extremities. She noted being able to walk roughly one-quarter of a mile without symptoms prior to resting. She reported adherence with her daily aspirin and twice-daily Eliquis. At this time, arterial computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated which revealed complete resolution of the filling defect involving the aortic isthmus and proximal descending aorta. There was no CT evidence to suggest vacuities. The spleen exhibited a lobulated superior margin with volume loss and the right kidney demonstrated a lobulated appearance of the right lower pole compatible with scarring from the previous infarct (Figure 6). The patient was instructed to continue with her antithrombotic regimen and follow-up in one month.At this time, the patient no longer expressed having any symptoms of LE pain, swelling, or claudication. She reported being able to resume her daily activities with no limitations. Findings of the CTA were discussed with the patient at her two-month follow-up, and she was encouraged to continue with activity as tolerated. At this time, given the resolution of the mass after anticoagulation, it was felt that it was most likely an aortic thrombus. With regards the duration of therapy, we felt that this was likely unprovoked, and given it was arterial, we decided to continue anticoagulation for at least 12 more months pending further hematologic evaluation.Arterial thrombus is a rare clinical entity, particularly in the absence of aneurysm or severe atherosclerosis. The incidence of embolic events is higher in mobile pedunculated thrombi when compared to those that are layered and immobile (73% versus 12% risk of embolization, respectively) [7]. The most common manifestation includes consequences related to thromboembolic phenomena, as seen in our patient [2]. These complications are serious; therefore, early detection and management of their causes are imperative to patient care.Aortic thrombi are typically secondary to aneurysmal disease, dissection, or severe atherosclerosis [5]. Alternative pathologies which may predispose one to being at risk for arterial thrombosis should always be investigated in efforts of preventing future thrombi and their sequela. Potential causes include trauma, malignancy, hypercoagulable states (factor V Leiden mutation, polycythemia, antithrombin III deficiency, protein C and/or S deficiency, etc.) and autoimmune disorders [2, 8–10]. Other risk factors including the presence of microscopic atherosclerotic disease (difficult to exclude clinically), smoking, and oral contraceptive use should also be addressed in patients as appropriate.Distal embolization of the thrombus causes symptoms specific to the affected organ. Thromboembolic seeding to the renal vasculature can lead to acute kidney injury and failure depending on the renal mass distal to the blocked artery [11]. Complications of seeding to the spleen include, but are not limited to, left upper quadrant pain, anemia, leukocytosis, splenic pseudocyst, abscess, or hemorrhage [12]. Any of the four major types of acute mesenteric ischemic (acute superior mesenteric artery thromboembolic occlusion, mesenteric arterial thrombosis, mesenteric venous thrombosis, and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia) are all potential complications of thrombus seeding to the colonic vasculature and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality [13]. Emboli seeding to the lower extremities can lead to acute limb ischemia which has an amputation rate of 13-15% and mortality rate of 9-12% [14].Studies and guideline-directed management options are currently limited, and there have not been any prospective trials addressing therapeutic strategies. Options for treatment include anticoagulation, aortic surgery, thrombolytic therapy, and thromboaspiration [1, 15, 16]. The most common approach to initial management is anticoagulation [2, 5]. In patients with recurrence of distal arterial embolization or persistence of thrombus, aortic surgery may be considered [5, 17, 18]. Several studies have been published suggesting that aggressive management with aortic surgery may lead to less recurrence of distal embolization and complications including distal limb amputation particularly those in the ascending aorta or aortic arch [1, 2, 5, 19]. In our patient, given her vastly negative evaluation and lack of risk factors, we choose to purse management with apixaban and aspirin. Furthermore, there was significant concern for distal embolization given its location and mobility. To our knowledge, we are reporting one of the first case treated successfully with a non-vitamin K–dependent oral anticoagulant.Our patient is unique in that a very extensive evaluation was unsuccessful in identifying the etiology of arterial thrombus formation. Our working diagnoses were broad throughout the case and included endocarditis, paradoxical embolism, cardiac neoplasm, and all potential causes of aortitis. After excluding infectious sources through an extensive evaluation and autoimmune conditions which may have led to aortitis, we decided to treat the patient empirically with apixaban and low-dose aspirin. Fortunately, our patient’s thrombus resolved, and she experienced no residual symptoms at two months follow-up.Primary aortic thrombus is a rare entity which has been previously described in the literature. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, and infectious, malignant, hypercoagulable, and autoimmune causes must be excluded. With regards to treatment, some studies recommend aggressive management to prevent risk of thrombus recurrence and arterial embolization while others recommend more conservative, less invasive medical management; however, there is no expert consensus or guidelines to direct therapy or its duration at this time. Given the lack of standardized guidelines at this time, we recommend a patient-specific approach which considers anticipated adherence to medications and follow-up, risk factors, results of laboratory work-up, and risk of further embolization. In low-risk patients, we propose that the use of a direct factor Xa inhibitors for oral anticoagulation may be an acceptable alternative to coumadin.All authors declare no conflicts of interest.Images obtained by transesophageal echocardiogram of a large mass (thrombus) attached to the wall of the descending thoracic aorta.

Monomorphic Ventricular Tachycardia as a Presentation of Giant Cell Myocarditis
Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, Cummings School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Alberta, CanadaCorrespondence should be addressed to Michael H. Chiu; ac.sha@uihc.leahcimReceived 4 January 2019; Revised 5 April 2019; Accepted 27 May 2019; Published 19 June 2019Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2019 Michael H. Chiu et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Background. Idiopathic giant cell myocarditis (GCM) has a fulminant course and typically presents in middle-aged adults with acute heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia. It is a rare disorder which involves T lymphocyte-mediated myocardial inflammation. Diagnosis is challenging and requires a high index of suspicion since therapy may improve an otherwise uniformly fatal prognosis. Case Summary. A previously healthy 54-year-old female presented with hemodynamically significant ventricular arrhythmia (VA) and was found to have severe left ventricular dysfunction. Cardiac MRI demonstrated acute myocarditis, and endomyocardial biopsy showed giant cell myocarditis. She was treated with combined immunosuppressive therapy as well as guideline-directed medical therapy. A secondary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted. Discussion. GCM is a rare, lethal myocarditis subtype but is potentially treatable. Combined immunosuppression may achieve partial clinical remission in two-thirds of patients. VA is common, and patients should undergo ICD implantation. More research is needed to better understand this complex disease. Learning Objectives. Giant cell myocarditis is an incompletely understood, rare cause of myocarditis. Patients present predominately with heart failure and dysrhythmia. Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathology, and immunosuppression may improve outcomes. ICD implantation should be considered. In the absence of treatment, prognosis is poor with a median survival of three months.Idiopathic giant cell myocarditis is a rare clinical entity first recognized in the early 1950s [1]. GCM has a fulminant course with an autoimmune pathophysiology in virus-negative GCM [2, 3]. Often fatal due to arrhythmia or heart failure, two-thirds of patients exhibit response to immunosuppressive therapy, and some undergo cardiac transplantation [2]. We report a case of a previously healthy female diagnosed with idiopathic giant cell myocarditis.A previously healthy 54-year-old female presented to emergency services with acute onset of malaise, nausea, palpitations, and presyncope. Her ECG showed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at 230 bpm, and she underwent successful cardioversion. Hemodynamic stability was restored, and she was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit.Initial cardiovascular examination was pertinent for a positive abdominojugular reflux sign and a third heart sound. There was no clinical evidence of pulmonary or systemic congestion or low cardiac output state, and no other manifestations of systemic disorders were present.ECG in sinus rhythm revealed a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay with a QRS duration of 130 ms, a P wave of 1 mm in the lead II, a PR interval of 166 ms, and a QTc of 507 ms at a heart rate of 96 bpm. Transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction of 35%, preserved right ventricular function, and no valvular abnormalities (aortic root dimension of 2.9 cm, left atrium of 3.2 cm, LV diastole of 4.9 cm, LV systole of 4.0 cm, fractional shortening of 18.6%, interventricular septum of 0.85 cm, posterior wall of 0.78 cm, left atrium volume index of 36.3 ml/m2, left ventricular mass of 79.3 grams/m2, left ventricular outflow tract diameter of 2.2 cm, stroke volume of 39.9 ml, end diastolic volume (MOD-bp) of 128.5 ml, ejection fraction (MOD-bp) of 31.1%, cardiac output (LVOT) of 4.9 l/min, stroke volume (LVOT) of 57.3 cc, TAPSE of 2.2 cm, and RV S’ velocity of 11.5 cm/sec). Coronary arteries were angiographically normal. On cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, there was extensive, midwall patchy late gadolinium enhancement consistent with acute myocarditis (Figure 1).A serum blood work revealed a hemoglobin count of 141 g/l with an MCV of 92 fl, a platelet count of , a WBC of  with a differential (neutrophil , lymphocytes , monocytes , eosinophils , and basophils ), a high-sensitivity troponin T of 46 ng/l, an NT-proBNP of 261 ng/l, an ESR of 11 mm/h, and a CRP of 3.2 mg/l. An infectious panel was negative for cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, herpes simplex virus, HIV, mumps, toxoplasmosis, and varicella.Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy was performed. This demonstrated features typical of GCM, including extensive myocyte damage, multinucleated giant cells, and mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. There was no granuloma formation (Figure 2). Autoimmune and connective tissue disease serology was unremarkable (negative anti-nuclear antibody, glomerular basement membrane antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, myeloperoxidase antibody, proteinase 3 antibody, and lymphotoxic antibody screening). Anti-heart autoantibodies were not tested on the patient and may be a limitation in the diagnosis of GCM.The patient was treated with standard heart failure therapy including a beta-blocker, angiotensin receptor inhibitor, and mineral corticoid receptor antagonist. Once the diagnosis of GCM was confirmed, a combined immunosuppressive therapy with high-dose prednisone (60 mg daily), tacrolimus (alternating doses of 1 mg and 2 mg daily), and mycophenolate mofetil (1000 mg BID) was added. She also underwent implantation of a secondary prevention dual chamber ICD. In total, the diagnosis of GCM was established within 8 days of presentation, immunosuppressive therapy prescribed on day 9, and ICD implanted on day 14. Total hospital stay was 16 days, and there was no recurrence of VA or heart failure progression. She was discharged in stable condition and remained NYHA II at her follow-up appointments. Her echocardiogram at 6 and 12 months is unchanged with severe LV systolic dysfunction with minor regional variability and mild RV dysfunction. Repeat biopsy performed at 6 months demonstrated interstitial fibrosis and myocyte hypertrophy. Currently, our patient remains on her current immunosuppressive therapies aside from a tapering of her steroid dose to 5 mg daily.Idiopathic giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is presumed to be a T lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory disorder. An association with other autoimmune disorders such as thyroiditis and myasthenia gravis has been reported; however, it was found only among 20% of patients in a larger contemporary case series [2]. GCM affects men and women equally, with a mean age of onset of 42.6 years reported in the multicenter GCM study registry [2]. Common presentation includes heart failure and VA; however, it can also present as an acute myocardial infarction mimic or atrioventricular block [4].Many cases are clinically diagnosed as idiopathic cardiomyopathy until autopsy or cardiac transplantation confirms GCM by histopathology [4]. Differential diagnosis includes sarcoidosis, but granulomata formation, which is absent in GCM, differentiates the two diseases. Repeated endomyocardial biopsy may be necessary to diagnose GCM, with higher sensitivity early in the disease process and in more fulminant cases with more extensive myocardial involvement [4, 5]. EMB has a reported sensitivity of 80% with a positive predictive value of 71% that increases with repeat biopsy [5]. Right ventricular septum was noted to be the target in most cases for myocardial sampling [4]. Imaging modalities such as echocardiography reveal reduced LV function and dilation. Contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI typically reveals areas of late gadolinium enhancement (scar) and increased T2-weighted signal (myocardial edema). 18FDG-PET shows the areas of perfusion defects and inflammation and may be utilized to target biopsies to the sites of active inflammation [4].Prognosis is poor with a median survival of 3 months in the absence of treatment. Sole corticosteroid use was associated with an improved survival of 3.8 months. Combined immunosuppression may be more effective than corticosteroids alone with a median survival of 11.5 months with steroids plus azathioprine and 12.6 months with cyclosporine [2, 4]. GCM is known to recur in transplanted hearts with infiltrates identified on biopsy at a mean of 3 years posttransplant [2, 6]. There are limited data to guide long-term treatment strategies; however, it may be necessary to continue immunosuppression indefinitely due a relapse risk described even eight years after initial diagnosis [7]. Idiopathic GCM is an organ-specific autoimmune disease thought to be due to autoimmunity to myosin, thus necessitating an individualized immunosuppressive regimen with most cases requiring lifelong therapy.Although seemingly effective, combined immunosuppression achieves partial clinical remission in only two-thirds of patients and EMB frequently shows ongoing inflammation. The lack of complete remission suggests the pathophysiology, and optimal treatment is not fully understood [3, 4, 8]. GCM recurrences have even been reported among patients who underwent heart transplantation [4, 9]. Despite medical therapy, sustained VA is present in up to 50% of patients and ICD implantation is recommended [2, 4].Experimental models have suggested that there may be two forms of giant cell myocarditis with macrophage-derived giant cells and with myocyte-derived giant cells with the appearance of multinucleated giant cells corresponding to the fulminant phase of inflammation and myocardial damage [10]. Diagnosis is typically made via endomyocardial biopsy. Combined immunosuppressive therapy, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and guideline-based heart failure therapies improve the overall prognosis; however, more research is needed to better understand this complex disease.The patient has agreed and provided consent for this case report.The authors do not report any conflicts of interest.All authors participated in the care of this patient and contributed in the preparation of the figures and manuscript.
A Rare Case of Pericardial Effusion in a Patient with Silicosis
Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tenyokai Central Hospital and Central Clinic, Kagoshima, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Kosuke Saku; pj.oc.oohay@ekusok_ukasReceived 26 February 2019; Accepted 15 May 2019; Published 9 June 2019Academic Editor: Ming-Ren ChenCopyright © 2019 Kosuke Saku et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Silicosis is an occupational lung disorder caused by inhalation of silica dust. It not only causes respiratory disorders but also affects other organs. We report an extremely rare case of silicosis complicated by pericarditis in an 83-year-old male. He had been working as a coal miner and was diagnosed with silicosis at the age of 63. Because he had experienced repeated pericardial effusions, he was referred for a surgical pericardial biopsy to elucidate the cause of his repeated pericardial effusion and to perform pericardial fenestration. Thoracoscopic surgery was performed. The pericardium was resected, and a drain was placed in the left thoracic cavity. Histopathological examination revealed the pericardial degeneration due to silicosis, suggesting that pericarditis and pericardial effusion are related to silicosis. The operation was successful, and he experienced no recurrence of pericardial effusion at the 7-month follow-up.Silicosis is an irreversible and incurable lung disease caused by inhalation of dust containing crystalline silica particles [1] and is one of the most important occupational diseases in the world [1, 2]. Occupations such as mining, stone work, and sandblasting are associated with an increased risk of silicosis in individuals [2]. Silicosis is a form of pneumoconiosis and can be associated with lung cancer and disorders of other organs [3]. Here, we report an extremely rare case of silicosis complicated by pericarditis and pericardial effusion.The patient was an 83-year-old male who had been working as a coal miner and was diagnosed with silicosis at another hospital at the age of 63. He had experienced repeated pericardial effusions 5 years ago and had undergone pericardiocentesis twice; however, the cause of pericardial effusion remained unclear, and he was referred to our hospital for surgical pericardial biopsy and pericardial fenestration.He presented with general fatigue and exhibited stable vital signs. Fine crackles were heard during inspiration, and a restrictive pattern was observed on pulmonary function testing (vital capacity 2040 mL (71% predicted) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s 1550 mL (81.2% predicted)). We noted peripheral vein swelling and mild limb edema. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 4900/μL, hemoglobin levels of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of , and C-reactive protein levels of 0.06 mg/dL. No obvious liver or renal insufficiency (aminotransferase levels of 17 U/I, alanine transaminase levels of 6 U/I, total bilirubin levels of 0.2 mg/dL, total protein levels of 6.6 g/dL, albumin levels of 3.9 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen levels of 30.3 mg/dL, and creatinine levels of 0.8 mg/dL) was detected. His brain natriuretic peptide levels were 104.0 pg/mL. Low QRS voltage was observed on electrocardiography. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly; his cardiothoracic ratio was 61.0% (Figure 1(a)). Opaque nodules measuring ~30 mm were observed bilaterally in the upper lung, and diffuse, small nodules were observed throughout the lung field and hilar region (Figure 1(a)). Transthoracic echocardiography and chest computed tomography both revealed massive pericardial effusion (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)). Additional findings on echocardiography included not only a right atrium collapse but also a hyperechoic pericardium and pericardial thickening (Figure 1(b)). In addition, there were no significant valvular disease and signs of heart failure (ejection fraction value of 84.0%, left ventricular end diastolic/systolic diameter of 39/18 mm, inferior vena cava diameter during inspiration of 18 mm, right ventricular systolic pressure of 29 mmHg, and  value of 15.1). The patient was referred for a surgical pericardial biopsy to elucidate the cause of his repeated pericardial effusion and to perform pericardial fenestration.Thoracoscopic surgery was performed using a 3 cm incision through the 8th intercostal space. Thoracoscopic examination again revealed serous pleural effusion and multiple nodular opacities throughout the pleura and pericardium (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). A small incision was made on the pericardium (Figure 2(b)), taking care to preserve the left phrenic nerve, through which approximately 1200 mL of the effusion fluid was drained. We resected the pericardium largely of a  section using the Harmonic Scalpel® (Ethicon, US) and placed a drain in the left thoracic cavity.Cytological examination of the pericardial biopsy sample was unremarkable; however, histopathological examination revealed inflammatory cell (mainly lymphocytes) infiltration and hyalinized fibrosis within the nodular tissue (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)), consistent with a diagnosis of silicosis. Lastly, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results were negative for tuberculosis.The patient’s fatigue was resolved after surgery, and he experienced no recurrence of pericardial effusion at the 7-month follow-up.Silicosis is a well-known occupational respiratory disease [1], which causes lung inflammation and fibrosis. Silicosis is caused by inhalation and deposition of large amounts of crystalline silica over time [4]. Although protective measures such as dust control and respirators have reduced deaths attributable to silicosis in developed countries, new outbreaks still occur [5].When silica dust is inhaled, the particles deposit within the distal airways. Macrophages ingest these particles and initiate an inflammatory response by releasing proinflammatory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and other cytokines. These often lead to tissue fibrosis and formation of nodular lesions [5]. Thus, silicosis is characterized by fibrotic nodules with concentrically arranged collagen fibers, central hyalinization, and fibrotic lesions [5]. In our case, white nodules were showed on the pericardial surface, and inflammatory cell infiltration and hyalinized fibrosis within the nodular tissue were found by the histopathological examination. It was diagnosed as silicosis nodules.Although the deposition of silica is common in lung tissues, it can also accumulate in other organs like the brain, peritoneum, bone marrow, liver, and spleen [6]. Our patient presented with an extremely rare condition as silica affected the pericardium on evoking a chronic inflammatory response; these processes could be involved in pericarditis and recurrent pericardial effusion.There are a few reports on silica involved in pericardial degeneration [2, 6]. Jiang and Shao reported a male stone miner patient having both silicosis and constrictive pericarditis [2]. Mohebbi et al. reported a pericardial plague seen in a patient with silicosis and pathology findings of the pericardial specimen which had a typical basket-weave collagen pattern suggesting silica deposits [6]. The mechanisms through which silica causes pericarditis are unclear; however, one potential cause is immune reactions [2]. Individuals with silicosis manifest a significantly increased risk for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, progressive systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ANCA-associated small vessel vasculitis, and Wegener’s granulomatosis [7]. It was considered that silica deposits broke the immune homeostasis [2, 7]. In addition, silica which has the nondegradable nature leads to saturation of the macrophages, and it has been demonstrated that macrophages that ingest silica release factors that increase biosynthesis by fibroblasts [7, 8]. Zeren et al. have reported that lymphatic and venous spread of the dust is thought to be responsible for extrapulmonary disease, because silica particles cannot be destroyed with phagocytosis and enzymatic reactions [3]. These immune responses may have affected not only the lungs but also the pericardium in our case. Another possibility is unrelated, yet concurrent, infections leading to pericarditis [2]. Exposure to silica dust is a potent risk factor for tuberculosis, as demonstrated by multiple studies [9]. However, the PCR result for tuberculosis was negative in our patient.Because pericardial fenestration provides continuous drainage into the pulmonary cavity, absorption from the pleura is expected [10]. Consequently, pericardial fenestration carries a lower risk of pericardial effusion recurrence than temporary drainage methods like pericardiocentesis. A previous study has described that pericardial fenestration or pericardial biopsy via thoracoscopy is a safe and minimally invasive technique [10] and that the thoracoscopy approach can excise a larger window of the pericardium to prevent a recurrent effusion [10]. Our patient also achieved good outcomes following pericardial fenestration via thoracoscopy.This case report has some limitations. (1) Although histopathological examination has revealed that the degeneration of the pericardium is due to silicosis, the silica itself has not been identified from the pericardium. In addition, histopathological examination revealed chronic inflammatory cell (mainly lymphocytes) infiltration and hyalinized fibrosis within the nodular tissue, and it was diagnosed as a consistent finding as silicosis nodules. (2) The mechanisms through which silica causes pericarditis are still unclear. Further studies are needed in the future.We reported an extremely rare case of silicosis complicated by pericarditis and pericardial effusion. The precise mechanisms through which silica deposits affect the pericardium are unclear; however, pericarditis and pericardial effusion could be the products of immune reactions induced by silica and/or translocation of silica dust via lung tissue. Although the pathological condition in which silicosis is involved in pericarditis as this case is very rare, we should be aware of such a pathological condition in the clinical practice.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Concurrent Negative-Pressure Pulmonary Edema (NPPE) and Takotsubo Syndrome (TTS) after Upper Airway Obstruction
1University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA2Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Evan Harmon; ude.ainigriv@nomraheReceived 31 December 2018; Revised 15 April 2019; Accepted 27 May 2019; Published 9 June 2019Academic Editor: Manabu ShirotaniCopyright © 2019 Evan Harmon et al.

One important complication of acute obstruction is negative-pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE). We describe two cases of acute upper airway obstruction, both of which resulted in flash pulmonary edema complicated by acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Though NPPE was suspected, these patients were also found to have Takotsubo syndrome (TTS). Neither patient had prior cardiac disease, and both subsequently had a negative ischemic workup. Because TTS is a condition triggered by hyperadrenergic states, the acute airway obstruction alone or in combination with NPPE was the likely explanation for TTS in each case. These cases highlight the importance of also considering cardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema in the setting of upper airway obstruction, which we suspect generates a profound catecholamine surge and places patients at increased risk of TTS development.NPPE is a rare but well-described complication of upper airway obstruction and has been of particular interest to clinicians and researchers alike as it represents one of the few noncardiogenic causes of flash pulmonary edema. However, acute obstruction may also place patients at higher risk of cardiac complications which can cause or exacerbate pulmonary edema. One such complication is the development of Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), which is underdiagnosed, particularly in the perioperative and critical care settings, given that it is commonly mistaken for an acute coronary syndrome with subsequent ischemic cardiomyopathy. Though both NPPE and TTS individually have been well-described, there is a paucity of reports describing the sudden, concurrent development of both NPPE and TTS in patients suffering acute upper airway obstruction.A 39-year-old woman with a history of borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, and depression presented to the emergency department (ED) intubated after a suicide attempt by hanging. Her partner at the bedside estimated the patient had been hanging for roughly ten minutes prior to being discovered and also suspected concurrent overdose on home alprazolam. Admission vital signs and exam were remarkable for HR 112 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, pupils 6 mm and reactive to light, GCS 3, and neck erythema.The initial laboratory workup was notable for white blood cell (WBC) count 18.6 K/μL, troponin 0.24 ng/mL (peak of 1.78 ng/mL), and arterial blood gas (ABG) on FiO2 100% demonstrating pH 7.201, pCO2 36 mmHg, pO2 231.6 mmHg, bicarbonate 13.8 mmol/L, anion gap 8 mmol/L, and lactate 0.86 mmol/L. Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave changes. Trauma imaging in the ED included contrasted tomography (CT) of the head without contrast, CT cervical spine, and CT angiography of the neck, which were negative for cervical spine injury, cervical artery dissection, or brain hemorrhage or infarct. However, chest X-ray (CXR) demonstrated diffuse, bilateral pulmonary edema (Figure 1). The patient was also found to be hypotensive and required vasopressor support. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management of NPPE complicated by acute hypoxic respiratory failure, severe nonanion gap metabolic acidosis, and presumed type II non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).Shortly after arrival to the ICU, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was obtained which demonstrated a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) 40-45% and LV wall-motion abnormality consistent with midventricular form of Takotsubo syndrome (TTS, Figure 2). Intravenous diuresis with furosemide was administered with satisfactory response. Additionally, the patient’s metabolic derangements corrected with supportive measures, sedation and vasopressor support were weaned, and she was successfully extubated within 48 hours of admission without any adverse neurologic sequelae. She was successfully started on metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily with goal conversion to succinate formulation and uptitration to therapeutic effect as hemodynamically tolerated. The patient was transferred for continued inpatient psychiatric evaluation and management. Follow-up echocardiogram three months after initial TTE demonstrated full recovery of LV function.A 64-year-old man without history of cardiac disease was admitted for debridement of anterior mandibular osteomyelitis. Preoperative cardiopulmonary assessment was unremarkable, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Shortly after extubation, he unexpectedly demonstrated labored breathing with inspiratory stridor. Laryngospasm was visualized by direct laryngoscopy, and the patient ultimately required reintubation. Appropriate endotracheal tube placement was confirmed by chest rise and CO2 monitor, yet the patient was found to have oxygen saturation of 90% on 100% FiO2. He subsequently became severely hypotensive requiring vasopressor support and ICU admission.Upon arrival, pulmonary auscultation revealed bilateral rales, and frothy secretions were suctioned via the endotracheal tube. The initial workup was most significant for troponin elevated to 1.76 ng/mL (), electrocardiogram with new, diffuse, deep T-wave inversions, CXR demonstrating flash pulmonary edema, and bedside TTE demonstrating severely reduced LVEF of 20% with diffuse akinesis involving the mid-to-apical segments of the LV with basal sparing. Right ventricular function was normal. Coronary angiogram was negative for acute coronary syndrome or any significant obstructive coronary artery disease.These findings suggested TTS as the etiology of patient’s acute cardiogenic shock. He responded well to intravenous diuretic therapy and was successfully extubated and weaned from all inotropic/vasopressor support within five days of ICU admission. This clinical improvement corresponded with radiographic resolution of his pulmonary edema. Seven days after initial presentation, repeat TTE demonstrated EF improvement to greater than 40% with distal anteroseptal periapical and distal inferoseptal hypokinesis and akinesis. At ambulatory follow-up appointment two months after hospital discharge, he was found to be asymptomatic with ECG normalization.Negative-pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE) is an increasingly described life-threatening emergency in the perioperative and critical care settings. Upper airway obstruction is the fundamental etiology of this phenomenon, with upper airway infection, tumor, and laryngospasm thought to be the most common causes [1]. Though a myriad of etiologies have been associated with NPPE since first reported in the pediatric literature over forty years ago [2], a unifying pathophysiological process has been elusive to date. Overall, it is thought that inspiratory effort against an obstructed glottis results in increased hydrostatic forces in the pulmonary microvasculature. This disruption of Starling forces, combined with profoundly negative intrathoracic airway pressures, results in fluid extravasation into the interstitium and subsequent flash pulmonary edema.However, we describe two cases of NPPE, one due to asphyxiation and the other laryngospasm, which were further complicated by Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), an acute heart failure syndrome typically affecting women over the age of 50. It is characterized by apical or midventricular LV dysfunction with new ECG and/or serum cardiac biomarker abnormalities but without obstructive coronary disease and/or plaque rupture by coronary angiography [3]. To our knowledge, these cases represent two of only four total reports of concurrent NPPE and TTS [4, 5]. A number of pathophysiologic mechanisms of TTS have been proposed which typically revolve around a sudden and profound catecholamine release, including catecholamine-induced multivessel epicardial spasm and cyclic AMP-mediated intracellular calcium overload [6, 7]. Each of these mechanisms directly induce myocyte injury, though the role of the former in TTS propagation may be less relevant given that TTS may be precipitated by direct beta-agonism. Specifically, increasing evidence suggests elevated levels of peripheral epinephrine alter β2-adrenergic receptor signaling by inducing a switch from stimulatory to inhibitory G protein subcellular signaling [8].It is precisely this catecholaminergic surge which we suspect serves as the pathophysiologic link between NPPE and TTS (Figure 3). Attempted inhalation against a fixed obstruction in the form of a closed glottis results in both negative intrathoracic pressure and what is likely a dramatic catecholaminergic surge. This hyperadrenergic state not only contributes to both direct and indirect myocyte injuries as previously described but also results in peripheral vasoconstriction which serves to increase both preload and afterload. A sudden increase in right ventricular preload has two primary effects: first, pulmonary vasculature volume increases, contributing to increased hydrostatic forces. Second, greater venous return to the RV may result in septal bowing with resultant LV outflow tract obstruction, thereby diminishing LV EF. Additionally, elevated peripheral sympathetic activity results in arterial vasoconstriction, and this increased afterload places undue strain on the LV. Finally, negative intrathoracic airway pressure itself has been demonstrated to increase LV transmural pressure, further diminishing LV function.Thus, upper airway obstruction may compromise LV function by at least four mechanisms: increased RV preload with resultant septal bowing, increased afterload via catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction, increased LV transmural pressure via the sudden generation of negative intrathoracic pressure, and rarely, as in the cases reported here, catecholamine-induced cardiomyocyte damage resulting in TTS. It should also be noted that increasing evidence has implicated the shedding of endovascular glycocalyx, an important regulator of vascular permeability, as a critical pathophysiologic mechanism at the cellular level by which TTS may induce pulmonary edema [10]. The summative effect of these physiologic insults is almost certain to be cardiogenic shock, which worsens pulmonary vasculature congestion and exacerbates NPPE. The final pathway of these processes is flash pulmonary edema with acute respiratory distress and often failure, which is accompanied by further catecholamine production, promoting a complex, life-threatening pathophysiologic cycle.Therefore, flash pulmonary edema complicated by acute hypoxic respiratory failure encountered in the setting of upper airway obstruction may be due to both noncardiogenic and cardiogenic factors. This is especially important to remember in the perioperative period, when cardiac dysfunction due to TTS may be misattributed to infarction. We recommend emergent cardiac evaluation including troponin, ECG, and bedside TTE. In patients with troponinemia, newly reduced or worsened EF, wall-motion abnormalities, and/or ischemic changes on ECG, a more invasive workup including coronary angiogram should be considered. A profound elevation in BNP or NT-proBNP disproportionate to troponin elevation may also serve as an indicator of TTS rather than evolving myocardial infarction. If no ischemic etiology is identified, diagnosis may ultimately be confirmed by the visualization of diffuse, nonlocalizing ventricular edema on cardiac MRI. Management should focus on intravenous diuresis, positive-pressure ventilation, and hemodynamic support. Future research should determine what prognostic significance, if any, should be ascribed to the concurrent development of NPPE with TTS in patients with acute upper airway obstruction. Anecdotal evidence derived from the cases presented here and those reported elsewhere suggests that full recovery of LVEF can be expected with proper management, though the aforementioned pathophysiologic changes in LV structure may persist.NPPE is a relatively rare but well-described life-threatening complication of upper airway obstruction. However, TTS is one of multiple cardiogenic etiologies which may also be contributing to flash pulmonary edema in this patient population. Though the precise mechanisms by which each of these pathologies occur have not been delineated, we suspect upper airway obstruction alone or in combination with NPPE generates a profound catecholamine surge which may be a key in triggering TTS. In select patients, ischemic evaluation may be warranted. Despite rapid and dramatic cardiopulmonary compromise, these patients appear to quickly achieve full recovery with proper management, though further research is necessary to definitively determine long-term prognosis.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Mitral Valve Endocarditis with Perforation from a Urinary Source: An Unusual Case and Literature Review
Oakland University Beaumont Hospital, West 13 Mile Road, Royal Oak, MI 48073, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Fernando Figueroa Rodriguez; gro.tnomuaeb@zeugirdoraoreugif.odnanrefReceived 9 March 2019; Accepted 23 May 2019; Published 9 June 2019Academic Editor: Ertugrul ErcanCopyright © 2019 Fernando Figueroa Rodriguez et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Aerococcus urinae (AU) is a rare pathogen, identified as gram-positive, catalase-negative coccus that grows in pairs and clusters which has been reported to mainly cause urinary tract infections (UTI), especially in elderly males. Treatment for this microorganism is usually with beta-lactams although cultures with antibiotic susceptibility testing are imperative. We present a case of AU endocarditis initially treated with IV antibiotics; nevertheless, the patient required emergent mitral valve replacement due to severe mitral insufficiency and perforation. We also present an analysis with high-yield points summarizing epidemiology, risk factors, microbiology, clinical features, diagnostic workup, and management of AU in general and AU endocarditis. Finally, we post a literature review of relevant cases and the impact of different variables associated with it.A 55-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented with a one-week history of nonproductive cough, dyspnea at rest, dysuria, and urinary frequency and urgency. He was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and a viral upper respiratory tract infection by his primary care physician two days prior and was prescribed ciprofloxacin. His symptoms did not improve so he decided to go to the emergency department (ED). Upon presentation, his oxygen saturation was noted to be 90%, with tachycardia and a low-grade fever. On exam, he had significant bibasilar crackles as well as a holosystolic apical murmur; additionally, he was found to have 2+ lower extremity edema and several punctuate macular lesions on his feet, highly suspicious for vascular emboli phenomena (Figure 1). His laboratory studies demonstrated leukocytosis with neutrophilia (14.7 bil/L and 11.3 bil/L, respectively) and evidence of acute kidney injury. The urinalysis bacteriuria and leukocytes. A chest X-ray (CXR) was unremarkable. Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and he was empirically started on ceftriaxone. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a mobile mass on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve consistent with a vegetation. Ejection fraction was calculated to be 40% (Figure 2). Preliminary blood cultures reported gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. At day 3, AU was identified as the pathogen in both, blood and urine, cultures. The patient was then started on intravenous gentamicin and penicillin G with plans for a 6-week therapy. He was medically treated for acute heart failure with aggressive diuresis. At day 5, the patient received a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which confirmed a “” vegetation attached to the posterior leaflet of mitral valve (Figure 3(a)), with severe mitral regurgitation and posterior leaflet perforation (Figure 3(b)). On day 8, the patient was acutely decompensated, and he was endotracheally intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and consequently underwent emergent prosthetic mitral valve replacement. He had a prolonged complicated postoperative period requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and hemodialysis. Repeat blood cultures showed resolution of AU bacteremia. Finally, after 3 months, the patient was discharged to a subacute rehabilitation unit.AU is a rare pathogen, first isolated in 1953 found in lobsters and thought to be of no clinical significance. It was until 1967 when it was first described to cause infection in humans [1]. This organism is a gram-positive, catalase-negative growing coccus in clusters that belongs to a bacterial group referred to as Aerococcus-like organisms (ALO) [2]. It has been associated with UTI mainly, nevertheless there are reports that identify it as the culprit of blood stream infections and endocarditis. Due to difficulties in the biochemical identification, the incidence of infections with this microorganism has likely been underestimated. Currently, it is thought to be the cause of 0.15 to 0.54% of UTIs [1]; additionally, it is responsible for 0.03 to 0.05% of blood stream infections (BSI). There is not enough data regarding the incidence of AU endocarditis as there have been only 45 reports in English literature. Advanced age (>65 years) and underlying urologic conditions are the best-known risk factors for UTI and, potentially, BSI [3] and endocarditis. Both sexes are equally affected [4, 5].The diagnosis is usually challenging due to the rarity of this pathogen. It is commonly mistaken with Staphylococcus sp. and even Streptococcus viridians; for this reason, molecular diagnostic techniques are often needed to identify it. Testing for leucine aminopeptidase, which is positive only for AU, can be used to differentiate it with Staphylococcus [6]. Secure identification also relies on genetic techniques like 16S ribosomal subunit sequencing or mass spectroscopic methods such as MALDI-TOF [7]. To date, there are no guidelines that recommend starting with any of these modalities, even in the presence of the above risk factors, as they are nonspecific, so the diagnostic algorithms remain the same as for the rest of the pathogens.Due to the current lack of controlled scientific trials and lack of formalized treatment guidelines, therapy is often empiric and guided by expert opinion. In an effort to standardize a treatment, Yabes et al. in 2018 [8] compiled the reported cases and therapies in literature and found that treatment regimens for AU have largely relied on beta-lactams, with the possible addition of synergistic aminoglycosides for endocarditis. In vitro studies regarding the antibiotic susceptibilities of AU have shown susceptibility to amoxicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, doxycycline, linezolid, meropenem, penicillin, rifampin, and vancomycin. It had variable resistance to clindamycin, erythromycin, and levofloxacin [9–11]. It is, however, inherently resistant to sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones [10]. The duration of treatment vary from ten days for UTI and phlegmon to 14 to 28 days for BSI and 42 days (6 weeks) for endocarditis [8]. It is important to mention that treatment for the latter very commonly includes surgical intervention as well, but indications are the same as for other etiologies.Overall mortality of AU infections, including UTI and BSI, has been shown to be equivalent to that of other etiologies. For endocarditis in particular, a higher rate of complications and mortality has been described, with 27% more when compared to other causes. It is thought that this could be associated with an older patient population with multiple other comorbidities, making their surgical profile highly unfavorable, and dependent on medical management only [8].Between 2000 and 2012, the incidence of endocarditis in the United States increased from 11 per 100,000 population to 15 per 100,000 population [12, 13]. Nowadays, the precise incidence is difficult to ascertain because case definitions have varied over time between authors and between clinical centers. In addition, the presence of predisposing conditions such as rheumatic heart disease or injection drug use is variable over time and between regions and in low- and high-income countries [14, 15].A literature search on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases revealed 45 cases of AU endocarditis in English literature (Table 1). We present a summary with a mathematical analysis and calculations involving all reports in an effort to identify patterns regarding risk factors, clinical course, treatment modalities, and prognosis.The general statistics are as follows:
(i)85% (39) of the patients were male and only 15% female (7)(ii)The average age was 72 years, with the youngest patient being 42 years and the oldest 91 years (2)(iii)Of the forty patients, only three had no reported associated risk factors or comorbidities (6.5%), 93.5% did have risk factors which are as follows:
(a)69% of the patients had urologic comorbidities while only four patients (9.5%) had an underlying known cardiac condition (one patient with aortic stenosis, one patient with atrial septal defect, and one patient with pacemaker(b)Five patients were also reported to have a nonurologic associated malignancy (11.9%)(c)Only two patients (4.6%) had a different risk factor other than the ones mentioned above, a case with untreated hepatitis C and other case with liver failure (2.3% each)(iv)Regarding urologic risk factors:
(a)Current or recent presence of indwelling urinary catheter was seen in eight patients (19%), benign prostatic hypertrophy was also seen in eight patients (19%)(b)Recurrent UTIs were seen in three patients (6.9%), same goes for urethral strictures (three patients—6.9%)(c)History of cystoscopy was found in two patients (4.6%), phimosis was also reported in two patients only (4.6%)(d)Transurethral resection of the prostate, ureteral stent, and suprapubic catheter were seen with one patient each (2.3% per patient)(v)In terms of affected valve: 43.4% (20 patients) had involvement of the mitral valve and the same percentage for aortic valve. One patient, 2.3%, had both valves affected; one patient had aortic and tricuspid valves affected. Finally, one patient (2.3%) had a pacemaker. Affected valves were not reported in 3 patients (6.5%)(vi)For surgical intervention, in 20 cases, it was not reported whether the patient had surgery or not; for the 26 cases, that it was. Statistics are as follows:
(a)14 patients (53.8%) did not have cardiac valve surgery(b)12 patients (46.2%) did have cardiac valve surgery(c)80% of the patients that received surgery survived(vii)Regarding antibiotic treatment: 98% of the patients received antibiotics. In one patient (2%), treatment was not reported
(a)In 100% of the cases, a beta-lactam was used
(1)In 5 patients (11.1%), it was used as a single therapy(2)In the rest of the patients (91%), it was used in combination: in 38 patients (83%), it was combined with an aminoglycoside; in 2 patients (4.5%), it was used along vancomycin; and in 1 patient (2.2%), it was used in combination with aminoglycoside and rifampin(b)In patients that survived, the duration of beta-lactam ranged from 2 to 12 weeks; meanwhile, aminoglycoside ranged from 1 to 6 weeks. Vancomycin was used for 2 weeks in 1 patient (in the other one duration was not reported), and finally rifampin was used for 6 weeksThe mortality statistics are as follows:
(i)Overall mortality was 28.2% (13 patients)
(a)92.3% (12) were male and only 1 female(b)84.6% (11) were over 50 years old (average age: 71 years)(ii)In terms of risk factors:
(a)69.2% (9) had an underlying urologic condition(b)1 patient (7.6%) had underlying aortic stenosis, and 1 patient (7.6%) had nonurologic malignancy(c)In 2 patients, the underlying comorbidities were not reported(iii)Most patients that eventually died did not undergo surgical intervention, only 2 patients (15%) had it(iv)Regarding affected valve:
(a)46.8% (6 patients) had aortic valve endocarditis(b)38.4% (5 patients) had mitral valve endocarditis(c)1 patient (7.6%) had both aortic and tricuspid involvement(d)In 1 patient (7.6%), the affected valve was not reportedAs seen in previous reports, most of the patients were elderly males. The majority had underlying urologic comorbidities; baseline cardiac anomalies like valvular diseases were very seldom seen. Additionally, mitral and aortic valves were equally affected.All of the patients received treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics. In most of them, aminoglycosides were used in combination; other less commonly used add-on therapies were vancomycin and rifampin. More than half of the patients did not undergo surgery, as they were deemed as poor surgical candidates or did not meet criteria for intervention. Interestingly enough, 100% of the patients that received beta-lactam as monotherapy in combination with surgery survived.Aerococcus urinae endocarditis is associated with a 28% mortality from our calculations, deeming a high grade of aggressiveness to this microorganism. It is unclear at this time if this high mortality is due to the bacteria itself or the fact that most of the patients were elderly and had other comorbidities. Lack of surgical intervention in most patients possibly plays a role as 80% of the patients that underwent a surgical procedure survived. An underlying urologic condition was commonly seen in the patients that died, although it was recurrently seen in patients that survived as well. The affected valve does not seem to have an impact on mortality.AU is an extremely unusual cause of human disease; it has been described to cause urinary tract infections, blood stream infections, and infective endocarditis. We do believe, however, that its actual incidence is higher than reported. Reliable data regarding clinical presentation, diagnosis, and potential treatments of AU are becoming more available to health-care workers making this a promising era in its management. With this case report and literature review, we aim to add critical data to the current medical literature regarding this rare pathogen. We urge health-care professionals to share related experiences in order to build up literature and treat patients in a more appropriate manner; at this time evidently, randomized studies are univariably defiant as with any rare disorder.The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest

The etiology of TTS is still uncertain but may be associated with catecholamine elevations during times of emotional or physical stress. Catecholamines are also understood to have prothrombotic properties, which could lead to ACS. With these similarities, differentiating these two pathologies can be difficult, especially when TTS and ACS occur simultaneously.The pathogenesis of takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is not completely understood. Proposed mechanisms involve catecholamine excess during times of physical or emotional stress that lead to left ventricular myocardial dysfunction by direct catecholamine-associated toxicity and microvascular spasm [1, 2]. Although TTS may sometimes present as an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), angiography typically reveals no occlusive lesion within the coronary arteries. We present a case of a postmenopausal Caucasian female with TTS and coexisting critical stenosis of the right coronary artery (RCA).A previously healthy 89-year-old female presented to the emergency department complaining of midsternal chest discomfort that radiated to her back. Her chest discomfort began the day prior to presentation, but she initially attributed it to indigestion and thus waited to seek medical attention. Her chest pain persisted however, which prompted her to seek evaluation in the emergency department. Upon arrival, she was given aspirin with resolution of her symptoms. Laboratory analysis revealed an elevated troponin I level of 0.319 and initial creatine kinase (CK) of 12.7. Brain natriuretic peptide level on presentation was not checked. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was notable for diffuse T-wave inversions demonstrating inferior, as well as anterolateral ischemia, and a prolonged QTc of 503 ms (Figure 1). Echocardiogram demonstrated moderate left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction of 35%-40%) with mid to distal anteroseptal, anterolateral, and apical akinesis (Figure 2). The patient was taken to the catheterization suite and underwent emergent left heart catheterization. Angiography revealed 90% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery (RCA) which was believed to be the culprit lesion. There were no significant obstructive lesions noted in the left anterior descending or left circumflex arteries. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with successful stent placement to the RCA (Figure 3). She was then started on appropriate guideline-directed medical therapy and observed in the intensive care unit where her chest pain resolved. Repeat laboratory analysis revealed that CK had decreased to 6.4. ECG obtained following PCI revealed interval improvement of the inferior T-wave inversions, with sustained T-wave abnormalities in the anterolateral leads (Figure 4). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not available at our facility and was not performed. The remainder of her hospitalization proceeded without incident, and she was discharged home in stable condition three days later.The patient was evaluated two weeks after discharge in an outpatient clinic and was feeling well. She again denied any stressors prior to the onset of pain but reported that the development of chest pain caused her a great deal of emotional distress. Repeat echocardiogram was obtained which revealed normal left ventricular systolic function (Figure 5).There have been numerous case reports of patients presenting with profound left ventricular dysfunction after suffering severe emotional or physical stress. This syndrome was first described in Japan in 1990 and is commonly referred to as transient apical ballooning syndrome or takotsubo syndrome [3–8]. Takotsubo syndrome is often associated with emotional triggers but has frequently been described in association with physical triggers. A large registry of patients with TTS found that physical triggers were more common than emotional triggers—women were more likely to have emotional triggers whereas men were more likely to have a physical trigger [9]. Although the diagnosis of TTS has historically been based on the presence of angiographically normal coronary arteries, there have been multiple reports of TTS occurring in the setting of physiological stress from acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [10]. The prevalence of TTS is estimated to be 2%-3% in patients who present with ACS and may be underestimated in individuals with coexisting coronary artery disease [11]. The recently updated International Takotsubo Diagnostic Criteria (InterTAK Diagnostic Criteria) specifically states that “significant coronary artery disease is not a contraindication in takotsubo syndrome” [1]. The exact pathophysiology of myocardial dysfunction due to sympathetic stimulation is unknown, but numerous mechanisms have been proposed. One potential mechanism is direct myocardial ischemia due to coronary arterial spasm—it has been shown that increased mental stress can cause vasoconstriction in patients without coronary artery disease [12]. Another potential mechanism is sympathetically mediated microvascular dysfunction resulting in abnormal coronary blood flow in the absence of obstructive disease [13]. A third potential mechanism is direct myocyte injury due to increased levels of circulating catecholamines which have been shown to cause contraction band necrosis. Similar injury patterns have been reported with catecholamine excess due to pheochromocytoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage [14, 15].However, recent review suggests that although catecholamine excess may be linked to TTS, there is no direct causality [16].This case poses two interesting questions: is the physiologic and emotional stress of chest pain enough to cause TTS? Can the catecholamine excess from TTS cause ACS? Catecholamines have been demonstrated to have prothrombotic properties in coronary arteries. Lin and Young demonstrated that by raising the plasma epinephrine concentration to approximately 27 nmol/L, the incidence of cyclic blood flow reductions in the coronary arteries of canines increased by 60% [17]. Catecholamine levels in takotsubo patients are 2-3 times higher than myocardial infarction patients 1-2 days after the onset of symptoms and 20 times higher than normal adults [18]. Additionally, the catecholamine levels in takotsubo patients remain elevated over myocardial infarction levels for 7-9 days [19]. With the known prothrombotic properties of catecholamines and the suspected rise in catecholamines associated with TTS, it is possible that TTS could have occurred first in our patient, leading to ACS of the RCA. This could have occurred either by thrombosis in our patient’s native coronary artery or with the acute left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction associated TTS, an embolic event from a LV thrombus. However, extensive review of our patient’s history, cardiac imaging, laboratory findings, and medical record failed to elucidate a possible cause for TTS other than her ACS.Based on her description of symptoms and failure to identify another cause, we hypothesize that she initially developed ACS of the RCA, and the emotional distress from this event is likely the etiology of her TTS. Previous case series have reported that postischemic myocardial stunning has features typical of TTS and suggested that ACS may trigger TTS [20]. It can be difficult to distinguish between TTS and ACS as they have similar clinical presentations, and both can cause transient wall motion abnormalities [21]. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can help distinguish TTS from myocardial infarction when there is diagnostic uncertainty, but unfortunately, we were unable to perform this in our patient [22].The diagnosis of TTS has historically been a diagnosis of exclusion that required the presence of normal coronary arteries, but recent expert consensus has been updated to remove CAD as an exclusion criterion. Previous case reports have described cases of TTS coexisting with ACS as well as cases of ACS triggering TTS. This case contributes to the growing body of case reports that suggest that TTS and ACS can occur concomitantly.Nicholas Mencer, DO, Larry Todd Justice, MD, William Black, MD, and Kayleigh Litton, DO certify that they have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest (such as honoraria; educational grants; participation in speakers’ bureaus; membership, employment, consultancies, stock ownership, or other equity interest; and expert testimony or patent-licensing arrangements) or nonfinancial interest (such as personal or professional relationships, affiliations, knowledge, or beliefs) in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.All authors had access to all data and a role in writing this manuscript.
Noncompaction and Takotsubo Syndrome in a Neuromuscular Disorder

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) in patients with left ventricular hypertrabeculation/noncompaction (LVHT) has been reported in four patients, and a TTS plus LVHT plus a neuromuscular disorder (NMD) was only reported once so far. Here, we present the fifth patient with LVHT and TTS and the second patient with LVHT, TTS, and a NMD. Methods and Results. The patient is a 68 yo female hobby choir singer with a history of skin dermatofibroma, skin fibrokeratoma, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, anemia, hyponatremia, diverticulosis, LVHT detected at age 60 y, five syncopes, a liver cyst, and carotid endarterectomy 2 months prior to admission because of sudden-onset chest pain. Workup revealed ST elevation, troponin elevation, and mild coronary artery sclerosis. Ventriculography and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed the apical type of a TTS. ECG normalised within 10 w and TTE within 6 w under beta-blockers and ATII-blockers. The TTS was triggered by being offended of being unable to sing anymore after endarterectomy. Neurological workup suggested the presence of a NMD. Conclusions. This case shows that LVHT occurs in NMD patients and that patients with LVHT and a NMD may develop a TTS. Whether patients with LVHT and a NMD are particularly prone to develop a TTS requires further confirmation. NMD patients with LVHT should avoid stress not to trigger a TTS.Only few patients with left ventricular hypertrabeculation (LVHT), also known as noncompaction, have been reported who also developed a Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) [1–4]. This unusual combination has been reported in a patient with a Beals-Hecht syndrome [1], a female with myotonic dystrophy type 1 [2], a 76 yo female without other concomitant diseases [3], and in a 12 yo female with low-grade glioma of the cerebellar vermis [4]. Here, we report a fifth patient with LVHT who developed a TTS shortly after carotid endarterectomy.The patient is a 68 yo Caucasian female, height 170 cm, weight 68 kg, with a previous history of smoking (20 pack-years) until age 50 y, arterial hypertension since age 40 y, and resection of a dermatofibroma on the right upper arm and a fibrokeratoma of the 3rd digit of the left foot at age 50 y. The individual history was further positive for struma nodosa and Hashimoto thyroiditis since age 58 y, hyperlipidemia since at least age 58 y, a liver cyst in segments 6/7, diverticulosis of the colon, first detected at age 58 y, and myoma resection. Also, since age 58 y, she temporarily experienced a few panic attacks for which she was hospitalised once at age 60 y. Since age 59 y, she reported a mild sleep disorder. Mild anemia of unknown cause was recognised since age 59 y. Since at least age 59 y, recurrent hyponatremia in the absence of taking diuretics or serotonin reuptake inhibitors was noted. LVHT was first diagnosed at age 60 y and confirmed at age 68 y (Figure 1). Since age 63 y, she experienced recurrent nausea and abdominal pain with a tendency for constipation and flatulence. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy only revealed the known diverticulosis. Workup for secondary arterial hypertension at age 67 y was negative. Parathyroid hormone, renin, aldosterone, and ACTH levels were all in the normal range. There was recurrent transient lymphocytosis, but workup for malignancy was negative. The family history was positive for epilepsy (2nd brother), dementia (2nd brother), migraine (daughter), arterial hypertension (father, mother, and 1st sister), arrhythmias (2nd sister), diabetes (father), tuberculosis with osteomyelitis (1st sister), Graves’ disease (daughter), and coronary heart disease (father and 1st brother). She was a passionate hobby choir singer since years.Workup for two syncopes at age 67 y (the second with secessus urinae) and three syncopes before revealed normal systolic function and confirmed previously diagnosed LVHT on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) had not been carried out so far. Concerning the neurological history, she reported muscle cramps under simvastatin, exercise intolerance, and easy fatigability. Upon the neurological exam, an exaggerated masseter reflex, generally reduced tendon reflexes, and fasciculations of the right adductor pollicis muscle were found. Electroencephalography (EEG), cerebral computed tomography (CCT), and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal, but carotid ultrasound and MR angiography (MRA) revealed a high-grade stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. This is why she underwent carotid endarterectomy of the left internal and common carotid artery. Postoperatively, she experienced recurrent collapses, hypertensive crises, and uncertainty and fear but no further syncope.Two months after surgery, she developed sudden onset thoracic pain. Since ECG showed ST elevation and troponin was elevated, myocardial infarction was suspected. However, acute coronary angiography revealed only mild coronary sclerosis but ventriculography showed the apical type of a TTS (Figure 2), which was confirmed by TTE. Already 6 d after the onset of symptoms, TTE showed almost normal systolic function, mild myocardial thickening, diastolic dysfunction grade 2, and regional apical akinesia/hypokinesia. TTE normalised completely within 6 w and the ECG within 10 w. The presumed trigger of the TTS was being offended of being unable to sing again. The cause of hyponatremia remained speculative. A syndrome of inadequate ADH secretion (SIADH) was excluded, and the patient was asked to salt the food more extensively. She is currently taking acetyl-salicylic acid, bisoprolol, candesartan, rilmenidine, and simvastatin.The patient is interesting for the coincidence of LVHT and a TTS and the presence of a NMD. A coincidence of LVHT and a TTS has been reported only in four patients before [1–4], suggesting that LVHT does not promote the development of a TTS. However, systematic investigations on the question if cardiomyopathy is generally a predisposing factor for the development of a TTS are not available. Thus, it is still conceivable that cardiomyopathy is less resistant to a catecholamine storm than the normal myocardium and that LVHT is nonetheless a risk factor for the development of a TTS.Concerning the notion that LVHT occurs in up to 80% of the patients with a NMD [5], the present case confirms such a relation. The neurological history revealed muscle cramps under simvastatin, exercise intolerance, and easy fatigability, and the neurological exam revealed generally reduced tendon reflexes and fasciculation in the right adductor pollicis muscle, suggesting the presence of a NMD. The type of NMD, however, remained speculative since further workup for a NMD was not feasible. Anyhow, a metabolic NMD is more likely than a structural NMD.LVHT is frequently complicated by ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, or embolism [6]. None of these conditions had been recognised yet in the present patient, but it cannot be excluded that TTS is another, hitherto, not recognised complication of LVHT. In this respect, it is conceivable that already little distress, less than in cardiologically healthy patients, triggers the development of a TTS. Whether the five syncopes were rather due to ventricular arrhythmias, due to transient heart failure, or due to cardiovascular embolism than due to the carotid artery stenosis remains speculative. Seizures were excluded as a cause of the syncopes.In conclusion, this case shows that LVHT occurs in NMD patients and that patients with LVHT and a NMD may experience a TTS. Whether patients with LVHT and a NMD are particularly prone to develop a TTS requires further investigations. NMD patients with LVHT should avoid extreme stress not to trigger a TTS.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.JF was assigned in patient care, design, literature search, discussion, and the first draft of the manuscript.

Aortic Root Abscess with Aorta to Right Atrium Fistula due to Vancomycin-Intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA)

Hankinson et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We present a case of root abscess with aorta to right atrium fistula due to vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) after limb amputation and cardiac surgery. Patient underwent redo aortic valve replacement, patch repair of aorta to right atrial fistula, and tricuspid valve repair with a ring. Fistula formation is a rare complication of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). This is the first case to discuss aortocavitary fistula (ACF) formation due to VISA. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose ACF.The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms makes the medical management of endocarditis increasingly difficult. TEE is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose ACF. Surgical repair continues to be the definitive treatment option for ACF.Our patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (on prednisone), left below the knee amputation (BKA), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) with a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery (SVG to RCA), aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a bioprosthetic valve, and mitral valve replacement (MVR) with a bioprosthetic valve who presented with fever, chills, and generalized weakness after a prolonged course of vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia.The patient was previously admitted for left foot MRSA osteomyelitis. During that hospitalization, the patient had a myocardial infarction. Source control obtained with BKA of the left leg and five days later subsequently underwent CABG (SVG to RCA), AVR for severe aortic stenosis (AS), and MVR for severe mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient was discharged with a six-week course of vancomycin; however, vancomycin course was extended due to BKA wound that required skin graft surgery. Eighty-eight days after cardiac surgery, the patient was readmitted for MRSA bacteremia attributed to cellulitis of the BKA stump vs. endocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at that time was negative for PVE. Patient was treated with a six-week course of vancomycin, and BKA stump cellulitis subsequently resolved. Five days after completing antibiotics, the patient presented with MRSA bacteremia, which progressed to VISA bacteremia with a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 μg/mL (Table 1). The patient was started on daptomycin, ceftaroline, and rifampin for VISA bacteremia. TEE showed aortic root thickening suggestive of abscess with associated structural defect, a mobile  echodensity projecting into the right atrium (RA) (Figure 1(a)), and left to right shunting (Figure 1(b)).The patient subsequently underwent cardiac surgery for redo AVR with a bovine pericardial tissue valve, patch repair of aorta to right atrial fistula with a bovine pericardial patching material from both the left ventricular side and right atrial side, and tricuspid valve repair with a ring. Postsurgery TTE demonstrated a normal left ventricle size and systolic function, a normal right ventricle size and function, a bioprosthetic valve in aortic position (mean gradient 20 mmHg and peak gradient 45 mmHg) and no aortic regurgitation, and an annuloplasty ring indicative of tricuspid valve repair.This case discusses ACF formation as a complication of cardiac surgery shortly after limb amputation. PVE is a devastating complication of valve replacement with the prevalence being 4.1% at 4 years after primary valve replacement with the greatest risk occurring 1 to 2 months after surgery [1].ACF is a rare condition caused by congenital abnormalities, aortic dissection, valve replacement, and infective endocarditis (IE) [2]. The pathogenesis of ACF related to infection is caused by extension and infiltration of abscesses related to endocarditis. Annular infection affects contiguous tissue leading to pyogenesis and tissue necrosis, which causes formation of an abscess cavity. As a result, the weakened necrotic myocardium may expand and rupture which may create intracardiac fistulous communications or even pericardial shunts [3]. Echocardiography can be used to identify the location of the lesion while angiography is often used to demonstrate the course of the lesion and define the surgical approach. Anguera et al. demonstrated that the detection of ACF for TTE and TEE is 53% and 97%, respectively [4]. TEE is the superior imaging technique because the flow across the fistula is highly turbulent and Doppler mapping can easily detect pressure differences between the aorta and cardiac chambers even when the fistulous orifice is small; therefore, TEE allows for the detection of almost all fistulas and allows the optimal characterization of each fistula tract. Additionally, TEE is superior to TTE in assessing valve function and morphology as well as delineating intracardiac pathology such as complications of endocarditis, namely, root abscess and fistulas. Furthermore, TEE has a better signal to the noise ratio and proximity of the transducer to the heart leading to higher quality images with lesser attenuation [5].Our case is unique because it is the first case of ACF due to VISA. Our patient had extensive comorbidities prior to BKA including cardiac issues, sepsis, and steroid use, all of which have been shown to be predictors of increased mortality and postoperative complications within 30 days after BKA [6]. Given these comorbidities, perhaps a longer time course should have elapsed between the BKA in order to further optimize the patient prior to cardiac surgery. Overall, these comorbidities lead to a prolonged course of vancomycin, which resulted in the development of a MDR organism.VISA and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) are relatively rare infections that occur in the setting of heavy prior use of glycopeptide antibiotics [7]. The Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) defines VISA as a vancomycin MIC of 4-8 μg/mL and VRSA as a vancomycin MIC of ≥16 μg/mL [8]. Vancomycin  is associated with vancomycin treatment failures in MRSA IE, which is a novel concept for this cohort [9]. MRSA resistance to vancomycin occurs through a variety of mechanisms including cell wall thickening, decreased autolysis, reduced production of cell surface protein A, increased capsule expressions, increased D-alanylation of teichoic acids, and reduced agr activity [8]. Given the prolonged course of vancomycin prior to the discovery of the ACF, it is difficult to identify whether the valve annulus was seeded during implantation of the valve or BKA stump cellulitis lead to hematogenous seeding of the valve.Presented above was a case of a patient with an ACF due to VISA. This case demonstrated that protracted use of vancomycin resulted in VISA IE. Clinicians should exercise caution in patients with high bacterial load infections after prolonged antibiotic use. Infectious disease specialist consultation, change in antibiotic regimen, and aggressive surgical management are appropriate for the management of VISA IE.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.“Color doppler video” (supplementary material 1)  mobile echodensity in the RA with a systolic left to right shunt.

Surgery for Bacterial Endocarditis Complicated by Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage
Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Shimonoseki City Hospital, Shimonoseki, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Kazuhiro Kurisu; pj.kooltuo@usirukuzakReceived 22 February 2019; Revised 24 April 2019; Accepted 14 May 2019; Published 28 May 2019Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2019 Kazuhiro Kurisu et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is a very rare but potentially lethal condition resulting from various disorders. We report the case of a patient who suffered diffuse alveolar hemorrhage subsequent to bacterial endocarditis and survived aortic valve replacement, which was applied after improvement in respiratory distress. We believe that the strategy of respiratory functional recovery by aggressive rehabilitation is essential for the achievement of a successful surgical outcome in patients with alveolar hemorrhage.Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a very rare but potentially fatal condition [1–3]. Its etiology is wide and includes, inter alia, autoimmune vasculitis, infection, drug toxicities, and organ transplantation [1–3]. As this condition is caused by bleeding into the alveoli resulting from the disruption of the alveolar-capillary basement membrane, respiratory distress is frequently a serious concern [1–3]. Cardiac valve surgery should be avoided in this situation because it may lead to further bleeding and exacerbated respiratory failure. We describe a patient who suffered DAH following bacterial endocarditis and survived aortic valve replacement after improvement in respiratory distress syndrome.A 45-year-old woman, on a regimen of steroids for a diagnosis of Behçet’s disease or systemic lupus erythematosus, was admitted with pyrexia, cough, and worsening dyspnea of a week’s duration. She had a history of small bowel resection for intestinal necrosis and had been on parenteral nutrition since then. She presented a fever of 39.1°C, tachycardia of 116/min, and hypoxia with oxygen saturation of 94% in nasal oxygen cannula. A grade 3/6 regurgitant diastolic murmur was heard in the left third intercostal space on auscultation. She soon fell into respiratory failure and was immediately supported by mechanical ventilation. The ratio of the arterial oxygen pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) was initially calculated as 105. Chest radiography and computed tomography revealed diffuse extensive consolidation in bilateral fields corresponding with DAH (Figure 1). This diagnosis was confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage with increasing bloody secretion in three consecutive aliquots. In a peripheral blood examination, the white blood cell count was 11,540/mm3, hemoglobin 6.6 g/dL, and platelet count 132,000/mm3. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase were 18, 16, and 164 IU/L, respectively. Renal function was slightly affected, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. C-reactive protein was elevated to 12.3 mg/dL. Blood cultures afterward grew Staphylococcus warneri. Echocardiography showed aortic regurgitation and a mobile vegetation of  in size on the commissure between the left and right coronary cusps. Left ventricular function was preserved with an ejection fraction of 62%. The patient was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis [4] complicated with respiratory distress related to the DAH.At this point, she was judged not to tolerate cardiac surgery because of the exacerbating bleeding and respiratory failure related to heparinized extracorporeal circulation. The management plan was as follows: (1) antibiotic and inotropic therapies with diuretics for the bacterial endocarditis and heart failure, (2) steroid pulse and hemostatic drug therapies for DAH, and (3) postponement of cardiac surgery until sufficient improvement in respiratory function unless circulation collapses. Nevertheless, the respiratory function initially made little improvement despite adequate cardiac condition. Because the clot in the alveolar space could not be excreted in the usual supine position, a tracheotomy followed by aggressive positional changes to include an abdominal position was planned. The tracheotomy was performed on hospital day 12. Thereafter, respiratory function gradually improved although mechanical ventilation was still needed, and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio reached 356 on hospital day 31. Methylprednisolone was then adjusted to a maintenance dose of 40 mg/day, and daptomycin was administered at 210 mg/day. The white blood cell count was 8,210/mm3 with a shift to the left, and C-reactive protein was 10.2 mg/dL. Repeated echocardiography revealed worsening aortic regurgitation suggesting the disruption of the commissure between the left and right coronary cusps and the mildly enlarged vegetation. We decided to perform the valve surgery in this timing when the respiratory distress improved.J shaped partial sternotomy was performed between the second intercostal space and the xiphoid process. A cardiopulmonary bypass was equipped with right femoral artery perfusion and right atrial drainage. A 19 mm St. Jude Medical mechanical prosthesis (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) was inserted with subannular reinforcement [5] using a rifampicin-soaked woven Dacron graft (Vascutek, Terumo, Inchinnan, UK) to prevent valve detachment associated with Behçet’s disease. Respiratory function was well maintained, and mechanical ventilation support was discontinued on the seventh postoperative day. The control of infection was satisfactory. The patient was discharged home following closure of the tracheotomy. Methylprednisolone therapy was continued at the maintenance dose of 40 mg/day during the operative and postoperative days. Daptomycin was also used at the same dose of 210 mg/day, and ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium was added only on the day of operation.DAH is a potentially fatal condition because the respiratory function is seriously impaired by bleeding into the alveoli resulting from the disruption of the alveolar-capillary basement membrane [1–3]. Its etiology is wide and includes autoimmune vasculitis, infection, drug toxicities, and organ transplantation [1–3]. In this particular case, we speculate the autoimmune vasculitis resulted from inflammation provoked by the bacterial infection and caused the disruption of the alveolar-capillary basement membrane and further alveolar hemorrhage. Systemic lupus erythematosus probably participated in the mechanism of this illness. DAH resulting from bacterial endocarditis is extremely rare, and this combination has been reported only once, by Wu et al. [6], who treated their patient with intravenous antibiotic therapy but not surgically. To our knowledge, the present patient is the first to survive surgery for infective endocarditis complicated with DAH.The reported in-hospital mortality of DAH ranged from roughly 25% to 50% [1–3]. Quadrelli et al. reported that mortality is higher in patients who require dialysis and/or mechanical ventilation and SaO2 under 90% at admission [1]. Zamora et al. showed that the factors associated with increased mortality include mechanical ventilation, infection, and cyclophosphamide therapy [2]. Kohashi et al. proposed that factors for poor prognosis are a lactate dehydrogenase level over 230 IU/L, PaO2/FiO2 ratio under 300, and consolidation shadows on computed tomography [3]. The condition of our patient, with respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation support, active infective endocarditis, and consolidation shadows on images, was presumed to be very serious. Although surgical intervention was considered indispensable for the treatment of this endocarditis, we concluded that the patient would be unable to tolerate the surgery at first. We surmised that a procedure for respiratory functional improvement by excreting the clot from the alveolar space would be essential to obtain a successful surgical outcome in this situation. Although initially not sufficient, remarkable improvement in respiratory distress was achieved by aggressive respiratory rehabilitation with frequent positional change following the tracheotomy. The patient consequently underwent aortic valve replacement without any respiratory and infectious complications.We adopted subannular reinforcement [5] using a woven Dacron graft in aortic valve replacement to prevent valve detachment. Although other surgeons consider the technique troublesome and time-consuming, this procedure might be an effective adjunct for pathology with a potentially fragile annulus.In conclusion, we describe a patient who survived aortic valve replacement for bacterial endocarditis complicated by DAH. We believe that improving respiratory distress by aggressive respiratory rehabilitation to excrete any clots from alveoli is essential for successful cardiac surgery in patients with DAH.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Resistant Ventricular Arrhythmia and the Role of Overdrive Pacing in the Suppression of the Electrical Storm

Management of this life-threatening state depends on the reversal of the cause besides either electrical or medical management of the arrhythmia. We report a case of a 54-year-old male who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention following massive acute myocardial infarction. Afterwards, he developed frequent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias that required multiple shocks and antiarrhythmic medications. Despite all these interventions, it was very difficult to control the electrical instability, but after overdrive ventricular pacing, the storm subsided and within a few days the case was stabilized. Overdrive pacing is an easy temporary modality to control the resistant arrhythmia following myocardial infarction.Electrical storm is a life-threatening arrhythmia that might occur after myocardial infarction. In severe cases, arrhythmias are resistant to medications and the direct current (DC) shock. Repeated shocks are also injurious to the heart and lead to progressive myocardial inflammation and fibrosis [1–4]. The management is usually difficult and challenging with poor prognosis and high mortality. In our case, we found that temporary overdrive pacing gives a safer method to abort the arrhythmia and to avoid progressive myocardial damage with repeated electrical shocks.A 54-year-old diabetic and hypertensive male patient presented with a central chest pain while sleeping that lasted for an hour. On the ambulance, he became drowsy and developed ventricular tachycardia that was reverted to sinus rhythm by DC shock.On admission to ED (3 hours after the pain), he was in pain and in the physical exam and he was fully conscious and oriented and in distress. Vitals were within the normal limits except for a slightly elevated blood pressure of 150/90. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm and ST elevation in leads V1 to V6 with deep Q waves in the same leads (Figure 1).In the coronary catheterization lab (30 minutes after admission to ED), coronary angiography showed total proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery occlusion and midleft circumflex (LCX) 80% lesion. The LAD lesion was stented with a DES.After the procedure, he was stable with residual chest pain. Then, 2 hours later, he was found unresponsive with pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and after a single DC shock, he regained his consciousness and his sinus rhythm again (Figure 2).The next morning, he developed asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia that reverted spontaneously to sinus rhythm; then, the telemetry showed multiple premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) (Figure 3). Amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus was given followed by 1 mg/minute IV infusion for 6 hours and then 0.5 mg/minute IV infusion for 18 hours. Serum electrolytes were within normal limits.After two hours, he developed again asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia and IV lidocaine 70 mg bolus was given. Then, relook coronary angiography showed patent LAD stent and small ostial LCX clot that was aspirated.In the evening, he had ventricular tachycardia (Figure 4) with hypotension, so the situation required the suppression of the arrhythmia by a DC shock, endotracheal intubation, and sedation (midazolam 0.1 mg/kg/hour). An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and norepinephrine infusion 0.1 mcg/kg/minute were initiated to support his cardiogenic shock state.The next day, clusters of ventricular tachycardia triggered by ventricular premature contractions occurred (Figure 5) and required multiple electrical defibrillations. Consequently, the patient was transferred to the catheterization lab, and a transcutaneous pacemaker was inserted.After overdrive pacing with a rate of 100, his rhythm was stable with complete suppression of PVCs and no further attacks of ventricular arrhythmias (Figure 6).In the next day, gradual weaning of inotropes and sedations started until it is completely stopped. His rhythm was stable on oral amiodarone 400 mg twice daily and metoprolol 25 mg twice daily in addition to the pacing.After another 24 hours of stable rhythm, the pacemaker was removed and close observation showed no any ventricular arrhythmias (Figure 7). The next day, the patient was weaned from the mechanical ventilator.He was observed in the coronary care unit for 2 days showing hemodynamic and electrical stability. After 2 weeks of discharge, he was seen in the clinic in a good state of health.Electrical storm (ES) indicates a state of life-threatening cardiac electrical instability characterized by clusters of ventricular arrhythmias in a short amount of time. It is defined as the presence of at least 3 distinct episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia or VF in the last 24 hours. In the patients with an ICD, the most widely accepted definition of the electrical storm is three or more appropriate therapies for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including antitachycardia pacing or shocks, within 24 hours [5].Studies have shown that in only 10-25% of patients with the electrical storm, clear precipitating causes were identified [6]. Some important causes are reversible, and their management can facilitate the control of the arrhythmias like acute myocardial ischemia, new or worsening heart failure, drug intoxication, or electrolyte disturbances.ES is a clinical emergency that needs appropriate early management. Initially, antiarrhythmic drugs such as beta blocker and amiodarone are usually used [7, 8]. The drug of choice to start is amiodarone 150 mg IV over 10 minutes, followed by 1 mg/minute IV infusion for 6 hours and then by 0.5 mg/minute IV infusion for 18 additional hours.Then, beta blockers are very important in the suppression of the sympathetic discharges after the arrhythmias and DC shocks. Propranolol (40 mg every 6 hours) has shown superior efficacy to metoprolol in a trial performed on 60 patients with electrical storm who received amiodarone, and this showed that the time to termination of the arrhythmias was earlier in the propranolol group in addition to lower rate of tachycardia recurrence or ICD discharges and shorter stay in the hospital [9]. There are other medications that can be used as an adjunct to amiodarone and propranolol like procainamide, lidocaine, sotalol, and mexiletine [10–12].In case of failure of medical therapy, radiofrequency catheter ablation of the arrhythmogenic focus is a promising effective method for the management of the ventricular arrhythmia [13].In the recent European Society of Cardiology’s guidelines for the management of ventricular arrhythmias, transvenous catheter overdrive stimulation received a class IIa recommendation, and level of evidence C in case of recurrent ventricular arrhythmia despite the use of drug therapy and catheter ablation is not possible [14].In our case, we report a state of severe electrical storm following a massive acute myocardial infarction. This arrhythmia persisted despite the frequent DC shocks in addition to amiodarone, lidocaine, and beta blocker therapy. In this life-threatening condition, an early intervention is needed to save life, to prevent the short- and long-term sequelae on the myocardial muscles, and to improve the patient’s quality of life. Overdrive pacing is a method utilized to terminate the tachycardia by pacing the patient’s heart at a rate faster than the intrinsic rhythm. Pacing the patient’s heart at a rate of 100 beats per minute succeeded in controlling the arrhythmia without the need of multiple DC shocks.Kurisu et al. [15] reported a similar case, but the electrical storm developed after 7 days of the myocardial infarction that was resistant to the conventional antiarrhythmic medications, and overdrive pacing was a feasible easy way to stabilize the case. Yoshida et al. [16] achieved an excellent suppression of the arrhythmia by overdrive pacing in a patient with multiple myeloma and coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass grafting.Additionally, in the management of the ES, there were other reported management plans. Mulpuru et al. [17] found that sedation with propofol was helpful in controlling the ventricular arrhythmias in a patient who presented with multiple ICD discharges and showed a poor response to oral antiarrhythmic medications. Tsagalou et al. [18] reported a case of an electrical storm that was refractory to amiodarone, metoprolol, and lignocaine, but after substitution of metoprolol with the nonselective propranolol, he achieved a good control of the electrical discharges, showing that propranolol is better than other selective beta blockers in treating ES.ES usually reflects a poor prognosis with higher mortality, increased rate of hospitalization, and negative impact on the quality of life. Also, the electrical cardiac shocks besides their beneficial control of the arrhythmia and their frequency lead to more cardiac damage and progressive inflammation that later end up with cardiac fibrosis and worsening cardiac function [3, 4].In severe cases of electrical storm that is refractory to the initial management, overdrive pacing is a helpful temporary method in the stabilization of the case and it could be a very important early tool to decrease the mortality in resistant arrhythmia after myocardial infarction.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

Takotsubo syndrome is a reversible heart failure syndrome which often presents with symptoms and ECG changes that mimic an acute myocardial infarction. Obstructive coronary artery disease has traditionally been seen as exclusion criteria for the diagnosis of takotsubo; however, recent reports have called this into question and suggest that the two conditions may coexist. Case Summary. We describe a case of an 83-year-old male presenting with chest pain consistent with acute myocardial infarction. The ECG demonstrated anterior ST elevation with bedside echocardiography showing apical wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac catheterisation found an occluded OM2 branch of the left circumflex artery with ventriculography confirming apical ballooning consistent with takotsubo and not in the vascular territory supplied by the occluded epicardial vessel. Repeat echocardiogram 6 weeks later confirmed resolution of the apical wall motion abnormalities consistent with a diagnosis of takotsubo. Discussion. This case demonstrates the finding of takotsubo syndrome in a male patient with acute myocardial infarction. Traditionally, this would preclude a diagnosis of takotsubo; however, following previous reports of takotsubo in association with coronary artery dissection and acute myocardial infarction in female patients, new diagnostic criteria have been proposed which allow the diagnosis of takotsubo in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease. This case adds to the growing body of literature that suggests takotsubo can coexist with acute myocardial infarction; however, it remains to be elucidated if it is a consequence or cause of myocardial infarction.First described in a case series of Japanese patients in 1991 [1], takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a rapidly reversible heart failure syndrome most commonly seen in postmenopausal women following emotional or physical stress [2]. Various terms have been used to describe this condition including broken heart syndrome [3], takotsubo cardiomyopathy [4], and stress-induced cardiomyopathy [5]. TTS is now the preferred nomenclature as patients with takotsubo do not appear to have primary muscle pathology [6]. Presentation mimics acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with chest pain and dyspnoea often associated with ST segment elevation or T wave inversion. In a contemporary western population, an estimated 0.9% of patients admitted for primary PCI were diagnosed with TTS [7]. However, data from the International Takotsubo Registry has shown coronary artery disease coexists in 15.3% of patients with a diagnosis of TTS [8]. The underlying pathophysiology has yet to be fully understood, although a rapid elevation in circulating catecholamine levels in response to stress has traditionally been believed to be a central feature [9]. More recently, however, it has been demonstrated that plasma catecholamine levels are normal or only mild-moderately elevated in patients with TTS [10] and that local cardiac sympathetic hyperactivation results in myocardial stunning [11].An 83-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of diet-controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, gout, and hypertension presented to our institution with a 4-hour history of upper abdominal pain and lower chest tightness associated with dyspnoea, which was partially relieved by intravenous morphine and sublingual glyceryl trinitrate administered by ambulance paramedics. On arrival in the emergency department, a 12-lead ECG showed minimal anterior ST elevation (Figure 1(a)); therefore, a bedside echocardiogram was performed. This demonstrated hypokinesis of the apical third of the anterior, inferior, and lateral walls. Given the borderline ECG changes and regional wall motion abnormalities on echo, the patient was taken for emergency cardiac catheterisation.Angiography revealed an occluded obtuse marginal 2 (OM2) branch of the circumflex artery (Figure 2(c)) with minor disease in the other major epicardial arteries (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Flow was restored following passage of the guidewire, and thrombus was clearly identifiable in the vessel. The lesion was treated with one 2.5 mm × 15 mm drug-eluting stent resulting in TIMI III flow (Figure 2(d)).Ventriculogram done in the RAO projection revealed mid and apical hypokinesis and ballooning with preserved basal function (Figures 2(e) and 2(f)). Ventriculogram from the LAO projection showed posterior wall hypokinesis more in keeping with the ischaemic territory affected by acute plaque rupture.A venous blood gas revealed haemoglobin of 145 g/L (ref 120-170 g/L), normal electrolytes, and blood glucose of 8.7 mmol/L (ref 3.5-7.7 mmol/L). The patient’s initial troponin I was 365 ng/L (ref <26 ng/L) and peaked at 17,180 ng/L the following day. His ECG evolved to show deep symmetrical T wave inversion across the anterolateral and limb leads, clearly more extensive than the distribution of the infarct artery (Figure 1(b)) associated with the prolongation of the QT interval. Formal echocardiogram performed 6 hours following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) showed severe apical ballooning and hypokinesis extending to mid cavity with preservation of basal function, consistent with TTS. The posterolateral wall was also noted to be akinetic in keeping with a region of infarction. There was mild LV systolic dysfunction (EF 45%).The patient was commenced on perindopril and atorvastatin in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. On further questioning, no acute emotional triggers in the patient’s life could be identified. On day 3 of the patient’s admission, troponin was down trending at 8907 ng/L. He was discharged 4 days after presentation, following an uncomplicated inpatient stay. Follow-up echocardiography performed 6 weeks after discharge demonstrated restoration of normal LV systolic function and resolution of the previously seen regional wall motion abnormalities (Figure 3).The current Mayo diagnostic criteria [12] require the presence of a transient regional wall motional abnormality, which extends beyond a single epicardial vascular distribution, and the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease or evidence of acute plaque rupture. However, several recent reports of TTS in association with coronary artery dissection [13] and acute myocardial infarction [14, 15] have led to newly proposed diagnostic criteria which state that TTS may exist as a comorbidity with a variety of illnesses including acute coronary syndromes [16].To our knowledge, this is a unique case describing the association of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) caused by acute plaque rupture and TTS in a male patient. The lack of an emotional trigger in this case suggests a possible causal relationship between the two conditions. The stress associated with AMI could conceivably have resulted in sympathetic activation causing TTS in a distribution not perfused by the occluded OM2 artery. Alternatively, postischaemic myocardial stunning has been proposed as a possible trigger factor [17]. Conversely, AMI may be triggered by TTS [18]. A recent report described a case of thromboembolism from a left ventricular thrombus as a result of TTS causing AMI [19]. Alternatively, pain has been described as a trigger for TTS [20], and the chest pain from AMI could potentially have triggered sympathetic activation.Frangieh et al. found that T wave inversion on presentation was twice as common in TTS (45%) compared with AMI (22%) [21]. The lack of T wave inversion on presentation in this case followed by the development of deep T wave inversion across the precordial leads could suggest that AMI was the initial pathology followed by TTS. Furthermore, the QTc interval increased from 390 msec on the presentation to 527 msec when the T wave inversion evolved. A prolonged QT interval has also been associated with TTS rather than AMI [21, 22]. A shorter time to peak troponin (<6 hours) and smaller troponin rise have been found to be predictive of TTS [22], in contrast to our case where a large troponin rise was seen which peaked 24 hours after admission.This case adds to the growing body of literature suggesting TTS and coronary artery disease may not be mutually exclusive as once thought; however, more work is required to identify the nature of the link and whether TTS is the cause or consequence of AMI in those patients in whom it coexists.The authors confirm that written consent for submission and publication of this case report including images and associated text has been obtained from the patient.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.
A Rare Case of an Ectopic Liver Presenting as Right Atrial Mass

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Ectopic liver tissue is commonly observed in the abdominal cavity in adjacent organs. Extension of hepatic tissue into the intrathoracic cavity is rarely reported. We present the case of a 46-year-old woman with a  mass confirmed by transesophageal echocardiogram to be at the right atrial and inferior vena cava junction that was initially thought to be a myxoma which prompted surgical excision but subsequently identified as ectopic liver by histology.Primary cardiac tumors are rare with an autopsy frequency of 0.001-0.03% [1], whereas the incidence of secondary cardiac tumors is nearly 20 times higher [1–4]. The pathology of an intracardiac mass cannot always be determined by echocardiography, nearly always mandating surgical removal to prevent embolization and confirm the diagnosis. We herein report a rare case in literature of ectopic liver tissue presenting as two separate masses in the right atrium (RA) and inferior cava (IVC) [5–7].A 46-year-old woman with morbid obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, active smoking, and bipolar disorder was evaluated for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation as an outpatient. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a right atrial mass close to the RA-IVC junction. A transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a pedunculated right atrial mobile bilobular mass measuring , not arising from the interatrial septum with extension into the inferior vena cava (Figures 1–3). A secundum atrial septal defect was also identified. The patient was referred to cardiac surgery for resection of a presumed right atrial myxoma given the possibility of embolization. The intraoperative TEE suggested the presence of one bilobulated mass arising low in the right atrium.Using aortic and bicaval cannulation, a right atriotomy was performed and a discrete  mass was removed from the IVC-RA junction near the Eustachian valve. The right atrium was closed and the patient weaned from bypass. The specimen did not appear to be a myxoma, so it was sent for frozen section and interpreted as being ectopic liver tissue. In the interim, a repeat TEE showed an additional discrete  mass in the IVC near the hepatic veins. Femoral venous cannulation was then performed to allow for visualization of the IVC below the pericardial reflection. Through the same right atriotomy and using additional suction directly in the IVC, the IVC mass was visualized and resected. Both specimens were interpreted as showing partially encapsulated liver parenchyma with mild steatosis, fibrosis, ductal proliferation, and periductal chronic inflammation, consistent with ectopic hepatic tissue (Figure 4).Despite a brief period of cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient had persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure ascribed to her morbid obesity and underlying lung disease. She also developed extensive left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis from a presumed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia for which she was treated with argatroban and placement of an IVC filter. Because of chronic respiratory failure, she underwent tracheostomy and feeding tube placement, and she was placed on warfarin for intermittent atrial fibrillation due to her CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4. She gradually improved and was transferred to rehab where her tracheostomy tube and PEG tube were removed. A few months later, she looked quite well during an office visit.The differential diagnosis of intracardiac masses include benign tumors, primary or metastatic malignant tumors, and thrombus (Figure 5) [8]. The location, attachment site, size, shape, and underlying patient characteristics are helpful in prioritizing the diagnosis. Myxomas are the most common benign tumor located in the right atrium, and renal cell carcinoma is the most common tumor located at the RA-IVC junction [9]. Symptoms from the right atrial masses may result from obstruction of blood flow through the tricuspid valve mimicking tricuspid stenosis, distal embolization to the lungs, or in the case of an atrial septal defect, embolization to the systemic circulation.The incidence of ectopic liver described by laparoscopic and autopsy studies is less than 0.5% [10–12]. In the absence of trauma, most cases of ectopic liver are believed to be congenital in origin. The liver develops from the ventral outgrowth of the foregut during the 4th week of gestation. The exact pathogenesis of ectopic liver is unclear and Trocciola et al. [5] offer the following hypotheses: (1) development from the second liver bud, (2) development from the original liver bud with migration of cells to form an accessory liver that is connected to the original liver by a stalk, (3) incomplete atrophy or regression of the developing liver lobes, and (4) migration of nests of hepatic cells outside the developing liver. Ectopic liver is usually found in an intraabdominal location but rarely in the intrathoracic cavity or heart. Ectopic liver is found to have increased neoplastic potential [13] and should be resected when identified, although rarely is the diagnosis suspected beforehand.Isolated right atrial masses are rare and most are discovered incidentally on echocardiography or CT scanning. Imaging studies are useful to identify their size, mobility, and sites of attachment. Resection should be guided by symptoms and/or embolic potential of these masses. The location, attachment, texture, and consistency can provide a clue to the origin of these masses. Intracardiac ectopic liver is an extremely rare diagnosis, but an important one to make primarily due to an increased incidence of carcinogenesis in the ectopic tissue. In our patient, the presence of a separate tumor mass in the high inferior vena may have been a clue that this mass was not a myxoma or a renal cell carcinoma. Resection of caval tumors can be a technical challenge [14], depending on the extent of the tumor. In our patient, it was not immediately recognized that there were two masses, so the initial cannulation technique was inadequate to resect the IVC mass. Use of femoral venous cannulation was therefore required for better visualization.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Incidental Finding of Giant Coronary Artery Aneurysms Successfully Treated with Medical Therapy
Division of Cardiology, Vidant Medical Center-East Carolina University at Brody School of Medicine, Greenville, NC, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Assad Movahed; ude.uce@adehavomReceived 2 February 2019; Accepted 14 March 2019; Published 8 May 2019Academic Editor: Ertugrul ErcanCopyright © 2019 Rony Shammas et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We report a case of a 30-year-old male who presented with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection with left lower lobe consolidation and cardiomegaly on a chest radiography. The presence of cardiomegaly lead to further cardiac evaluation revealing giant coronary aneurysms. The patient was treated conservatively with Coumadin and aspirin and has done well at four years of follow-up.Coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) are defined as a focal dilation of coronary segments of at least 1.5 times the adjacent normal segment, whereas the term coronary artery ectasia is used to define similar, but more diffuse, lesions. The overall incidence ranges from 0.3 to nearly 5%. With more widespread use of coronary angiography, CAAs have been increasingly identified as an incidental finding. Giant CAAs defined as dilation of the artery greater than 4 times the reference diameter are rare.A 30-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, autism, and scoliosis presented to the emergency department with complaints of left-sided pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and fever.Initial work-up revealed a white blood cell count of 19,300 and a chest radiography (Figure 1) showed left lower lobe consolidation, cardiomegaly, and a calcified mass in the left lung base. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 114 with right axis deviation and non-specific ST-T changes (Figure 2). He was initially treated for pneumonia and subsequently underwent an echocardiogram (Figure 3) due to findings of cardiomegaly on the chest radiograph. This revealed a large extra cardiac mass alongside the left ventricle with normal left and right ventricular size and function.Computed tomographic scan of the chest (Figure 4) showed large mostly thrombosed proximal and mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) aneurysm measuring 7.7 cm in addition to a smaller calcified distal aneurysm which corresponds to the mass seen on the chest radiography. The LAD lumen appeared to be patent (asterisk). Coronary angiography (Figure 5) confirmed the presence of multiple aneurysms within the left main coronary artery and LAD with slow flow. The large mid LAD aneurysm was not well delineated on the angiogram due to the absence of calcification. No aneurysmal changes were noted in the right coronary or left circumflex arteries.Due to the extensive and diffuse nature of the aneurysmal changes which involved the whole length of the LAD in addition to the substantial amount of organized thrombus, surgical intervention was not felt to be feasible. The patient was placed on Coumadin, atorvastatin, and aspirin and has not had a cardiac event over a 4-year follow-up period.Coronary artery aneurysms are defined as a focal dilation of coronary segments of at least 1.5 times the adjacent normal segment, whereas the term coronary artery ectasia is used to define similar, but more diffuse, lesions [1]. The right coronary artery is usually the most affected artery (40%) followed by the left anterior descending (32%), and the left main being the least affected artery (3.5%) [2]. Mechanisms underlying their formation including a molecular basis (a possible role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)) are being investigated as suggested by Lamblin et al. [3]. They report that the 5A/5A genotype of MMP-3 was significantly more frequent in patients with coronary aneurysms than in controls. The pathogenesis of the formation of CAAs is not clear; however, a few mechanisms have been proposed including individual genetic susceptibility, atherosclerosis, and iatrogenic injury following percutaneous interventions, in addition to congenital etiology, vasculitis, and connective tissue disorders such as Kawasaki disease and Marfan syndrome. Fibromuscular dysplasia, a nonatherosclerotic and non-inflammatory vascular disease, commonly associated with lesions of the internal carotid and renal arteries, has also been linked to CAA [4].The two common classifications of CAAs are either saccular or fusiform. Saccular aneurysms are found to be more common in the left anterior descending artery than in other coronary arteries [5, 6]. The clinical presentation of CAAs can vary widely and mostly depends on the underlying etiology. The slow flow of blood on the irregular internal surface of the aneurysm wall predisposes to the formation of thrombi with potential for subsequent embolization, resulting in ischemic symptoms [6–9].Although CAAs are mostly detected incidentally during angiography, they are much less likely to show up on a chest radiograph or echocardiogram as in our case. Other useful modalities for diagnosis are computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance angiography. During angiography, delayed antegrade contrast filling, segmental back flow, and contrast stasis in the dilated coronary segment often hamper optimal imaging [10]. Intravascular ultrasound can be extremely helpful to supplement angiography and may be considered to help distinguish between true aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, and segments with aneurysmal appearance which may be due to stenosis.Since the natural history and prognosis are related to multiple factors, the decisions around treatment should be tailored to each patient and should consider many aspects such as the clinical presentation, etiology, aneurysm size, location, association with infections, and the presence and extent of any coexisting atherosclerosis [2, 11, 12]. In general, the smaller the size of the aneurysm and earlier the treatment is initiated, the lower the chance of major adverse cardiac outcomes [13–15]. Doi et al. suggested a possible advantage of anticoagulation in patients with CAA and acute coronary syndrome [16]. Percutaneous intervention may be performed in certain cases, using covered stents; however, substantial thrombus burden, sizing, and landing zone assessment may be problematic. Surgical options include resection of the aneurysm, proximal and/or distal ligation, and aneurysmal thrombectomy, with or without bypass grafting. The role of newer anticoagulants in the management of CAAs remains to be studied.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Periaortic Abscess following DeBakey Type-1 Aortic Dissection Repair with Dacron Graft—Early Diagnosis and Management

RodriguezCopyright © 2019 Rishi Raj et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 71-year-old male with history of DeBakey type-1 aortic dissection and repair with dacron graft three months prior to presentation was brought to the emergency room with complaints of high-grade fevers, chills, and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray revealed right lower lobe infiltrates and widened superior mediastinum. A follow-up CT chest with contrast showed fluid collection around the aortic graft. He was started on intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a TEE was done for further evaluation of periaortic fluid collection which showed findings to suggest periaortic abscess. The patient underwent surgical drainage of the abscess and was found to have an abscess around the surgical aortic graft which was drained followed by two weeks of antibiotic treatment. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility and remained asymptomatic at three-month follow-up appointment. Type-1 aortic dissection is a medical emergency requiring acute surgical intervention, and despite significant advancements in diagnosis and management, the immediate and long-term complications remain high leading to increased risk of mortality. Our patient developed spontaneous periaortic abscess three months postoperatively requiring intensive antibiotic therapy along with surgical drainage. Our case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and management of late complications of periaortic abscess in patients with aortic dissection repair.Graft and perigraft infections are dreaded complications following aortic repair surgeries with high mortality rates. Accurate and early detection and prompt surgical treatment are of paramount importance in reducing mortality in such cases. Although it has been widely accepted that surgical explantation with long-term antibiotics reduces mortality drastically compared to conservative measures, there is no consensus on the treatment approach for this entity. Recent studies have shown graft-sparing surgical therapy to be safe and effective for aortic graft infection which occur within 1 month postaortic dissection repair surgery. However, replacement of graft with biological conduits was showed to be better when aortic infection happens 3-6 months postaortic dissection repair [1]. Here, we present a case of early-onset periaortic infection and abscess formation following aortic dissection repair who was successfully managed without graft explantation.A 71-year-old Caucasian hypertensive, diabetic male with past medical history significant for critical coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, carotid artery stenosis, and subclavian vein thrombosis presented to the emergency room with chief complaints of high-grade fever of one day duration associated with chills and shortness of breath. Three months prior to presentation, the patient developed acute aortic dissection DeBakey type-1 for which he underwent emergent cardiothoracic surgery and dacron graft repair of the ascending aorta. Few days following his discharge, he started having low-grade fevers which was associated with night sweats, dry cough, and exertional dyspnea for which the patient did not seek medical attention until one week from the visit date. Prior to presentation, he was treated at an urgent-care facility with a five-day course of doxycycline for the same complaints with a working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia with only partial improvement of his symptoms. One day prior to presentation, he developed high-grade fever. He denied any chest pain, rashes on his body, and painful nodules on his hands or feet. On admission, his blood pressure was 137/68 mmHg, pulse rate 113 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 18/minute, and he was saturating of 99% on room air. He was febrile with temperature of 102.6°F. Physical examination was remarkable for tachycardia and early diastolic murmur in the aortic area and a pansystolic murmur best heard in the apex with radiation to the axilla. The sternotomy scar on his chest was well-healed.Initial laboratory investigation results are presented in Table 1, along with reference range values. Notably, his WBCs, lactic acid level, and procalcitonin levels were within normal range. A chest X-ray as part of the routine work-up was ordered from the emergency room and showed widening of the superior mediastinum compared to his prior film (Figure 1). Due to this concerning finding, a CT scan of the chest with contrast was ordered and showed a new fluid collection surrounding the ascending aorta and extending into the aortic arch measuring 5 cm in mediolateral dimension at the level of aortic arch (Figure 2). The patient was admitted to the medical floors with working diagnosis of aortic graft infection. Blood cultures were drawn and vancomycin 1 gm every 12 hours and piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g every 6 hours was started. Cardiothoracic surgeons were called in to evaluate the patient for possible surgical evacuation of the abscess and explantation of the graft. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TEE) was recommended by the surgical team for better visualization of the valves and their involvement. The TEE showed an echolucent area (Figure 3) consistent with fluid or blood around the ascending aorta conduit graft concerning for periconduit leak or abscess. It also revealed moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation (Figure 4) with global left ventricular hypokinesis, but no valvular or perivalvular vegetations concerning for endocarditis. At this point, a decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for drainage of the abscess. On surgical exploration, purulent material was drained from the wall of the aorta around the graft and microbiological cultures were obtained. Intraoperatively, it was found that there was a clear demarcation between the graft and the abscess collection; and therefore, a decision was made not to explant the graft. Mediastinal drains were placed, and patient underwent continuous irrigation with betadine. Microbiological cultures from the abscess remained negative. Patient was continued on intravenous antibiotics for 2 weeks and was eventually discharge to rehabilitation after completion of two weeks of inpatient antibiotic treatment following sternotomy. He started to defervesce postoperatively and remained afebrile upon discharge. Interestingly, both his blood and pus cultures were negative, most likely because of early initiation of potent broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient was advised to follow up with cardiology for aortic valve repair at a later date as an outpatient.Infections of the aortic graft are rare postoperative complications of aortic surgeries such as repair of the aortic dissection and aneurysms. Although the incidence varies from based on center and expertise ranging anywhere from 1-3% to 0.2-5% in various studies, the condition can be catastrophic and is associated with very high mortality rate ranging from 25 to 75% [2, 3]. Due to its rarity, there are no large studies identifying the predisposing factors for aortic graft infection. Immediate postoperative infections are considered to be from direct inoculation of microbial flora, whereas delayed infection might be due to unevacuated thrombus, persistent leak around graft, nosocomial septicemia, and/or immunocompromised states. Although source of graft infection following open or endovascular procedure remains unrecognized, skin flora is considered to be most commonly encountered pathogen. There are reports of duodenal defects leading to graft infections in cases of abdominal aortic aneurysm; however, no such direct seeding of microbial flora has been reported following thoracic aorta dissection repair.In cases where microbiological culture remains negative due to use of antibiotics, molecular testing (including qPCR or broad-range 16S rDNA) could be useful as they do not rely on the patient being antibiotic naïve and can help establish infectious etiology. In addition, it would also help in differentiating more aggressive organism (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) from less virulent pathogen and potentially indicated the source of infection as low-grade infection tends to happen at time of surgery. Although broad -range 16S rDNA PCR is very specific and have high positive and negative predictive values, it can detect all bacterial DNA present in a sample, including the contaminants which are unavoidably present in reagents, thereby increasing false-positive rate and decreasing sensitivity. It is therefore important to use qPCR studies as the first line and only consider broad-range 16S rDNA PCR as an adjunct to microbiological diagnostics as a second line when infection of a sterile site is highly suspected, but culture and qPCR for the most likely pathogens have been proven negative [4].Symptoms of aortic graft infection are often vague, and this requires a high degree of suspicion on the clinician’s side while treating patients with aortic grafts. It could present as a constellation of symptoms that include fever, malaise, weight loss, back pain, leukocytosis, or abdominal pain. Severe fulminant sepsis can be seen in about one-third of cases of early graft infections. Computerized tomography (CT) with contrast enhancement is the diagnostic modality of choice in aortic graft infections [5]. CT angiography can be supplemented by indium-leucocyte scanning and sinography, which could illustrate whether a draining sinus extends to the graft [6]. Findings to look for in CT scan includes the following:
(a)Persistence of perigraft fluid after 3 months of procedure.(b)Presence of ectopic gas in the aortic wall.(c)Increased soft tissue and loss of normal tissue planes.(d)Formation of pseudoaneurysm.Transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography can support a CT with contrast findings in cases where the thoracic aorta is involved. A 2016 study by Lyons et al. elucidated the diagnostic criteria to be used in suspected cases of aortic graft infection [7]. The management of aortic graft infection collaboration (MAGIC) criteria includes clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings and categorizes each into three major and two minor criteria. Although there are no established treatment guidelines for this clinical entity due to its rarity, most of the existing literature endorses surgical removal of graft over conservative management alone. However, explantation of infected graft is not a good idea in very debilitated and patients with significant comorbidities. In case of conservative management, CT imaging-guided aspiration of the periaortic fluid can supplement antibiotic therapy. The choice of antibiotics is empirical until cultures are available and should have broad gram-positive coverage (both gram-positive and -negative in cases where aortoenteric fistula is suspected). There is no established consensus on the duration of treatment. Most published case reports opted for a minimum of 4-6 weeks of antibiotics with some cases resorting to lifelong antibiotic therapy [8]. Contraindication for conservative treatments are suture-line hemorrhage, graft-enteric fistula, and infected anastomotic aneurysm. High rate of mortality is the norm for aortic graft infection. As reported in an international enquiry with 62 reported cases from different international centers of vascular surgery, mortality among operative cases was 16.3% and that among conservative management was 36.4% [9]. With such high mortality rates, it is important to focus on prevention, early detection, and prompt treatment of this entity.Aortic graft infection is a rare complication of postaortic repair surgeries with very high mortality. The presenting symptoms are often vague and depend on the time of presentation, part of the aorta that is infected, and the virulence of pathogen involved. Fever with new-onset murmur is red flag in patients with aortic grafts in situ and warrants further investigations. In addition, subtle findings such as widening of the mediastinum should not be neglected in such patients to ensure prompt diagnosis. CT chest with contrast enhancement is the diagnostic modality of choice which can reveal perigraft fluid, ectopic gas in the aortic wall, and loss of normal tissue. The criteria defined by MAGIC (Management of Aortic Graft Infection Collaboration) provides a handy tool to arrive at a diagnosis. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics must be initiated at the earliest time after drawing blood cultures. Graft explantation with four to six weeks of antibiotics is the accepted practice in anyone who does not have contraindications for surgery. Conservative management has been resorted to in patients with debility with markedly higher mortality.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

It is usually detected in early childhood with symptoms of recurrent chest infection and finding of pulmonary hypertension due to left to right shunt. We report a case of a 40-year-old woman with scimitar syndrome discovered on chest X-ray during evaluation of recurrent pneumonia. Surgical correction was achieved with a novel technique of using a synthetic graft connecting the scimitar vein across the right atrium to the left atrium along with ligation of the scimitar vein connection to the inferior vena cava. The patient continues to do well 10 years after surgery, and the shunt graft shows good flow on echocardiogram. We present her clinical and imaging data and details of the surgical technique along with a brief review of surgical literature.Scimitar syndrome is a variant of partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC), which results in pulmonary venous connection from the right lung to the inferior vena cava (IVC) [1]. The name is derived from a curvilinear (scimitar-shaped) shadow alongside the right heart border on chest X-ray (Figure 1). Scimitar syndrome is usually associated with other cardiac and pulmonary defects, including atrial septal defects (ASD), dextroposition of the heart, right lung hypoplasia, and pulmonary hypertension [2]. Severe cases in childhood result in cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension, requiring surgical correction. However, some cases are not discovered until adulthood, either due to worsening, symptomatic left to right shunt, or incidental discovery on chest X-ray after recurrent pulmonary infections. Surgical repair of these defects is especially difficult, with several methods requiring cardiopulmonary bypass to repair this anomaly. We present a novel surgical technique used in the repair of scimitar syndrome in a middle-aged woman.A 40-year-old Caucasian woman presented to her primary physician with recurrent fevers, chills, wheezing, and cough. She was a welder by profession and had a long history of respiratory symptoms and allergies. She was treated with a course of antibiotics for a presumed pneumonia. When her cough and other symptoms persisted, a chest X-ray was performed and showed a curvilinear abnormality alongside her right heart border consistent with scimitar syndrome (Figure 1). Upon further review of history, the patient endorsed worsening shortness of breath over the past year and occasional palpitations with exertion, but denied symptoms with normal activity. She had recurrent pulmonary infections and asthma/allergy episodes throughout childhood and adult life. Physical exam showed normal jugular venous pressure (JVP). She had a parasternal heave but her apex was not localized. The heart sounds were normal and she did not have any murmurs.Echocardiogram showed dilatation of the right atrium and right ventricle with and interatrial shunt consistent with a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Ejection fraction was normal.Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 2) showed a hypoplastic right upper lobe and compensatory large right lower lobe. There was a large right pulmonary artery with a large arteriovenous malformation (AVM) from the pulmonary artery into the anomalous scimitar vein which attached to the inferior vena cava. The majority of the right lung pulmonary venous return was to the inferior vena cava via the scimitar vein. A single small vestigial inferior pulmonary vein on the right extended to the left atrium. The left pulmonary veins drained normally into the left atrium.Transthoracic echocardiography (TEE) confirmed right atrial and right ventricular dilatation and normal left pulmonary venous return into the left atrium. There was an atretic right inferior pulmonary vein opening into the right atrium. The right lower pulmonary vein was not visible by echocardiography. A PFO was confirmed by color Doppler and agitated saline injection.Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries and normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The PFO allowed easy passage of the multipurpose catheter into the left atrium. Pulmonary angiography, aortogram, and scimitar venography were also performed using a 6F pigtail catheter. Right pulmonary artery angiogram identified partial anomalous pulmonary venous return via scimitar vein to the IVC (Figure 3). The patient was referred for surgical correction due to persistent shunt and recurrent pulmonary infections. Upon multidisciplinary review of the case, the traditional approach of reimplanting the anomalous scimitar vein into the left atrium was deemed to carry excessive risk and was therefore deferred. After review of the patient’s CT imaging, a simplified interatrial baffle redirecting the anomalous pulmonary venous blood to the left atrium was pursued.After satisfactory general anesthesia, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. With the heart completely decompressed, the lung was retracted. The anomalous vein was identified in an oblique fissure of the right lung and demonstrated to drain through the diaphragm. The anomalous vein was dissected for a distance of several centimeters from the diaphragm up and toward the hilum of the lung. The right atrium was opened through a longitudinal incision approximately 1.5 cm away from the AV groove. There was a large fossa ovalis and a small patent foramen ovale. These landmarks were used as guide for excising the entire fossa ovalis to a diameter of approximately 1.6 to 1.8 cm. A ribbed 16 mm Gore-Tex graft was chosen and sutured end-to-side to this newly created atrial septal defect with continuous 5-0 Prolene suture. A linear incision slightly smaller than the graft was made very low in the lateral right atrial wall, and the graft was brought through this defect and then through a defect in the pleura. A linear incision was made in the anomalous pulmonary vein, and the graft was sutured to this vein meticulously with a continuous 5-0 Prolene suture (Figure 4). After confirming both anastomosis and the patency of the graft, the anomalous vein was ligated between the Gore-Tex graft and the diaphragm. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged on warfarin four days after the procedure.ECHO showed a right ventricular peak systolic pressure of 22 mmHg with no intracardiac shunts. The graft passing through the right atrium was noted to be patent with good flow on Doppler (Figure 5). A pulmonary perfusion scan was performed which showed a differential perfusion of 47.8% to the left lung and 52.2% to the right lung. One-month postoperative cardiac-gated CTA showed that the synthetic graft remained widely patent with no evidence of thrombus (Figures 6–9).The patient noted an uneventful recovery with less fatigue and improvement in her breathing during follow-up visits. She has continued to do well for 10 years after the procedure. The shunt was well-visualized with good flow on serial follow-up echocardiograms.Surgical correction of scimitar syndrome in adults is usually reserved for symptomatic patients with worsening left to right shunt. Numerous surgical techniques have been described, with most requiring deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest. The first corrective operation was performed by Kirklin and associates [3] in 1956 without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Shumacker and Judd [4] devised a method using cardiopulmonary bypass, involving direct reimplantation of the anomalous pulmonary vein into the right atrium. This method was modified by Zubiate and Kay [5] in 1962 with the use of an interatrial patch developed to redirect flow into the left atrium through an ASD.Direct anastomosis of the scimitar vein to the left atrium was first described by Honey [6] in 1977. However, there were frequent complications associated with this method, including inadvertent constriction or occlusion via thrombosis. This thrombosis is attributed to mobilization of the scimitar vein with resultant vessel distortion or the tortuous coursing of the scimitar vein resulting in kinking. Dupuis and colleagues [7] described these complications in a series of 37 patients that underwent classical surgical repair. Of these 37 patients, only 12 had acceptable outcomes without evidence of thrombosis. Additional surgical complications include stenosis of the intracardiac baffle, pulmonary hypertension, and hemoptysis [8].Our method is based upon the approach described by Harrison and colleagues [9]. We used a Gore-Tex graft penetrating through the walls of the right atrium to connect the scimitar vein to the left atrium via a newly created ASD. This method prevents the complications associated with moving the scimitar vein itself, while successfully correcting the left-to-right shunt through a more direct path than the traditional method. The ease and success of this technique should make it the preferred surgical strategy for surgical repair of symptomatic scimitar syndrome in adults.Traditional surgical repair of scimitar syndrome is difficult and complicated. The technique described using synthetic graft baffle provides a more direct path for right-sided pulmonary venous return to the left atrium. The ease and success of this technique and the long-term graft patency should make it the preferred surgical strategy for surgical repair of symptomatic scimitar syndrome in adults.The patient was informed of the nature of the surgical procedure, the associated risks and benefits, and their rights as a patient.

Case Report of an Acute Myocardial Infarction as a Result of Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection in a Patient with Fibromuscular Dysplasia

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an underdiagnosed and rare cause of myocardial infarction (MI). SCAD is defined as the separation of the coronary artery wall by hemorrhage with or without intimal tear. It causes acute coronary syndrome in 1.7% to 4% of cases. Case Summary. We report a case of a patient with acute MI caused by SCAD with marked progression of dissection within 4 days and spontaneous healing in 2 months. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of the arteries is an associated condition of SCAD that was found in our patient. Conclusion. In young women admitted to the clinic with signs of acute myocardial infarction, SCAD should be suspected. FMD as an associated condition that should be ruled out in every SCAD patient. Conservative treatment of SCAD is the most preferable strategy.Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an underdiagnosed and rare cause of myocardial infarction (MI). SCAD is defined as the separation of the coronary artery wall by hemorrhage with or without intimal tear. SCAD causes acute coronary syndrome in 1.7% to 4% of cases [1]. We report a case of a patient with acute MI caused by SCAD with marked progression of dissection within 4 days and spontaneous healing in 2 months.A 47-year-old woman with a 4-day history of chest pain, which had begun directly after emotional stress (air travel), was transferred to our clinic from another hospital. The patient was normosthenic, had practiced gymnastics in youth, and had no signs of joint hypermobility syndrome or other connective tissue disorder. She had smoked for a long time and had arterial hypertension grade 2. She had never experienced chest pain before and was very active in her everyday life.An electrocardiogram upon admission to our clinic revealed a sinus rhythm with a 2 mm ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V3-V5, “-” and T V3-V5 (Figure 1). On echocardiography, an apex dyskinesis was found; the left ventricle ejection fraction was 56%. The level of cardiac troponin-I was 13.2 ng/mL, confirming the development of acute myocardial infarction. We analysed the first angiogram, which had been performed in another clinic. It revealed 70–75% smooth extended narrowing in the middle segment of the left anterior descending artery, and no signs of atherosclerosis in the proximal segment of LAD or the remaining arteries were found. Side branches were absolutely normal as well (Figure 2). It looked like a subintimal hematoma. We repeated the coronary angiography upon admission on day 4; the extension of the culprit lesion to the distal segment of the LAD was observed (Figure 3). Because of the high risk of intima rupture, intravascular visualization was not performed. This finding on the second angiogram confirmed our initial suspicion and corresponded to SCAD type 2.Considering that the association of SCAD and FMD is a well-known fact, we performed angiography of the renal and carotid arteries [2]. In the mid and distal portions of the renal arteries, alternating dilatation and constriction (string-of-beads) were observed (Figure 4), confirming a diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). The patient received conservative treatment only (metoprolol 25 mg/day and aspirin 75 mg/day). In two months, a follow-up visit took place. The patient had no episodes of chest pain or dyspnea. Repeated coronary angiography revealed absolutely normal coronary arteries (Figure 5).The patient developed acute MI without any signs of atherosclerosis. SCAD, defined as the separation of the coronary artery wall by hemorrhage, is a rare underlying cause of acute coronary syndrome [3, 4]. There are three known types of SCAD. Type 1 is characterized by the appearance of a double lumen under contrast staining of the arterial wall. Type 2 appears as diffuse (typically 20 to 30 mm) and smooth narrowing that can vary in severity (due to intramural hematoma). Type 3 appears as focal or tubular stenosis that mimics atherosclerosis and can be confirmed only under intravascular visualization [1, 5].SCAD is often underdiagnosed and mistaken for atherosclerosis. In order to establish the challenging diagnosis of SCAD, the specific flowchart was developed [6]. This flowchart includes clinical and angiographic features of SCAD. In 2017, Motreff et al. identified the specific five angiographic features of SCAD: (1) absence of atheroma on other coronary arteries; (2) radiolucent flap(s); (3) contrast dye staining of the arterial wall; (4) starting and/or ending of the angiographic ambiguity on a side branch; and (5) long narrowing of the lumen calibre: smooth and linear, or stenosis of varying severity mimicking a “stick insect” or “radish” aspect [7]. In this case, we found the following: (1) typical smooth narrowing of the coronary artery, (2) progress of artery dissection in the distal direction in 4 days, (3) no signs of atherosclerosis in the remaining arteries, and (4) dissection ended on a side branch. All these findings were conclusive for SCAD. This case demonstrates the rapid progression of SCAD leading to acute MI.The acute and long-term management of SCAD is not well developed, as there have been no randomized trials assessing the optimal strategy. According to observational studies, most SCAD lesions heal spontaneously [8]. For this reason, the preferred strategy in SCAD treatment is conservative [4]. We chose medical treatment as well. According to data in the literature, the full resolution of SCAD occurs in 12 to 40 months [9, 10]. Our patient was doing well after 2 months; that is why we decided to repeat the control angiography well before 12 months. It revealed a healed coronary artery.SCAD is often accompanied by FMD (in 62–86% of cases) [11]. The recent published study showed that SCAD may have a genetic link to FMD. There is an increased risk for both SCAD and FMD in patients carrying the rs9349379-A allele of PHACTR1/EDN1 genetic locus (chromosome 6q24) [2].FMD is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that results in occlusion, aneurysm, or dissection of the artery. The most commonly affected vascular bed is the renal or carotid arteries (65% of cases) [12]. The exact frequency of FMD of coronary arteries is still unknown, as the diagnosis of coronary FMD is rather challenging. The string-of-beads appearance is rarely seen. In most cases, we can see distal tapering, nonatherosclerotic stenosis, or dissection of the artery [13]. To confirm the diagnosis of coronary FMD, the visualization of another vascular bed is necessary. In our case, we found the typical string-of-beads in renal arteries.In young women admitted to the clinic with signs of acute myocardial infarction, SCAD should be suspected. FMD as an associated condition should be ruled out in every SCAD patient. Conservative treatment of SCAD is the most preferable strategy.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.AK, DS, AK, EV, and AS contributed equally to the care of this patient.

Chronic Type A Aortic Dissection: Rare Presentation of Incidental Pericardial Effusion

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Aortic dissection is the most devastating sequelae of aortopathy other than aortic rupture. However, aortic dissection can be asymptomatic in the acute phase with delayed symptomatic presentation or incidental diagnosis upon chest imaging. We report a case of a 63-year-old male who was diagnosed with pericardial effusion upon preoperative workup for elective cholecystectomy. Further investigations confirmed hemorrhagic pericardial effusion secondary to a chronic dissecting ascending aortic aneurysm. The patient condition was successfully managed with open surgical repair with an uneventful postoperative course. This case demonstrates an extremely rare presentation of incidental hemorrhagic pericardial effusion caused by a chronic dissecting ascending aortic aneurysm.A 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, 20 pack-years of smoking, thyroid cancer in remission with partial thyroidectomy, and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasound showed gallstones with no evidence of cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. The patient was diagnosed with biliary colic and discharged home with a plan to perform an elective cholecystectomy. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed as an outpatient as part of the preoperative workup which showed evidence of gallstones, small bilateral pleural effusions, and moderate pericardial effusion with high density suggestive of hemorrhage (Figure 1). Consequently, the patient was referred to the emergency department for further workup. Upon arrival, the patient was asymptomatic, his vital signs were normal, and his physical examination was unremarkable. An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed a nonspecific interventricular conduction delay. Chest x-ray showed a mildly enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette with prominent perihilar opacities suggestive of a prominent vasculature (Figure 2). Complete blood count and basic metabolic profile were within normal limits. Further laboratory workup showed normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, complement level, and procalcitonin with negative serology for antinuclear antibodies and double-stranded DNA antibodies. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a large pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, moderate aortic regurgitation, and normal left ventricular ejection fraction and size. Given the large volume of pericardial effusion, a pericardial window was attempted. A total of one liter of hemorrhagic fluid was drained. Pericardial tissue biopsy showed acute and chronic inflammatory cells with thickened pericardium, and no malignant cells were detected (Figure 3). Tuberculosis quantiferon assay, acid-fast bacilli staining, and fungal and bacterial cultures of the pericardial tissue were negative. The source of pericardial effusion remained elusive. Given the hemorrhagic nature of the pericardial effusion in the absence of recent use of anticoagulation and the negative workup for infectious or autoimmune etiology, a CT scan of the chest with contrast was obtained to evaluate for possible malignancy. CT showed an ascending aortic aneurysm measuring up to 7.5 cm with chronic dissection with no involvement of the coronaries or the great vessels (Figure 4). The patient underwent successful open surgical repair of his chronic Stanford type A aortic dissection with an uneventful postoperative course.Acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening condition that serves as an impetus to immediate surgical repair aiming to prevent dissection-associated complications such as acute aortic regurgitation, aortic rupture, myocardial or cerebral ischemia, and pericardial tamponade [1]. However, newly diagnosed chronic type A (CTAD) dissections of a native aorta represent a different subpopulation of patients with atypical or absent symptoms at the time of dissection onset precluding the early diagnosis [2–4]. Patients with de novo chronic AD are usually asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis (like our patient) [2]. Thus, newly diagnosed CTAD is usually discovered incidentally upon chest imaging as a prominent aortic knob or mediastinal widening [2]. Therefore, the accurate timing of dissection is often unfeasible [2]. Careful history is needed to identify previous acute chest pain events (heralding dissection onset). Furthermore, the patient may endorse symptoms related to the enlarging dissection (e.g., hoarseness and persisting or recurrent chest pain), malperfusion (e.g., vision changes, extremity pain, and syncope), or valvular disease (e.g., dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower limb swelling) [1, 2, 5]. Amid any suspicion, CTAD has to be confirmed by further specific imaging modalities including transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA), or Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) [1, 2, 5]. Features like thick, immobile intimal flap, aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracic aorta (as in our patient), or the presence of thrombus in the false lumen are suggestive of dissection chronicity [2]. Signs of contained rupture such as pleural effusion or mediastinal hematoma can also be seen in symptomatic patients [2]. Pericardial effusion is a common complication of acute type A AD and usually occurs through two separate mechanisms [5]. The first mechanism is the transudation of fluid across the thin wall of the false lumen into the pericardial cavity which is the most common mechanisms [5]. However, the dissected aorta can rupture directly into the pericardial space with subsequent tamponade [5]. Cardiac tamponade is diagnosed in 8% to 10% of patients presenting with acute type A aortic dissection and is a predictor of poor prognosis, as well as the primary cause of mortality in this subgroup of patients mandating urgent aortic repair [5]. In our case, CTAD was asymptomatic and initially was not clinically suspected; thus, pericardial puncture was carried out for the evaluation of the pericardial effusion. Our patient was hemodynamically stable with no contraindications for contrast administration. Given the negative pericardial fluid analysis, the 20 pack-years of smoking, and the thyroid cancer history, hemorrhagic pericardial effusion secondary to metastatic cancer was suspected. Thus, a CT scan of the chest with contrast was obtained and aortic dissection was incidentally discovered.The first clue for CTAD diagnosis was the detection of high-density pericardial effusion note on abdominal CT scan before elective cholecystectomy. Given the lake of symptoms, transudation of fluid across the wall of the false lumen into the pericardial cavity is the most plausible mechanisms. Also, hemopericardium in our case could be a sign of silent contained rupture.All patients with aortic dissections will need immediate surgical evaluation independent of location [5]. Patients with type B dissections are typically treated conservatively [6]. On the other hand, those with type A dissection (like in our case) needs immediate surgical intervention. Acute medical management as a bridge to possible surgery consists of initial pain control and anti-impulsive therapy (i.e., heart rate and blood pressure control) to alleviate the shearing forces against the aortic wall and minimize the propagation of the dissection. The systolic blood pressure goal is less than 120 mm Hg. It is imperative that chronotropic medications be used first as vasodilators pose the risk of reflex tachycardia and worsening of the dissection [6].Our patient had an aorta diameter of 7.5 cm; furthermore, his dissection was complicated by hemorrhagic pericardial effusion and moderate aortic regurgitation. Thus, the open surgical repair was the chosen approach. According to a recent review of a 696 type A patients, following open repair, patients with CTAD had lower in-hospital mortality and longer five- and ten-year survival compared to the acute type A dissection patients [7]. Our patient had successful CTAD repair with an uneventful postoperative course.Chronic type A aortic dissection is a challenging diagnosis with a wide range of clinical presentations including incidental hemorrhagic pericardial effusion. Pericardial puncture in pericarial effusion complicating type A dissection can result in the propagation of the rupture. Accordingly, obtaining a CT scan of the chest prior to any diagnostic pericardial puncture is highly recommended. Surgical repair is the treatment of choice for complicated chronic type A aortic dissection.None of the authors have any conflicts of interest to declare.
Antithrombotic Dilemmas after Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Watchman Device Placement

In patients with contraindications to oral anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) devices, such as the Watchman™ device, may be considered; however, temporary postimplantation antithrombotic therapy is still a recommended practice. We present a case of complex antithrombotic management, post LAAO device implantation, designed to avoid drug interactions with concomitant rifampin use and remained necessary secondary to subsequent device leak. This case highlights the challenges of antithrombotic therapy post LAAO device placement in a complex, but representative, patient.Antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has dramatically shifted from warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, to the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban [1–4]. In patients with contraindications to oral anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) devices, such as the Watchman™ device (Boston Scientific Corporation; Natick, MA), may be considered [5, 6]. After device implantation, prevention of device-related thrombosis is essential during endothelialization. Prospective studies that investigated the Watchman™ device utilized antithrombotic strategies consisting of warfarin for 45 days post placement, followed by dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 6 months. However, DOACs, in conjunction with aspirin for 3 months, constitute an alternative regimen post device placement [7–10]. Indeed, real-life registry data reveal a spectrum of varied antithrombotic therapy currently in use, which is likely informed by a patient history of major bleeding or ineligibility for oral anticoagulation therapy [9]. The use of alternative anticoagulants, such as low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), post LAAO devices remains unknown. We present a case of complex antithrombotic management post Watchman™ device implantation designed to avoid drug interactions with concomitant rifampin use and subsequent device leak.The patient is a 70-year-old man, with a history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with prior stroke, chronic obstructive lung disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic foot ulcers, and frequent falls, who initially presented with a fall 5 days after Watchman™ device placement. His history of NVAF was complicated by multiple episodes of syncope, despite various strategies including antiarrhythmic therapy. He was previously on dabigatran which resulted in severe bruising and rivaroxaban which was intolerable due to headaches. After discussion with his cardiologist, a Watchman™ device was placed given his high thrombotic risk and prior complications with oral antithrombotic therapy (CHADS2-VASC2 score of 6 and HAS-BLED score of 4) [11, 12]. After device placement, he was started on apixaban 5 mg twice daily plus aspirin 81 mg daily, with the plan for continuation for the following 45 days. However, 5 days after device placement, he presented to the emergency room after a fall, with lethargy, fever, and hypotension. He was found to be in septic shock from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. His hemodynamics and mental status initially improved in the intensive care unit (ICU) on vasopressors, stress dose steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, which were subsequently narrowed to intravenous vancomycin. In addition, his apixaban was transitioned to intravenous unfractionated heparin upon presentation to the ICU. In spite of hemodynamic improvement, his mental status worsened. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed multiple acute small punctuate infarcts in the left corona radiata, right occipital cortex, and right frontal deep white matter. These multifocal strokes were thought to be cardioembolic, not septic in origin. Upon further questioning, the patient admitted to missing doses of apixaban post LAOO device placement. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was obtained; no thrombus in the left atrial appendage was noted, and there were no vegetations or patent foramen ovale. A well-positioned 27 mm Watchman™ device was visualized occluding the LAA orifice with a 1.3 mm paradevice leak, stable from prior. Given high concern for potential seeding of the newly implanted Watchman™ device, a six-week course of intravenous vancomycin plus oral rifampin was recommended by infectious disease consultants as a means of targeting MRSA and additionally preventing biofilm formation and device seeding. This was to be followed by a prolonged suppressive course of oral antibiotics.The patient improved clinically with recovery of mental status and was deemed ready for transition from unfractionated heparin to an oral anticoagulant. Given the concerns about significant drug interactions with either warfarin or a DOAC with concomitant rifampin, a strong cytochrome (CYP) 3A4 inducer, strong permeability glycoprotein (Pgp) inducer, and moderate CYP2C9 inducer, a shared decision was reached to use weight-based LMWH with enoxaparin to complete the 45 days post Watchman™ device implantation.The patient refused repeat TEE at 45 days, and anticoagulation therapy was continued with enoxaparin until the device could be evaluated. Two months after Watchman™ device placement, a repeat TEE was performed, revealing improvement in the paradevice leak from 1.3 mm to 1 mm, and the antithrombotic therapy was transitioned to DAPT with aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. A repeat brain MRI obtained 4 months post LAOO device placement noted a right cerebellar chronic hemorrhage with numerous susceptibility foci distributed in the bilateral supratentorial and infratentorial compartment predominantly in the periphery of the brain parenchyma. Given the short interval since the prior MRI, the presence of these foci was concerning for microemboli of likely cardiac origin. A repeat TEE did not reveal a thrombogenic focus; however, there was persistence of paradevice leak at 1.3 mm. Anticoagulation therapy with apixaban was resumed, and DAPT was discontinued, due to the persistent device leak. The patient continues to struggle with worsening frequent falls; however, he remains functional at home with continued rehabilitation with physical therapy. He continues to take apixaban, living with the risks of associated bleeding that Watchman™ device placement was intended to reduce.The Watchman™ device, a LAAO device, has become an established alternative to oral anticoagulation in patients at risk for stroke with AF who have contraindications to anticoagulant therapy. Prevention of acute device-related thrombosis is critical following initial device placement, which paradoxically requires anticoagulant use. Although strategies vary, warfarin or a DOAC may be considered postimplant [7–9]. Low molecular weight heparins such as enoxaparin offer an attractive alternative to DOACs if oral anticoagulants are contraindicated. However, LMWHs have not been prospectively evaluated for the prevention of device related thrombosis. DAPT monotherapy constitutes a permissible alternative to oral anticoagulation, as real-world registry data reflects that patients with a history of major bleeding or other hard contraindications to anticoagulation therapy have received DAPT exclusively postimplant without an increase in device-related thrombosis [9].In the case, rifampin was recommended as an adjunct to intravenous vancomycin in hopes of preventing biofilm formation of the Watchman™ device in the setting of known MRSA bacteremia, complicating anticoagulant selection. Due to the concerns of potential significant drug interaction between rifampin and the DOACs, these agents were initially deferred. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, can be dose adjusted to overcome the induction from rifampin; however, there remains a risk of warfarin resistance, making this option challenging as well [13, 14]. This patient’s course was further complicated by leakage into the left atrial appendage due to incomplete closure with the Watchman™. This complication has been noted in up to one-third of patients after placement [15]. Despite pervasive concerns about thrombosis, incomplete closure with the device may not lead to increase in thromboembolic events, according to a subanalysis of PROTECT AF [16]. However, given the gravity of possible stroke and systemic embolism with paradevice leaks, many clinicians prefer to continue anticoagulation therapy, as was seen in our case. Given the patient’s high thrombotic risk (CHADS2-VASC2 of 6 and concomitant paradevice leak), a strategy of parenteral subcutaneous anticoagulation with enoxaparin was chosen for the postimplant period. He was later transitioned to DAPT, but as the leak reoccurred and the MRI revealed new foci, DAPT was replaced with a strategy of oral anticoagulation with apixaban selected as the patient was no longer receiving rifampin.This case highlights the challenges with antithrombotic therapy post Watchman™ device placement, due to drug interactions and concern for stroke and systemic embolic due to device leak. A patient should carefully be selected for consideration for Watchman™ device placement, as anticoagulation therapy is often necessary at least temporarily after implantation and decision making regarding choice of anticoagulation may not always be able to be supported by the existing body of literature.Informed consent was obtained prior to publication.All authors state that they have no conflicts of interest and nothing to disclose.T Ahuja, S Murphy, and DJ Sartori were all clinical providers for the patient and major contributors in writing the manuscript.

Successful Use of Pulmonary Vasodilators in Acute Chest Syndrome Complicated by Persistent Right Ventricular Failure
1Department of Internal Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA2Division of Cardiology, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, San Francisco, CA, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Lucas S. Zier; ude.fscu@reiz.saculReceived 18 December 2018; Revised 25 February 2019; Accepted 1 April 2019; Published 18 April 2019Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2019 Jacqueline T. DesJardin and Lucas S. Zier. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a known consequence of sickle cell disease (SCD) and is associated with increased mortality and more frequent episodes of acute chest syndrome (ACS). Pulmonary pressures are known to increase during ACS, and right ventricular (RV) failure has been described as a significant cause of mortality in this condition. Management of ACS includes exchange transfusion, pain control, and prevention of hypovolemia and hypoxemia. However, in patients with a history of precapillary PH in whom ACS is complicated by persistent RV failure and cardiogenic shock, RV afterload reduction with pulmonary vasodilators may be an effective treatment strategy. Here, we present a case of a young man with SCD-associated PH and ACS who was successfully managed with inhaled and oral pulmonary vasodilators in the setting of persistent elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to acute RV failure and cardiogenic shock.Pulmonary hypertension (PH) occurs in 10% of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and can be either pre- or postcapillary [1]. Due to anemia and reduced blood viscosity in SCD, even mild elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) are indicative of precapillary physiology [2]. Precapillary SCD-associated PH is thought to be caused by reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide during hemolysis, chronic thromboembolism, and chronic hypoxia [3]. Six-year mortality in SCD-associated PH is 37%, and those with a higher transpulmonary gradient and PVR have worse outcomes [4, 5]. There may be a relationship between PH and risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS) given elevated pulmonary artery pressures (PAPs) have been associated with more frequent episodes of ACS [6].The pathophysiology of ACS is complex and poorly understood; however, fundamentally ACS is due to vasoocclusion and/or vasoconstriction of the pulmonary microvasculature. PAPs increase during vasoocclusive pain crises and ACS, leading to increased RV afterload and the potential for RV failure [7, 8]. In a study of 70 patients admitted to the intensive care unit with ACS, acute RV failure occurred in 11 patients (16%) and was associated with a 40% mortality due to cardiogenic shock and multiple organ failure [8]. RV failure in ACS is often due to acute pressure overload in patients with baseline PH and RV dysfunction [9]. However, treatment of persistent RV failure in ACS is not well understood, particularly when PVR remains elevated after reversible causes of ACS have been addressed. Pulmonary vasodilators have not been formally studied in this setting, although they may have a role given our current physiologic understanding of ACS and RV failure.Here, we present the case of a man with SCD complicated by PH who developed persistent RV failure and cardiogenic shock after an episode of ACS and was successfully managed with pulmonary vasodilators.A 38-year-old man with homozygous SCD presented to the emergency department with a sickle cell vasoocclusive pain crisis. On presentation, he reported one day of worsening midsternal chest pain and lower back pain. His initial workup was notable for normal vital signs, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (baseline: 12.0 g/dL), absolute reticulocyte count of 374 k/μL, creatinine of 1.16 mg/dL, lactic acid of 1.5 mmol/L, undetectable troponin, and initial chest radiograph with clear lungs.On further chart review, he had a history of remote pulmonary embolism and was on life-long warfarin therapy and a history of precapillary PH. Echocardiogram twenty-two months prior to admission showed a moderately enlarged RV with mildly reduced function and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (ePASP) of 60 mmHg (Figure 1(a)). Right heart catheterization (RHC) nineteen months prior to admission showed mild precapillary PH (Table 1). Pulmonary function testing showed forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 72% predicted, forced vital capacity (FVC) 83% predicted, FEV1/FVC 71% predicted, and corrected diffusion capacity 45% predicted. A sleep study showed nocturnal desaturations and an apnea hypopnea index of 9.5, and he was placed on continuous positive airway pressure with supplemental oxygen at night. His PH was felt to be multifactorial given his history of SCD, mild obstructive sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxia, and prior pulmonary embolism.Following admission, he was started on intravenous fluids and opiates. On hospital day two, his oxygen saturation dropped to 83% and blood pressure to 76/55 mmHg. Arterial blood gas on 6 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula showed a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 65 mmHg. He was placed on high-flow nasal cannula at 40 L/min and 50% fraction of inspired oxygen with improvement in PaO2 to 105 mmHg. Laboratory workup was notable for hemoglobin 8.5 g/dL, reticulocyte count 349 k/μL, 55.2% hemoglobin S, lactic acid 5.0 mmol/L, lactate dehydrogenase 528 U/L, total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, creatinine 1.41 mg/dL, brain natriuretic peptide 586 pg/mL, and troponin 4.09 ng/mL. Chest radiograph showed slight left greater than right suprahilar opacities (Figure 1(b)), and computed tomography angiogram did not demonstrate a pulmonary embolism. Echocardiogram revealed a severely enlarged RV with severely reduced systolic function and an ePASP of 132 mmHg (Figure 2). There was concern for ACS. The patient received empiric vancomycin, meropenem, and azithromycin and underwent exchange transfusion of three units packed red blood cells with improvement in hemoglobin S to 26%. Despite these therapies, he had worsening hypotension over the following twenty-four hours, including requiring up to three vasopressors (norepinephrine, vasopressin, and epinephrine). Cardiology was consulted and, given the unclear etiology of his decompensation, a RHC with a retained pulmonary artery catheter was rapidly performed and demonstrated severely decompensated precapillary PH, acute RV failure, and cardiogenic shock (Table 1).He was diuresed and started on dobutamine. Given his predominantly precapillary PH on RHC, he was also initiated on inhaled epoprostenol to allow for RV afterload reduction and avoid intubation (which was considered extremely high risk). He initially showed rapid improvement and was weaned from epinephrine and vasopressin in the following twelve hours. However, he failed to improve further despite effective diuresis, normal oxygenation, empiric antibiotics, and additional exchange transfusions. He continued to require high-dose dobutamine and inhaled epoprostenol for the following four days. Cardiac index, calculated by the indirect Fick method using a central venous catheter, remained 1.7-1.9 L/min/m2, and attempts to wean inotropic support resulted in hypotension. After several days of inability to wean dobutamine, it became clear that he was in persistent RV failure. Alternative therapies were considered to decrease RV afterload and allow for downtitration of inotropic and inhaled vasodilator support.Phosphodiesterase inhibitors were avoided due to evidence of increased adverse effects in patients with SCD [7]. Endothelin receptor antagonists were avoided because of their potential to cause anemia and fluid retention, especially given the patient’s low hemoglobin, active hemolysis, and decompensated heart failure. Intravenous therapies were considered, although they are not available at our institution and transfer to a tertiary center was declined.Given that the patient had responded well to inhaled epoprostenol, it was felt that an oral agent acting upon the prostanoid pathway was appropriate to trial. We reviewed the literature and found that rapid uptitration of selexipag had been safe in healthy subjects and patients with PH [10–13]. Ultimately, he was initiated on rapidly uptitrated doses of selexipag, reaching target dosing of 1600 μg twice daily over fifteen days. During the rapid uptitration, the patient denied symptoms associated with prostacyclin intolerance. Two days after initiation of selexipag, cardiac index improved to greater than 2 L/min/m2, and right atrial pressure decreased to less than 10 mmHg; eight days after initiation, he was able to be weaned completely from dobutamine and epoprostenol. He was discharged on hospital day 21 and followed up in the cardiology clinic twice in the following year without further episodes of ACS or RV failure. Follow-up echocardiogram ten months after hospitalization on selexipag and macitentan showed improved RV size and function with ePASP 45 mmHg (Figure 1(c)).The mainstay of therapy for ACS is adequate and immediate pain control, prevention of hypovolemia and hypoxemia, empiric antibiotics, and exchange transfusion to achieve hemoglobin . ACS can be caused by infection, pulmonary embolization, and asthma exacerbation, or the trigger can be unknown. However, in patients with a history of PH, ACS may present with worsening RV failure. Acute RV failure from decompensated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is treated with pulmonary vasodilators, inotropic agents, and preload optimization. However, in treating this patient, we learned that little evidence exists to guide management of ACS in SCD when precapillary PH and RV failure persists following the resolution of reversible triggers.Use of pulmonary vasodilators in SCD-associated PH has been understudied in general, not just in ACS. A randomized controlled trial comparing bosentan to placebo in SCD-associated PH was terminated early due to underenrollment [14]. The walk-PHaSST trial was stopped early due to increased pain crises in patients receiving sildenafil; furthermore, therapy with sildenafil did not improve hemodynamics or exercise capacity [7]. The American Thoracic Society recommends a trial of either a prostacyclin agonist or an endothelin receptor antagonist in patients with SCD and precapillary PH [2]. However, these recommendations apply to stable outpatients, and the efficacy of vasodilators in ACS is largely unknown.Inhaled nitric oxide is the best-studied pulmonary vasodilator in treatment of vasoocclusive crises and ACS. In vasoocclusive pain crises, small trials have suggested that iNO is beneficial [15, 16], although this was not confirmed in a larger multicenter trial [17]. In ACS, several case reports have suggested that iNO is safe and effective [18, 19]. However, the only randomized placebo-controlled trial of iNO in ACS did not show statistically significant differences in mortality or need for endotracheal intubation. Notably, patients with hypotension were excluded from this trial [20]. It may be the case that pulmonary vasodilators are beneficial in subgroups of patients who experience RV failure and refractory hypotension as a predominant component of ACS. Other medications, such as epoprostenol or oral pulmonary vasodilators, have not been studied in ACS. Nonetheless, intravenous pulmonary vasodilators and/or iNO are standard of care in decompensated PAH [21].In this case, we chose to initiate pulmonary vasodilators only when RV failure persisted after the acute ACS event; all other parameters (oxygenation, diuresis, and inotropy) had been optimized, and invasive hemodynamics confirmed severely decompensated precapillary PH. We used inhaled epoprostenol and, later, selexipag for RV afterload reduction because of limited access to intravenous prostanoid therapies. It is difficult to determine if the clinical improvement seen in this patient was due to pulmonary vasodilator therapy or delayed resolution of ACS; however, hemodynamic improvement occurred only after vasodilator initiation. Improved afterload reduction with pulmonary vasodilators may have allowed for more successful downtitration of inotropic therapy. In our interpretation, this case demonstrates the potential utility of RV afterload reduction with pulmonary vasodilators in nontraditional clinical settings such as ACS. Certainly, definitive management conclusions cannot be drawn from a single case report. However, given what is known about the pathophysiology of ACS, SCD-associated PH, and RV failure, pulmonary vasodilation should be studied further among patients in whom ACS is complicated by decompensated precapillary PH and cardiogenic shock.The authors declare no conflicts of interest.Publication is made possible in part by support from the UCSF Open Access Publishing Fund.
Percutaneous Aspiration of a Mobile Infected Thrombus from the Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Using the AngioVac System
1Department of Hospital Medicine, Miami Valley Hospital, Dayton, Ohio, USA2Cardiovascular Disease Fellowship, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio, USA3Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, USA4Department of Cardiology, Miami Valley Hospital, Dayton, Ohio, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Justin Ugwu; moc.oohay@nitsujuwguReceived 6 December 2018; Accepted 1 April 2019; Published 17 April 2019Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2019 Justin Ugwu et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The AngioVac system was invented in 2012 and was originally designed for the removal of thrombi from the venous system. It has been successfully used in the management of iliocaval and right endocardial thrombi but is reportedly less effective in the management of pulmonary emboli (PE). Since its advent, there has been interest in its application towards other medical situations. One of the most revolutionary uses thus far has been for percutaneous debridement of valvular and cardiac electronic device-associated vegetations. In most instances, the AngioVac device has been used to obviate the need for surgery in high-risk patients. Here, we describe a novel use of this device in the successful retrieval of a large, mobile, infected thrombus from the right ventricular outflow tract in a high surgical-risk patient.An isolated right ventricular (RV) outflow mass is a rare finding in clinical practice. The differential diagnosis of a mass appearing six days after a negative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in this location includes thrombus, embolus, tumor embolus, and endocardial vegetation. Frequently, initial management options are conservative, including anticoagulation for thrombus/embolus and antibiotics for vegetations. When surgical intervention is indicated, thrombectomy, embolectomy, or vegetectomy is usually invasive and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. As described in several case reports, the AngioVac catheter has proven to be a suitable alternative to surgery in these scenarios [1–3].Our patient is a 64-year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post percutaneous coronary intervention in the setting of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic kidney disease stage III, and prior bariatric surgery. He presented to the emergency department with complaints of fatigue and progressive drainage from a left foot wound with associated pain. The patient was hypotensive (blood pressure 89/53 mmHg) and bradycardic (43 beats/minute) with complete heart block noted on telemetry monitoring and confirmed on 12-lead electrocardiogram. Initial laboratory tests were significant for leukocytosis (white blood cell count 32.1 K/mm3), anemia (hemoglobin 9.5 g/dl), and elevated BUN (51 mg/dl) and creatinine (3.6 mg/dl) from baseline. A temporary transvenous pacemaker was placed emergently in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. The patient was subsequently hospitalized for the management of septic shock, wet gangrene of the left second toe, and complete heart block. Empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and he underwent urgent toe amputation followed by left ankle disarticulation. Postoperatively, the patient developed respiratory failure requiring intubation. Initial blood cultures grew MRSA. Given persistent hemodynamic instability despite presumed infectious source control, echocardiography was performed to rule out infective endocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on hospital day 1 and TEE on day 3 were, however, noncontributory (Figure 1). Bacteremia was persistent through the second week of hospitalization on multiple sets of blood cultures, and antibiotic regimen was changed to ceftaroline. Due to the persistent bacteremia, a whole-body 18-florodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDGPET/CT) scan was then obtained on hospital day 8 which revealed multiple PET-avid lung nodules and cavitary lesions concerning for septic pulmonary emboli (SPE). TEE was then repeated on hospital day 9 revealing a highly mobile echodensity in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) measuring 3.4 cm by 1.6 cm (Figure 2) without valve leaflet or chordae involvement. The patient was evaluated for surgical vegetectomy; however, his surgical risk was deemed prohibitive in the acute setting, and thus conservative management was pursued with antibiotic therapy alone. Infection control was not successfully achieved. From a Heart Team approach, the decision was made to attempt an AngioVac evacuation of the RV mass on hospital day 12.Venous access was obtained at both femoral venous sites with 6-French sheaths, and a right internal jugular access was obtained for the replacement of a temporary pacemaker. The left 6-French sheath was changed out with a 17-French cannula after serial dilatation while the right sheath was replaced with a number 26 DrySeal Sheath. Using a Swan-Ganz catheter, a Swan wire was positioned into the right pulmonary artery (PA). Using an MPA catheter, a Lunderquist wire was positioned in the right PA. The AngioVac return cannula was then attached with a wet-to-wet seal to the perfusion pump. The return cannula was loaded over the Lunderquist wire after removing air from the cannula. Under TEE guidance, the return cannula was advanced into the right atrium. When the return cannula could not be advanced further into the RV outflow tract, it was pulled back and the Lunderquist wire was repositioned into the left PA using the MPA catheter. It was then possible to advance the aspiration catheter back and forth, and this resulted in the return of a large amount of material visually consistent with clots. Activated clotting time was maintained above 300 seconds throughout the procedure with heparin. Postprocedure TEE showed up to 90% resolution of the mass (Figure 3). Aspirated blood sampled from the PA was positive for MRSA. Antibiotic therapy was continued, and subsequent blood cultures were sterile. Resolution of complete heart block was verified on continued telemetry monitoring, and the temporary pacemaker was removed. The patient was eventually discharged in stable condition on hospital day 27.In the case presented here, persistent MRSA bacteremia and SPE on 18F-FDG PET/CT heightened the suspicion for endocardial infection. The RV outflow mass seen on repeat TEE appeared within 6 days of initial negative TEE and was suspected to be an infected thrombus or vegetation. The recommended initial management of right endocardial infection is antibiotics [4]. Surgical intervention is considered in specific situations. In our patient, persistent bacteremia for more than 7 days despite adequate antibiotic therapy was an indication for surgery. As is often the case in endocardial infections, our patient was too unstable clinically to undergo surgery. Recent reports have suggested that AngioVac aspiration could be a minimally invasive alternative to surgery and the decision was made to pursue this option.The AngioVac venous drainage system, invented in 2012, was developed for the removal of fresh, soft thrombi or emboli from the vascular system. It was intended to be used as an alternative to anticoagulation, catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, pharmacomechanical thrombectomy, or open surgical embolectomy [5, 6]. In a single-center analysis of 16 procedures, AngioVac aspiration achieved the removal of more than 70% of thrombi/masses with 67% and 100% success rate for the right atrial and iliocaval sites, respectively [7]. Similarly, Worku et al. analyzed case reports involving 56 procedures which showed the removal of 100% of material in 87% and 82% of iliocaval and intracardiac thrombus, respectively. On the other hand, the success rate for the removal of PE was remarkably low at 12.5% [8]. Pasha et al. had alternatively reported successful management of an acute massive PE in a hemodynamically unstable patient using the AngioVac system [9]. Other novel applications of the AngioVac catheter have been explored. Abubakar et al. published a detailed compilation of case reports including 65 procedures, noting an increasing popularity of AngioVac aspiration for vegetation debulking from right endocardial locations including the right atrium, tricuspid valve, pulmonic valve, and intracardiac device leads. In nearly all cases, successful vegetectomy led to infection control and clinical improvement [10]. In some cases, the AngioVac device has been used as a bridge to surgery [11, 12]. The most serious reported complication associated with the device is access site hematoma [8, 13].With the finding of a large RV outflow mass initially suspected to be an infected thrombus or vegetation, we concluded that this was the source of persistent bacteremia and SPE. We decided that urgent thrombectomy or vegetectomy was the most viable option for infection control and for preventing further potentially catastrophic embolization into the pulmonary vasculature. Since our patient was at prohibitive perioperative risk, we elected to attempt retrieval by AngioVac aspiration. Following successful extraction of 90% of material visibly consistent with thrombus, we were able to achieve rapid control of the infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report detailing successful AngioVac aspiration of a large infected thrombus from the RV outflow tract without serious complications.When a right endocardial mass of any etiology is encountered in clinical practice, consideration should be given to the use of the AngioVac device if evacuation is desired. Use of this new device may be a safer alternative to surgical vegetectomy, particularly when the perioperative risk is prohibitive.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Left Atrial Ball-Shaped Thrombus with Concomitant Biatrial Appendage Thrombi in a Patient with Prior Mitral Valve Replacement
Department of Cardiology, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Osaka, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Takahide Ito; pj.ca.dem-akaso@6103niReceived 31 January 2019; Accepted 2 April 2019; Published 16 April 2019Academic Editor: Ertugrul ErcanCopyright © 2019 Kanako Akamatsu et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We reported a 67-year-old woman in whom large atrial thrombi were found by chance during discontinuation of therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient, with a history of mitral valve replacement surgery, had stopped anticoagulation for months because of intractable gastrointestinal bleeding, during which she was found to have 3 large thrombi in the atria on transesophageal echocardiography: left atrial free-floating ball-shaped thrombus, left atrial appendage thrombus, and right atrial appendage thrombus. One month following diagnosis, she still had the free-floating thrombus despite adequate anticoagulation. Free-floating ball-shaped thrombus is a rare finding observed on echocardiography in patients with mitral valve disease and an even rarer finding in case of appendage thrombi coexisting.Free-floating ball-shaped thrombus in the left atrium is a rare type of cardiac thrombus that may cause embolism, syncope, congestive heart failure, and sudden death [1–3]. It was first reported by Wood in 1814, who described an autopsy record in a 15-year-old girl with rheumatic mitral stenosis presenting recurrent syncope [3]. Since then, there have been a volume of reports on this entity particularly in the echocardiography era [4–11]. We herein reported a 67-year-old woman with prior mitral valve replacement surgery in whom multiple atrial thrombi, including a free-floating ball-shaped thrombus, were found on echocardiography.The woman was referred to the department of cardiology with consultation for left atrial masses detected by chance with follow-up echocardiography and computed tomography (Figure 1). Eight years ago, the patient had undergone mitral valve replacement surgery for rheumatic mitral stenosis. She had discontinued therapeutic anticoagulation for 4 months because she suffered from intractable gastrointestinal bleeding due to radiation therapy for peritoneal dissemination of uterine cancer. Her electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 84 bpm. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a free-floating round-shaped mass in the left atrium that was not detected 5 months before. The left ventricular dimension (44 mm) and ejection fraction (62%) were normal, and the left atrial diameter was markedly increased (65 mm).With the subsequent evaluation by transesophageal echocardiography, using an x8-2t transducer on an EPIQ 9 ultrasound machine (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA), 2 atrial thrombi occupying the left and right atrial appendage cavities, respectively, in addition to the free-floating round-shaped mass were found (Figure 2). The left atrial appendage thrombus was fibrillated with cardiac beats while the right atrial appendage thrombus was immobile. There was a degree of spontaneous echo contrast in both atria indicating a low-flow condition. A moderate degree of stenotic physiology was present across the mitral valve (9.0 mmHg of the mean pressure gradient). With the real-time 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiographic imaging, the round-shaped mass was ascertained to be ball-shaped (Figure 3). The 3-dimensional images of both appendage thrombi are shown in Figure 4.Based on her clinical history (long-standing atrial fibrillation and postprosthetic valve implantation), situations (discontinued anticoagulation and coexistence of appendage thrombi), and previous reports on similar cases [4–11], the ball-shaped free-floating mass was implied as a thrombus. Although a surgical procedure for the atrial thrombi was considered, the patient was determined to be managed conservatively with therapeutic anticoagulation, because she was diagnosed as having terminal cancer and thus in a malnourished condition. One month following anticoagulation, she still had the free-floating thrombus on transthoracic echocardiography. She died a few months after moving to another hospital for palliative care.Free-floating ball-shaped thrombus in the left atrium is a rare finding among patients with mitral valve disease with or without a history of valve replacement surgery [3–8]. This type of thrombus was reported to form in the absence of valve disease and also to recur despite adequate anticoagulation [10, 11]. The precise mechanism behind the occurrence of a free-floating ball-shaped thrombus remains uncertain. In the beginning, the thrombus is considered to be a small mural thrombus attached to the atrial wall [2]. The thrombus gradually grows and projects into the atrial cavity while connecting with the atrial wall via a thin stalk [9]. Then, as the thrombus becomes larger, the stalk becomes thinner and ultimately breaks off the atrial wall. The thrombus, becoming free, moves around in the atrial cavity, polishes itself by the circumjacent structures, and consequently, takes on a smooth, ball-shaped appearance.Nevertheless, the mechanism for free-floating ball-shaped thrombus formation that we and others proposed above seems to differ from the observation by Wright-Smith et al., who demonstrated that the cut section of the ball-shaped thrombus resected from a patient with mitral stenosis represented a laminated and onionskin appearance with central cavitation [4]. Their findings of the thrombus were similar to ours in 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiographic findings with respect to its smooth surface and cavity forming [4], suggesting that such a thrombus grows to form ball-shaped, rather than attached to the atrial wall.Because of the intricate clinical situation, the patient could not receive either surgery or thrombolytic therapy, although prompt surgical removal of the thrombus is generally preferred [2]. We restarted anticoagulation concerning about occurrence of complications such as systemic embolization and valve orifice obstruction. Consequently, no serious complications occurred on the patient until hospital discharge, but her clinical condition precluded histological presentation for the free-floating ball-shaped thrombus, which could have delineated an onionskin appearance as reported by Wright-Smith et al. [4].Although similar cases were abundantly described [4–11], to the best of our knowledge, a free-floating ball-shaped thrombus with coexisting biatrial appendage thrombi imaged on echocardiography was the first reported case. In the only relevant report, Yoshioka et al. introduced a case of left atrial ball-shaped thrombus in conjunction with left atrial appendage thrombus [11]. For our case, in addition, other than anatomical and functional abnormalities of the left atrium, a low-output state associated with stenotic prosthetic valve might facilitate thrombosis in the appendages. Interestingly, compared to the left atrial appendage thrombus, the right appendage thrombus appeared to be organized to a more extent (Figure 4), presumably growing under a laminar blood flow condition specific to the right atrium.This is the first report in which ball-shaped free-floating thrombus and biatrial appendage thrombi were coincidentally imaged on echocardiography. In this case, however, surgical removal of the thrombus was given up because of serious clinical conditions of the patient.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Rare Association between Giant Right Ventricular Myxoma and Right Coronary Artery Tumour Blush with Complicating Pulmonary Tumour Embolism

We describe a case of a right ventricular myxoma complicated with bilateral pulmonary embolism, with an incidental right coronary artery fistula but otherwise normal coronary anatomy on coronary angiogram. This case report emphasizes the importance of performing a transesophageal echo in the setting of pulmonary embolism to search for the origin of thrombus/tumour, and performing a comprehensive assessment is also necessary to rule out coronary artery disease, coronary artery fistula that may also represent a tumour blush.Cardiac myxoma is the most prevalent (50%) benign primary cardiac tumour [1], with 85% arising from the left atrium, 10% from the right atrium, and 5% from the ventricles [2]. Patients can present with constitutional symptoms (fever, lethargy, and weight loss), infection (endocarditis), or nonspecific symptoms of right heart failure, syncope, exertional dyspnea, and pulmonary embolism [3, 4].A 60-year-old man presented with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath on a background of exertional dyspnea associated with self-limiting central chest pain over the past eight years increasing over the past three weeks. Apart from having symptoms suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea, he is a nonsmoker and is in the low-risk group for developing thromboembolism with a Wells’ score of zero on initial assessment. The patient also had no history of familial or recurrent myxoma or stigmata associated with Carney’s complex [5]. In the work-up process, he was found to have no deep venous thrombosis (DVT), but computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed large pulmonary embolism more on the left side (Figures 1 and 2). Transthoracic and transesophageal echo confirmed right ventricular filling defect (Figure 2), which initially was thought to be a right ventricular thrombus and was placed on intravenous heparin therapy. An angiogram revealed incidental distal right coronary artery fistula (Figure 3), without haemodynamic compromise, likely also represents “tumour blush.” During surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), a myxoma arising from the right ventricular septum beneath the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, approximately  in size was identified (Figure 4) and removed without spilling and further fragmentation (Figure 5). The tumour was shaved from the septum without creating any ventricular septal defect (VSD) and protecting the tricuspid valve leaflets (Figure 6). A patent foramen ovale (PFO) was enlarged to create an atrial septal defect (ASD) to inspect the left-sided chambers of the heart, which was subsequently closed. The main pulmonary artery was opened to perform extensive tumour embolectomy, and tumour was retrieved in piecemeal. Histology of tumour and emboli both confirmed to be myxomatous in origin (Figure 7). The patient’s postoperative recovery was uneventful. Postoperatively, he was anticoagulated with Clexane for 4 days and discharged with warfarin with a recommended therapeutic INR between 2 and 2.5 for his pulmonary embolism for a total of six months before reviewing in the follow-up consultation.Cardiac myxoma is associated with embolic phenomena in 30-40% of all cases [6]. Unlike in the left atrial myxoma where systemic arterial embolism is of concern, right-sided myxoma remains an important treatable cause to be ruled out in patients with idiopathic pulmonary embolism [6, 7]. Embolism is likely due to exposed nature and constant agitation of tumour which results in detachment of fragment either of the tumour or of the overlying thrombus.High degree of suspicion of pulmonary embolism is necessary with consequent diagnosis. Missing the diagnosis can have fatal outcome. CTPA is gold standard for diagnosis and then search for thrombus/emboli origin. In current case, Doppler ultrasound of leg veins was negative for DVT, but echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of tumour in the right ventricle. These tumours have a tendency to prolapse into atrium and ventricle with each heartbeat. In this process, they can embolize or even obstruct the major atrioventricular valves with fatal outcome. Urgent surgery is mandatory for good outcome.Embolization rates of patients with both the right and left cardiac myxomas vary between 25.3% [8] and 43% [9]. Studies have shown that morphology of cardiac myxoma is the most predictive factor of embolic events. Villous or papillary myxomas have multiple fine surface extensions that are more fragile and hence more easily embolized than round-shaped myxomas with a smooth surface [10, 11]. Other variables that were associated with embolic events include atrial fibrillation and small tumour size. Tumour size has been shown to be inversely related to the embolic event rate but related to the size of emboli. Friable myxomas tend to fragment and cannot grow large [6]. Conversely, even though it is rare for large cardiac myxomas to undergo total detachment, they still serve as a source for large embolic fragments [12]. Recurrence amongst nonfamilial cardiac myxomas is rare (Up to 3% after surgical resection), and time to recurrence for right-sided cardiac myxomas was reported between 36 and 72 months as compared to recurrence for left-sided cardiac myxomas which can recur earlier between 5 and 60 months [13].In summary, this case report illustrates and supports early diagnosis to search for the cause of pulmonary embolism to reemphasize the importance of transesophageal echocardiogram in the diagnosis of origin of thrombus/tumour and early referral to surgery for good outcome as demonstrated in this case. Furthermore, long-term follow-up is essential to rule out the recurrence of such tumours. A high degree of suspicion is required to include tumour as an important entity in differential diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Comprehensive assessment is necessary to rule out coronary artery disease, which is common in patients with cardiac myxomas [14], and other rare anomalies like coronary artery fistula [15]. In certain cases like this, it may represent tumour blush.Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Percutaneous Valvular Closure Followed by TAV-in-TAV Intervention during a Single Procedure in order to Treat a Severe Paravalvular Leak after Performing TAVI in a Bicuspid Aortic Stenosis

Effective reduction of paravalvular leak is important in order to ensure an optimal clinical outcome. We present here the first case report in which percutaneous valvular closure using Amplatzer plugs followed by a TAV-in-TAV intervention during the same procedure managed to resolve a severe paravalvular leak with haemodynamic instability, after TAVI for a bicuspid aortic stenosis.As the indications for and utilization of TAVI are expanding beyond high-risk patients [1], paravalvular leak (PVL) remains the intervention’s Achilles heel, as it has a negative impact on both short- and long-term prognoses [2–7]. Although several studies had demonstrated that TAVI constitutes a feasible safe intervention in patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS), PVLs were described as one of the intervention’s greatest weakness, as the total incidence of PVLs seems to be higher than in patients with tricuspid AS [8, 9]. Percutaneous closure as well as TAV-in-TAV intervention consists an effective procedure in order to improve PVL severity and symptoms. We present here the first case report of a severe PVL following TAVI, treated with percutaneous valvular closure using Amplatzer plugs and TAV-in-TAV intervention, both performed during a single procedure.A 79-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, stage G3b chronic renal insufficiency, and interstitial lung disease presented with a four-month history of progressive dyspnoea (NYHA III).Transthoracic echocardiography showed a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)) with severe, paradoxical, low-flow, low-gradient (mean gradient 26 mmHg) AS, a calculated aortic orifice area of 0.78 cm2, and a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. A coronary angiogram revealed no significant epicardial coronary stenosis. Aortic root assessment was completed by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), which revealed severe aortic annular calcification, with an aortic valve calcium score of 10133 AV and a large aortic valve annulus (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). After using the three multiplanar reformation planes, measurements were derived from the area as well as the circumference of the virtual basal ring (mean diameter: 30.4 mm, annular area: 726.9 mm2, perimeter: 93.38 mm, long axis: 33.9 mm, and short axis: 26.2 mm). MDCT did not reveal any calcification extending into the left ventricular outflow tract. Additional supra-annular measurement of the valve opening area at the level of the maximal calcification did not show a significant mismatch compared with the initial measurements. Based on his severe comorbidities, characteristics of frailty, and refusal of surgery, the heart team decided to perform a TAVI via a femoral approach.Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed using a  Nucleus balloon (NuMED, NY). Given the aspect of the valve marked by a large annulus with severe annular calcification and the eventual benefit of a valve resheathing and optimised repositioning, a CoreValve Evolut R 34 mm (Medtronic Inc., MN, USA) was implanted. After valve deployment, fluoroscopy and transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)) revealed a PVL due to (i) suboptimal valve expansion because of interference with the valvular ring by nodular calcifications and (ii) low positioning of the aortic valve prosthesis. The patient showed signs of haemodynamic instability, necessitating the initiation of inotropic support.Our initial approach included postdilatation with the largest balloon available in our catheterization laboratory ( Nucleus balloon (NuMED, NY)), attempting a better valve expansion and sealing the paravalvular space. However, fluoroscopy and TEE showed no improvement to the PVL (Supplementary 1). Among the possible strategies, percutaneous valvular closure using Amplatzer plugs constitutes a viable alternative in patients developing a PVL after TAVI [10, 11]. After an urgent discussion, the heart team decided to proceed with paravalvular implantation of a cardiac plug in an attempt to seal the PVL and improve the patient’s haemodynamic status. After measuring the size of the leak by TEE, a Terumo wire (Terumo Interventional Systems, Somerset, New Jersey) was easily pushed through the aortic prosthesis struts, and the first 12 mm Amplatzer Vascular Plug II (AVPII) (AGA Medical Corp., Plymouth, Minnesota) was successfully implanted. Before detachment, coronary permeability was verified by coronary angiography. However, this failed to reduce the severity of the PVL. Following the same procedure as previously, we decided to implant a second 10 mm AVPII (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)) (AGA Medical Corp., Plymouth, Minnesota), which was positioned parallel to the first one. Again, fluoroscopy and TEE did not show any significant reduction in the PVL (Supplementary 2), and the patient remained haemodynamically unstable requiring continuous inotropic therapy.We decided to proceed with a TAV-in-TAV implantation as a rescue procedure, using a second aortic prosthesis (29 mm EDWARDS Sapien 3, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California). This was deployed within the first valve (Figure 4), and the final outcome was the elimination of the AS, the sealing of the PVL, and the presence of a mild residual aortic regurgitation (Figures 5(a) and 5(b), Supplementary 3).Nevertheless, a final aortic root angiography revealed a type A aortic dissection arising in the aortic sinuses and extending into the ascending aorta. The permeability of the coronary arteries was intact, and no pericardial infusion was observed. After a multidisciplinary discussion, a conventional surgical intervention was proposed to the family, but they refused this option. Continuation of all resuscitation therapy was abandoned, and the patient died three days later.Although new TAVI prostheses are designed to reduce the risk of residual aortic regurgitation, PVL after TAVI remains one of the most significant problems. Furthermore, challenging anatomies of bicuspid AS seem to be associated with a higher incidence of PVL following TAVI. Several studies have demonstrated that BAV is associated with more eccentric calcifications as well as with larger annulus. The asymmetry of the valve made of two unequal-sized leaflets can result in an extreme elliptical shape. This particular morphology together with the eccentric geometry of the aortic root increases the risk of uneven expansion of the valve. Despite the fact that percutaneous valvular closure using either Amplatzer plugs [10, 11] or TAV-in-TAV procedures [12, 13] is well described in the literature as reasonable strategies, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case where both interventions were performed during a single procedure to minimise a severe PVL.The present case illustrated the challenges of performing a TAVI in a bicuspid AS with a large valvular annulus. Large annulus and valve undersizing are well associated with PVL and prosthesis migration [14]. A recent study conducted by Attizzani et al. [15] showed a lower rate of procedural and device success, as well as longer procedural durations, among patients treated with a 31 mm CoreValve rather than other valve sizes (23, 26, and 29 mm). Higher rates of TAV-in-TAV bail-out procedures were also reported. The adoption of a sizing strategy based on a multimodal imaging assessment (CT, TEE) therefore seems crucial in order to avoid subsequent prosthesis migration due to the lack of anchoring support. In the present case, we believe that BAV morphology characterized by the fusion of two leaflets results in a potentially suboptimal valve sizing due to the difficulty to accurately identify the true annular plane. The valve undersizing as well as the bicuspid anatomy marked by an elliptic shape and affected by extreme and asymmetric calcification led to a suboptimal expansion of the first aortic prosthesis and its downward migration.Unfortunately, the final stage of the procedure was further complicated by the presence of a type A aortic dissection which eventually led to patient death. Although the precise pathological mechanisms are not completely understood, the dilatation of the ascending aorta in BAV seems to be due to genetic as well as haemodynamic factors. The presence of a severe calcified aorta or a sharply angulated aortic arc as well as a dilated aorta predispose to a vascular complication. The probability increases when repeated endovascular gestures are performed during the intervention. Even though the latest studies have shown excellent results in treating bicuspid AS, especially with the use of new-generation devices, this category of patients was traditionally excluded from the large RCT due to the increased risk of PVL and vascular complications. Thus, these outcomes could further be improved by increased experience and the use of dedicated imaging modalities in the selection of patients.In conclusion, this case demonstrated that a combined approach involving paravalvular Amplatzer plug implantation and a TAV-in-TAV intervention during the same procedure could be a potential option in order to reduce severe PVL associated with haemodynamic instability. However, we cannot exclude that a TAV-in-TAV implantation, as the sole intervention, might have been sufficient to seal the PVL.Dr. Antiochos has received financial support from the SICPA Foundation, the Novartis Foundation for Medical-Biological Research, and the Bangerter-Rhyner Foundation.

Caseous Intracardiac Calcification: A Diagnostic Enigma

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Intramyocardial calcification is a rare phenomenon often only discovered on postmortem. We describe the case of a healthy 69-year-old lady diagnosed with idiopathic caseous intracardiac calcification extending from the mitral valve annulus. We present high-quality images and propose an investigatory template for future cases.A 69-year-old lady was admitted to the acute medical unit with a several-month history of progressive, exertional breathlessness and atypical chest pain. Cardiac risk factors were hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and a positive family history of ischaemic heart disease. Drug therapy on admission was simvastatin and amlodipine.Clinical examination revealed a grade 3 pansystolic murmur radiating to the apex, with no signs of cardiac failure, organomegaly, or lymphadenopathy. The pulse was regular at 81 bpm, BP was 119/90 mmHg, and oxygen saturations were 100% on room air. EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm with fixed, lateral T-wave inversion and ST depression. Serial troponin-Is were 44, 44, and 31 ng/L (normal range: 0-14). Haematology and blood biochemistry were normal including d-dimer, liver function tests, and serum amylase. Chest X-ray demonstrated normal lung fields; however, subtle intracardiac calcification within the cardiac silhouette was visible and comparable to a radiograph in 2015.A transthoracic echocardiogram (echo) demonstrated mobile valve leaflets with an echo-bright structure in the region of the posterior mitral annulus suggestive of calcification. However, views were limited due to poor echogenicity with incomplete visualisation of the myocardium. A transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) revealed a heavily calcified mitral annulus but no mitral stenosis. A bidirectional jet of moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) was noted secondary to extensive mitral annular calcification (MAC) with tethering of the leaflet tips, particularly the anterior mitral valve leaflet. No other valvular heart disease was present, and the left ventricle (LV) retained good contractility throughout with overall normal function.A CT coronary angiogram (CTCA) (Siemens’ SOMATOM Definition Flash CT) showed extensive MAC which infiltrated the left ventricular myocardium resulting in widespread intramyocardial calcification, predominantly in the septum and anterior wall and also in the apex and apical lateral wall (Figure 1). Maximal septal LV wall thickness measured 28 mm and similarly around the infiltrative lesions. The calcified lesions were heterogenous in appearance and extended from the mitral annulus. The external layer of the lesions was calcific, whilst the internal portion was of a heterogenous lower density signal, suggesting caseation. The myocardium contracted normally around the lesions with the estimated ejection fraction of 57%. Calcification of the coronary arteries was apparent with moderate mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) disease and moderate stenosis of the proximal first diagonal vessel. Thoracic CT screening for extracardiac calcification and carcinoma was unremarkable.Due to the extent of the intramyocardial calcification, we sought to determine the aetiology and screen for metabolic disease. Serum calcium, phosphate, and eGFR were normal. PTH levels were slightly raised at 8.6 pmol/L (normal range: 1.3-7.3); the vitamin D level was low at 21 nmol/L (normal range: 100-200) indicating vitamin D deficiency. Hb was 119 g/L (normal: 120-160) with negative haemolytic and haematinic screenings. Lipid profile revealed a triglyceride level of 5.0 mmol/L (normal: 0.12-2.10) and HDL of 0.99 mmol/L (normal: 1.2-1.8) with the total cholesterol measuring 5.7 mmol/L. There was an isolated raised bilirubin of 38 microm/L (range: 0-17), but the direct Coombs test and haptoglobin levels did not suggest haemolytic anaemia. Autoantibody screens (immunoglobulins, ANA, ANCA, dsDNA) were negative. Serum iron levels were slightly low; however, the total iron binding capacity was normal. Serum ACE levels were 24 U/L (normal: 8-52). Abdominal ultrasound confirmed fatty liver infiltration. Tuberculosis exposure was excluded through careful history taking and supported with a negative acid-fast bacilli sputum sample.Although still experiencing exertional breathlessness, the patient’s symptoms improved with low-dose furosemide, and given the presence of coronary artery disease on CTCA, she was discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy added to her current medication regimen.Cardiac MRI was performed (Figure 2), and similar to the CT, this showed extensive calcification extending into the myocardium from the mitral valve annulus, evidenced by the absent signal on T1- and T2-weighted imaging. The lesions enhanced on late gadolinium imaging suggesting the presence of an extracellular matrix within the calcium, but they were not encased entirely by calcium and were in communication with the surrounding myocardium. The findings were consistent with an aggressive caseating, calcific process extending into the left ventricular myocardium from the mitral valve annulus. The infiltrated myocardium was thickened with reduced contractility, whilst the noninfiltrated myocardium contracted well and compensated to maintain an overall normal left ventricular ejection fraction.Coronary angiography showed moderate mid and distal LAD disease, in addition to severe distal posterior descending artery (PDA) disease (Figure 3); this was not felt sufficient to explain the aetiology of her breathlessness.PET CT was requested to further examine the calcified lesions within the myocardium and evaluate for metastatic calcific phenomenon. This scan demonstrated no abnormal uptake nor metabolic activity outside of the heart, therefore providing reassurance for our patient with exclusion of metastatic infiltrative disease. Interestingly, there was some evidence of metabolic activity around the calcified lesions within the heart; however, it is uncertain whether this represents an active disease process or the chronic inflammatory process described in the caseating tissue.Given her symptomatic improvement and normal left ventricular function, ongoing surveillance was arranged with interval scanning.Myocardial calcification may be described in three principle forms: dystrophic, pericarditic, or metastatic. This classification may be useful in identifying the precipitating cause and reaching a unifying diagnosis.Dystrophic calcification derives from degenerative myocardial disease, culminating in deposition of calcium salts along the myocardial tissue [1]. Aortic and mitral valves are recognised susceptible areas through their exposure to high degrees of mechanical force and endothelial disruption. This damaged myocardial tissue creates a calcium-philic surface for the calcium salt deposition usually associated with rheumatic heart disease or ageing [2, 3].Dystrophic calcification can even be divided into endothelial or intramyocardial causes of cardiac endothelial disruption, with ensuing pathological myocardial calcification [3, 4]. Pathologies of myocardial tissue degeneration initiating this endothelial calcification include myocardial infarction, ventricular aneurysms, or preexisting valvular heart disease [3].Whilst intramyocardial and endothelial calcifications can share identical pathological processes, principally through extensive myocardial ischaemia or mixed valvular heart disease, mechanisms unique to intramyocardial calcification have also been described in the literature. Simonson et al. present a case of myocardial calcification secondary to profound septicaemia, with the acute hypotension triggering diffuse myocardial damage. They hypothesise that causes of catecholamine excess and myofibrillar degeneration can initiate an inflammatory cascade which culminates in intramyocardial calcification [4]. CT can further differentiate these intramyocardial aetiologies with its ability to delineate calcification patterns; infarction produces focal curvilinear calcification within the scarred myocardium, in contrast to systemic sepsis which reveals a typically diffuse picture [4]. CT has even identified rare cases of intramyocardial calcification secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), cardiac tumours, and systemic sarcoidosis [1].Intramyocardial and pericarditic causes of MAC can be unified through the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Whilst focal myocardial inflammation associated with previous active tuberculosis can become a precursor for calcific change [5], rarer causes of pericarditis-related calcification progressing to the myocardium are attributed to irradiation, ventricular aneurysms, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and viral aetiologies. These patients typically present with pericardial constriction or from incidental imaging findings [6, 7].Whereas dystrophic and pericarditic calcifications exhibit a normal calcium-phosphate metabolism, metastatic calcification ensues from a derangement of this balance and originates in the previously healthy myocardium [6]. Vascular calcification is a recognised complication of end-stage renal failure, with hyperparathyroidism, hyperuricaemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism as important contributors. MAC has been demonstrated in patients with renal failure, especially dialysis-dependent patients, and develops due to increased levels of serum calcium caused by hyperphosphataemia. Whilst abnormal calcium-phosphate metabolism due to renal failure accounts for a high incidence of structural cardiac calcification, primary hyperparathyroid hormone excess must first be excluded [8].Through careful consideration of this classification, we sought to identify the underlying aetiology of our patient’s myocardial calcification. Our CT series ruled out pericardial extension and its attributed pathology, however demonstrated caseation of the calcified lesions. Cardiac MRI also suggested an aggressive caseating calcific process extending from the mitral valve annulus. Our images revealed a thickened, infiltrated myocardium with normal surrounding myocardium and overall preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, rather than a restrictive defect seen in endomyocardial fibrosis or pericardial disease [8]. Given these appearances of caseous calcification, a complete medical history and comprehensive serology were obtained therefore excluding inflammatory and metabolic aetiologies of myocardial calcification. Furthermore, imaging with thoracic CT and PET CT helps to rule out infiltrative disease and carcinomatous pathologies.Cardiac sarcoid is a recognised differential of myocardial calcification; however, the absence of systemic sarcoidosis together with negative serum ACE and normal calcium levels, in addition to our imaging, sufficiently excluded this diagnosis. Increased sensitivity for diagnosing cardiac sarcoid can be achieve through endomyocardial biopsy which reveals a noncaseating granulomatous pattern, whilst cardiac MRI typically demonstrates subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement with extracardiac uptake evidenced on PET CT [9].The literature identifies dystrophic calcification as the most prevalent aetiology of mitral annular calcification. The presence of calcific deposits extending from our patient’s mitral valve annulus is certainly in keeping with dystrophic calcification secondary to degenerative valve disease. However, caseous calcification, a rare variant of mitral annular calcification, has also been recognised with an estimated prevalence of less than 1% of MAC cases [10, 11]. In contrast to the dense calcific deposition of dystrophic calcification, caseous calcification exhibits central areas of lucency within the calcific envelope and is therefore acknowledged as a separate entity. On a cellular level, microscopy has helped further differentiate the two pathologies, with caseous calcification representing an amorphous, acellular mass with a mild chronic inflammatory reaction stimulated by macrophages and lymphocytes. This perhaps explains our CT PET appearances which demonstrated metabolic activity around the calcified lesions. Though echocardiography may suggest the diagnosis of CMAC through identification of echolucency within the calcification, the limited visualisation we experienced ultimately enhanced the value of the advanced imaging modalities utilised and negated the need for biopsy [11, 12].Cases of intramyocardial calcification are usually discovered on postmortem; therefore, it is rare for us to identify such a case in a minimally symptomatic patient. Strong emphasis should be placed upon establishing the underlying cause of intramyocardial calcification and differentiating the unifying diagnosis from cardiac tumours, myocardial abscesses, or hydatid cysts, given their prognostic implications. In the case of caseous MAC (CMAC), complications of arrhythmia, coronary events, and sudden cardiac death though rare intensify its significance as a diagnostic and prognostic entity [10, 12].Despite establishing the diagnosis of “idiopathic intramyocardial calcification with caseous mitral annular calcification,” the pertinent question remains: How can we best treat our patients? No consensus has been reached on the management of CMAC; one school of thought favours conservative management given the dynamic physiological yet benign process and reported spontaneous resolution of intramyocardial calcification, whilst the other favours surgical decalcification and even mitral valve replacement especially in the context of symptomatic valvular pathology [10, 11, 13]. Dietl et al. even makes the case for elective surgical resection of CCMA in asymptomatic patients [14]. Their review evaluated the prevalence of cerebral embolisation associated with CMAC, with CMAC patients at an increased risk of cardioembolic stroke (19.2%) especially when compared to MAC patients (11.8%, ). This may originate from spontaneous fistulisation and embolisation of caseous necrotic material from the CMAC lesion, rendering anticoagulation ineffective for prevention of cardioembolic stroke [14]. With the ever increasing availability and value of cardiac CT, we expect many physicians to face the challenge of managing this complex condition; therefore, we aim to stimulate further research into the optimal management. For our patient, given the presence of coronary artery disease, we commenced antiplatelet therapy, continued primary cardiovascular prevention with the aim of attenuating the calcific process, and continued with diuretic therapy. She remained stable on clinical follow-up and is awaiting interval scanning.Our case illustrates well the diagnostic enigma of idiopathic intramyocardial calcification. The atypical presentation coupled with the inconclusive first-line investigations posed a diagnostic dilemma. Furthermore, despite establishing a diagnosis of CMAC-associated mitral regurgitation, identifying the aetiology and improving patient symptoms provided additional clinical challenge. This manuscript describes our experience of idiopathic intramyocardial caseous calcification which should guide physicians encountering this condition, as well as stimulate further research into this rare, though fascinating, diagnosis.All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.The authors have no competing interests or competing financial interests.All authors were involved with the clinical case, manuscript write-up, and revision.

However, it is rare to have a complete absence of the interatrial septum (IAS) to be diagnosed in an elderly patient associated with other coexisting anomalies. We present a case of a 60-year-old female presenting with common atrium, coronary arteriovenous fistula, and coronary artery aneurysms. This case highlights rare adult congenital cardiac anomalies and the importance of thorough workup to evaluate for the intracardiac shunt in a patient who has right heart enlargement and development of pulmonary disease in adulthood without a significant history of chronic smoking. A 60-year-old female patient presented with substernal chest pain. The nuclear stress test showed no reversible ischemia; however, right ventricle (RV) dilation was present. The patient underwent further evaluation for RV dilation with a transthoracic echocardiogram that demonstrated a complete absence of IAS and was confirmed by a positive bubble study. The patient had an invasive angiography that showed severely elevated RV pressure. Oxygen saturation in the right atrium was higher than in the inferior vena cava. Hence, an intracardiac shunt with a 10% increase in oxygen saturation was identified. It also identified aneurysmal coronary arteries (measuring 0.8 to 1.0 cm). Cardiac computed tomography angiogram was performed that identified all coronary arteries to be ectatic/aneurysmal measuring up to 8-10 mm, an absence of IAS, and a possible fistula between the distal left anterior descending and a coronary vein. To our knowledge, this is the first-ever presentation of a complete congenital absence of IAS in a patient who has survived into adulthood with the development of severe pulmonary hypertension without Eisenmenger syndrome. It is unclear at this point if surgical treatment to correct the anatomical defect (which would be probably palliative) would be superior to conservative medical therapy. Besides, the presence of coronary arteriovenous fistula would make the decision-making process more complex regarding surgical versus conservative management.Single or common atrium (CA) is a rare congenital abnormality arising due to a complete absence of the interatrial septum (IAS). It was initially thought to be an entity accompanied with endocardial cushion defect and was first described by Young and Robinson [1]. The CA can occur as part of skeletal and muscular malformation syndromes such as the Ellis-van Creveld syndrome [2]. There are few isolated cases of CA that have been reported in young adults; however, we report a case of an elderly woman with a single atrium accompanied with coronary arteriovenous fistula and coronary artery aneurysm.We present a case of a 60-year-old female who presented to the hospital with complaints of dull substernal chest pain. She had chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with home oxygen, osteoarthritis, and anxiety disorder as her comorbid conditions. On examination, she did have chronic dyspnea and was on home oxygen. She did not have any cyanosis, palpitations, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea.She was initially evaluated with a nuclear stress test that did not show any reversible ischemia but dilation of the right ventricle (RV); ejection fraction was identified to be 54%. The patient was further evaluated by a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in order to evaluate the RV dilatation. TTE identified a complete absence of IAS and a CA (Figure 1(a)). The findings were confirmed with a positive bubble study (Figure 1(b)). Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed that confirmed the absence of IAS, demonstrated free mixing of color flow, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, normal mitral valve structure, normal left ventricular ejection fraction, and enlarged right atrium (RA) and RV.The patient was evaluated with cardiac computed tomography angiogram (CCTA) that demonstrated the right coronary artery to be the dominant artery, all coronary arteries to be ectatic/aneurysmal and measuring up to 8-10 mm, a complete absence of IAS, marked dilation of CA and both ventricles, a coronary arteriovenous fistula (CAF) between the distal left anterior descending and coronary sinus, massive dilation of pulmonary arteries, and no mitral or aortic valvular abnormalities; left ventricular ejection fraction was measured to be 59% (Figures 2(a)–2(d)).The patient underwent an invasive angiography (IA) which demonstrated many abnormal findings. It showed that the patient had coronary artery aneurysms measuring 0.7 cm to 1 cm (Figure 3). IA was instrumental in taking measurements regarding oxygen saturation and pressure at multiple levels identifying a large interatrial shunt with a 10% increase in oxygen saturation from IVC to RA. IA measured RV pressure to be 98/5 mmHg denoting severe pulmonary hypertension, RV end-diastolic pressure at 12 mmHg, mean RA pressure as 10 mmHg, and left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure as 6 mmHg; oxygen saturation in the inferior vena cava (IVC) was 68.3%; oxygen saturation in RA was 79.8%; oxygen saturation in RV was 79.1%, and oxygen saturation in the femoral artery was 88%.The patient had survived into adulthood with these congenital abnormalities. The patient did not have any muscular, skeletal, ophthalmologic, or vascular abnormalities to signify that her abnormalities were part of any congenital syndrome. Cardiothoracic surgery had been consulted; however, due to the technical implications of surgery, the patient was managed conservatively with no intervention to correct the congenital abnormalities. The patient was not considered for a transcatheter approach of fixing the atrial septal defect as there was a complete absence of the septum. The decision to approach conservatively also included factors such as the age of the patient, comorbid conditions, and the ability of the patient to tolerate this defect (without Eisenmenger syndrome).The CA is a rare entity that has been classified as being part of the endocardial cushion defect. Rastelli et al. [3] described it as (1) complete absence of the atrial septum or its representation by a small strand of tissue present in the cephalad wall of the common chamber, (2) absence of interventricular communication, and (3) an accompanying cleft in the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Our case did not demonstrate any abnormality of the mitral valve and was confirmed with TEE.Levy et al. [4] reported CA as a specific and individual entity. They recommended that the term single or common atrium should be used to denote the condition characterized by (1) complete absence of the atrial septum, (2) absence of malformation of the AV valves, and (3) absence of interventricular communication.Patients who present with CA usually report symptoms that are related to the large atrial septal defect. They can present with dyspnea on exertion, hypoxia, cyanosis, and developmental delay. Patients mostly are diagnosed during early years; however, few case reports described patients progressing to young adulthood before being diagnosed with CA [5–10]. Echocardiography is usually the first step in diagnosing CA [10]. IA and further investigative methods do help in the evaluation of coexistent congenital abnormalities. Our case had a coronary arteriovenous fistula and coronary artery aneurysms. Our case had survived to 60 years of age before this congenital abnormality was discovered to be the cause of her chronic dyspnea. The patient had not been assessed by echocardiogram or any cardiologist prior to her current presentation for evaluation of intracardiac shunt even though she had developed pulmonary disease in adulthood without a significant history of chronic smoking.Coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) had been previously reported in 1.4% of postmortem examinations [11]. Due to routine use of IA, more cases of CAA have been diagnosed and reported. The incidence of coronary artery aneurysm has been reported to be 0.3% to 4.9% [12]. Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease accounts to be the etiology in the majority of cases [13]. Most of the patients remain asymptomatic; however, CAA does behave as arterial aneurysms elsewhere in the body and can lead to complications such as rupture, thrombus formation, and embolization. To the best of our knowledge, case reports in the literature have described the rupture of CAA if 3 cm or greater but no major case series or guidelines are established. There is also no significant consensus regarding the treatment of CAA due to the rarity of this condition and associated congenital abnormalities. Some cases in literature recommend antiplatelet along with anticoagulation to prevent thrombus formation whereas others recommend surgical resection and bypass graft surgery to prevent the risk of rupture [14].CAF is quite rare with an incidence of 0.13% to 0.22% in patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography [15, 16]. Common etiologies of CAF are congenital, trauma, cardiac surgery, and angioplasty. It is thought that fistulas more commonly arise from the right coronary artery or left anterior descending artery [17]. Approximately 40% of coronary fistulas drain to the right ventricle, 25%–48% to the right atrium, 17%–38% to the pulmonary artery, 7% to the coronary sinus, and 3%-8% to the left heart [15–20]. In our case, the fistula was arising from the left anterior descending artery and draining into the coronary sinus. Most of the cases remain asymptomatic during infancy and childhood but present later in adulthood due to complications arising from fistulas such as congestive heart failure (due to arterialization of coronary sinus), pulmonary hypertension, angina, or myocardial infarction arising due to coronary steal phenomenon [18]. The increased coronary flow through a fistulous artery adds to the shear stress which causes atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can further give rise to aneurysms further complicating the presentation of CAF. IA usually diagnoses CAF; however, multidimensional CCTA is evolving as a reliable noninvasive method of identifying CAF [21]. There is no clear guideline on the management of CAF; some recommend an observation policy for benign fistulas as there are reports of spontaneous closure; however, it is uncommon. Some suggest surgical therapy in order to prevent fistula-related complications [19].The overall prognosis of CA and absence of IAS is poor as patients who are unable to receive corrective surgery can develop pulmonary hypertension, hypoxia, heart failure, and arrhythmia. The primary objective of surgery is to reconstruct the atrial septum and correct associated congenital abnormalities. Early diagnosis is crucial as the development of Eisenmenger syndrome is a contraindication to surgery [10, 22].To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-ever case presentation of a complete absence of the atrial septum diagnosed at 60 years and accompanied with congenital malformations such as coronary artery aneurysm and coronary arteriovenous fistula.The mainstay therapy is surgery to correct the underlying congenital abnormality; however, due to other associated comorbidities and accompanied malformations, surgery can be challenging. As in our case, it is uncertain whether surgery is of any clear benefit versus conservative measures as the patient did survive till 60 years of age without any corrective measures.This case also highlights the importance of thorough workup to evaluate for the intracardiac shunt in a patient who has right heart enlargement and development of pulmonary disease in adulthood without a significant history of chronic smoking.This case has been presented at the State ACC Meeting 2014 at Charleston, WV.The authors report no financial relationships or conflicts of interest regarding the content herein.The case was done at the Department of Internal Medicine, Charleston Area Medical Center–WVU, Charleston, WV.
Cardiac Excrescences of Unusual Origin

In total, less than 50 known cases have been reported since first being discovered over 30 years ago. They are typically benign lesions; however, there has been a reported case of cardiac MICE being responsible for severe cardiopulmonary compromise and another case of the lesion embolizing leading to cerebral infarctions and ultimately death. Cardiac papillary fibroelastomas are also uncommon lesions found in the heart though they are not as rare as cardiac MICE. They are also benign and are typically attached to valvular surfaces; however, they also can be found as mobile masses. Just as cardiac MICE, they are capable of causing turbulent flow and thrombus formation and have been reported as the cause of ischemic events due to their ability to embolize. We present a case of cardiac MICE and cardiac papillary fibroelastoma in an individual who initially presented with neurologic symptoms concerning for a cerebrovascular accident. The patient was found to have a left ventricular mass composed of both cardiac MICE and cardiac papillary fibroelastomas.Cardiac masses are frequently noted on echocardiogram studies; however, primary neoplastic cardiac tumors are rare. The most frequent etiology of cardiac masses is either a normal variant or a result of an infectious etiology, such as infective endocarditis. The most common cause of a primary cardiac tumor is a myxoma; the second most common is a cardiac lipoma. In spite of being rare, primary cardiac tumors are often thought of, but rarely proven to be, the cause of an embolic event in patients.Cardiac MICE is a rare primary cardiac mass and is typically a benign incidental finding noticed either through imaging of the heart, invasive cardiac procedures, or at the time of an autopsy. They are solid lesions and are a hypercellular admixture of mesothelial cell clusters, with some degree of mesothelial hyperplasia, histiocytes, fibrin, and macrophages. This mixture is embedded within abundant fibrin, and there are large aggregates of histiocytes and strips of bland mesothelial cells [1, 2].Their exact origin is not yet confirmed; however, two theories exist to explain their existence. The first hypothesis attests that they are originated by damage to the endocardium, due to trauma or an invasive process such as cardiac catheterization [1–4]. A second hypothesis holds that they are iatrogenically deposited during a cardiac intervention. The masses have most frequently been found in the left cardiac chambers and have been predominantly reported in the left ventricle or on the valves themselves. However, there have been cases describing cardiac MICE in multiple other areas in the heart such as free floating in the left atrium, within an ascending aortic aneurysm, pericardial sac, celiac artery, atrioventricular groove, and right atrium [1, 5].Cardiac papillary fibroelastomas are rare and are the third most common primary cardiac tumors. They also are found primarily through imaging of the heart, most commonly echocardiography, as well as incidentally during surgery or autopsy. In the majority of the cases of cardiac papillary fibroelastoma, the lesion is found on a valvular surface, most often in the left side of the heart. It has most commonly been reported on the aortic valve (close to half of the time), followed by the mitral valve, then the tricuspid valve, and finally the pulmonary valve. Their origin and pathogenesis are currently not completely understood, but they are hypothesized to be the result of organization of fibrin deposits in the endocardium. As with cardiac MICE, they are free moving masses and therefore have the capability to embolize causing potentially catastrophic events [3, 6].Here, we discuss the case of an individual who, after presenting with symptoms concerning for a cerebrovascular accident, was found to have a mass in her left ventricle. Pathologic analysis revealed tissue consistent with cardiac MICE and cardiac papillary fibroelastoma.The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a past medical history of diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and coronary artery disease. Her past surgical history is significant for the placement of three coronary stents, which were placed on three separate occasions, the most recent having been placed 6 years prior. The patient initially presented to her primary care physician with “occasional shakes,” which were concerning for a transient ischemic attack. After detecting a carotid bruit on exam, the patient was sent for a bilateral carotid Doppler exam which revealed right carotid artery stenosis. Shortly after this, an echocardiogram was preformed which revealed a 2.0 cm x 0.5 cm mass in the left ventricular outflow tract. The patient was then sent to our institution for further evaluation. After the initial evaluation, the patient was scheduled for carotid endarterectomy.The surgery was uneventful; however, after the procedure, the patient sustained a cerebrovascular accident. Imaging of the brain suggested an embolic etiology for the cerebrovascular accident, and the patient underwent an echocardiogram to rule out the possibility of a cardiac origin for the embolus. The echocardiogram showed a large mobile mass attached to the undersurface of the posterior mitral apparatus with extension into the left ventricular outflow tract. Additional findings included severe mitral annular calcification, mild to moderate central mitral valve regurgitation with calcified mitral leaflets, calcified trileaflet aortic valve with normal opening, concentric left ventricular remodeling, and an ejection fraction of 70%.The mass was felt to be at a high risk for remobilization and was considered the cause of her recent cerebrovascular accident. Prior to removing the mass, the patient then underwent coronary angiography which showed severe stenosis of the left anterior descending artery as well as the ostial circumflex artery. Due to her past history of diabetes, as well as multiple vessel disease, the patient and physicians elected to proceed with double vessel coronary artery bypass grafting and concurrent excision of the mass. During the coronary artery bypass, the patient’s left anterior descending artery was bypassed using the left internal mammary artery and reversed saphenous vein graft was used to bypass the circumflex marginal branch. An intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram was completed to better visualize the mass. The findings were an approximately  calcified independently mobile echodensity attached to the ventricular side of the mitral annulus extending into the left ventricular outflow tract during ventricular systole. Additional findings included mitral annular calcification and mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, which were nearly identical to the preoperative echocardiogram. The mass was identified by the surgeon at its attachment with the subvalvular chordal apparatus of the posterior mitral leaflet. It was approximately 2.5 cm in diameter and consisted of soft yellowish material with several strands attached to it. Initially, it was thought to be, due to its appearance, either old endocarditis or degenerated calcium.The mass was resected without complications and sent for pathology. To rule out an infectious etiology of the mass, it was cultured and tested for the presence of acid fast bacilli, all of which were negative. Blood cultures were also sent at this time. The patient was placed on antibiotics due to the possibility of endocarditis, but they were discontinued shortly afterwards as the patient demonstrated no other signs of infection and was afebrile, and all blood cultures were negative. Unexpectedly, the pathology report returned with a diagnosis of cardiac MICE and papillary fibroelastoma. Both of these components comprised the mass that was resected. The patient was discharged and, to date, is alive and doing well.Our case highlights the unexpected pathologic diagnosis of cardiac MICE. On echocardiography, it is not possible to diagnose cardiac MICE separately from fibroelastoma especially as in this case where the portions/components of the mass were contiguous. In our case, the diagnosis of cardiac MICE was unexpected and was made based on the pathologic analysis of the resected specimen. It is the pathologic findings that allow for the differentiation on the histological level of cardiac MICE from fibroelastoma.Mesothelial/monocytic incidental cardiac excrescences were first reported in 1979. Due to their apparent origin, the endothelium and its morphologic similarity to histoid hemangiomas found at other locations were initially described as histiocytoid hemangiomas [5, 7–9]. Prior to their discovery, in 1975, Rosai and Dehner reported extravascular lesions, found in 13 different hernia sacs, whose composition was similar to that of MICE and were described as nodular mesothelial hyperplasia. Since that time, additional cases detailing similar lesions have been reported in the pleural and abdominal cavities [10]. In 1997, Chan et al. reported pathologic findings in the pleural cavity and considered the lesions to be nodular mesothelial hyperplasia, induced by inflammatory response as opposed to artifacts, and speculated that a similar hyperplastic change of the mesothelial cells might also occur in the pericardial cavity [7].The actual term cardiac MICE was not first proposed until a 1994 case report describing four cases resembling a histiocytoid hemangioma was discovered while retrospectively examining surgical pathology files from 1970 to 1992 [1]. Immunohistochemistry concluded that their composition was that of cuboidal cells (exhibiting cytokeratin positivity) and histiocytes (exhibiting CD68 positivity), and examination of the cells for malignancy, by a use of carcinoembryonic antigen and Leu-M1, was negative, leading to the conclusion that the lesions were of benign origin. Additionally, as three out of the four cases had undergone cardiac catheterization, it was first postulated that the lesions were of an iatrogenic nature and in some way related to these previous interventions [1, 11–13].Since that time, a 2008 article on cardiac MICE reported that the known number of cases were 35, though the true number of cases is uncertain and likely underreported [3]. As more cases of cardiac MICE surfaced, their epidemiology became more complex, but patterns started to emerge. The lesions have typically been found in the left cardiac chambers, with the masses predominantly being detected in the left ventricle or on the valves themselves; however, they have also been reported as free floating in the left atrium, within an ascending aortic aneurysm, pericardial sac, celiac artery, atrioventricular groove, and right atrium [1, 5, 14, 15].Pathologically, cardiac MICE (Figure 1) are solid lesions and are a hypercellular admixture of mesothelial cell clusters, with some degree of mesothelial hyperplasia and histiocytes. This mixture is embedded within abundant fibrin, and there are large aggregates of histiocytes and strips of bland mesothelial cells [1, 2].The origin of cardiac MICE remains up for debate, but two leading theories have arisen to explain their existence, although it is necessary to mention that neither theory by itself is sufficient to fully account for and accurately describe all reported cases of cardiac MICE.The first theory to be described referred to as the “reactive” theory suggests that these lesions arise secondary to trauma, most often of an iatrogenic etiology. It has been proposed that, after the initial injury to the endocardium occurs, the mesothelial cells are exposed to the bloodstream and aggregate with histiocytes and fibrin beginning the formation of the mass. At least one other case has also been presented that supports the involvement of the adhesion cell process [4, 7, 16]. Of the reported cases of cardiac MICE, a number of them describe cases in which prior instrumentation preceded their discovery and support the reactive theory. It is hypothesized that it was this trauma or microperforation during the instrumentation that lead to mesothelial cell hyperplasia and cell ingrowth from pericardium to endocardium and the development of the lesion [2].Though prior cardiac intervention is the most common cause of endothelial trauma thus setting into place the chain of events that lead to cardiac MICE formation, at least one case has been reported with a unique underlying catalyst. In 1997, a case of a 38-year-old woman with cardiac MICE was described; although she had no prior cardiac interventions, she was discovered to have a lung adenocarcinoma which involved the hilum but not the pericardium. During surgery, a small fragment of free-floating tissue was found in the pericardial cavity. Upon pathological examination of the specimen, microscopic examination demonstrated a composite of cells indicative of cardiac MICE (clusters of histiocytes, mesothelial cells, and fibrin). In addition to these findings, the sample contained rare pleomorphic adenocarcinoma cells. These cells tested positive for stains confirming their underlying malignant composition. It was then proposed that the surrounding mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and fibrin were formed in response to the invasion of the pericardial space by the adenocarcinoma [2]. In addition, it has been postulated that cardiac MICE may have been induced at least partially by the procoagulant activity of invasive adenocarcinoma. This case again alludes to the concept that adhesion molecules or an adhesive process may play a role in the process [4, 16].An alternative to the reactive theory is often described as the “artifactual” theory and postulates that cardiac MICE is merely an amalgamation of debris iatrogenically deposited during an invasive cardiac procedure [3, 17]. In 1994, Courtice et al. reported cases of cardiac MICE in which perforation of major cardiac structures at catheterization had not been found in their subject patients [17]. For their study, they examined a material found in extracorporeal bypass pumps and a material adherent to mediastinal and pericardial drains. They found samples consistent with cardiac MICE in 18 of 22 cases of extracorporeal bypass pump filters investigated, and 2 of 15 of mediastinal and pericardial drains following cardiac surgery. They and others suggested that lesions produced during cardiac surgery by the cardiotomy suction and compaction of friable mesothelial strips and other tissue debris and fibrin into tumor-like fragments, may be transported around the operative site on the suction tip. The fragments that are not removed from the cardiac chambers after an intervention are transferred by the suction catheter tips to the intravascular space during heart surgery, and the cellular components may aggregate and form a free-floating mass in the heart [14, 15, 17].Although most often thought of as an incidental finding, there has been at least one reported case of cardiac MICE causing severe acute cardiopulmonary failure [4]. The patient presented with what initially seemed like a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation but decompensated due to severe acute pulmonary edema which was believed to be secondary to severe aortic regurgitation. Prior to the patient’s acute decompensation, a transthoracic echocardiogram was completed which showed a 2.0 cm mobile mass on the aortic valve prolapsing into the left ventricular outflow tract. The patient underwent aortic valve repair, and in addition to the mass being visualized on the aortic valve, a soft tissue mass was seen free-floating in the left ventricular outflow tract. Perforation of the left coronary leaflet and adjacent erosion of the endocardium were also noted. Contrary to all previous cases, cardiac MICE in this instance was not incidental, rather it was responsible for the severe acute aortic valve regurgitation, obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, and ultimately the patient’s severe pulmonary edema and decompensation [4].Cardiac papillary fibroelastomas are a rare cause of primary cardiac tumors, and studies have estimated that there are approximately 200 cardiac tumors in every 1 million autopsies preformed. Cardiac papillary fibroelastomas are responsible for approximately 7% of all primary cardiac tumors [6, 18–20]. A 2003 report reviewing a total of 725 cases of cardiac papillary fibroelastomas showed that 55% of the patients were male, and although the lesion was most commonly found in the 8th decade of life, there were 10 cases that were reported in children under the age of ten. Of note, the oldest patient was 92 years of age and the youngest case was reported in a newborn child. After analysis of the cases, no clear risk factor was identified for development of cardiac papillary fibroelastomas [6].Similar to cardiac MICE, cardiac papillary fibroelastomas (Figure 2) are solid lesions most often found on the valves of the heart, and there are multiple theories that exist to suggest their origin. They have been hypothesized to be caused by turbulent blood flow across the endocardium, inflammation, and true neoplasms [21]. Histologically, cardiac papillary fibroelastomas are covered with endothelium that surrounds a layer of acid mucopolysaccharide, and they possess an inner vascular core composed of connective tissue. The connective tissue matrix that comprises the fibroelastoma is a collection of collagen, smooth muscle cells, and elastic fibers [20].In the vast majority of the cases, nearly 80%, the lesion was found on the valvular surface, most often on the aortic valve (close to half of the time), followed by the mitral valve, then the tricuspid valve, and finally the pulmonary valve. The majority of the cases found that the mass was located in the left heart (>95% of the cases), and therefore, systemic embolization is frequent. Most often incidental findings, the manifestations of cardiac papillary fibroelastomas vary greatly, but the most common presenting manifestation was embolization to systemic, coronary, or cerebral circulation. Other initial presenting symptoms varied and included angina, syncope, and myocardial infarction and sudden death [6].Cardiac papillary fibroelastomas are most often identified incidentally by echocardiography but other modalities, such as cardiac MRI and cardiac CT, have also been utilized [6]. They have also been incidentally discovered during cardiac catheterization, cardiac surgery, and autopsy [22]. Due to the potential catastrophic events that both cardiac MICE and cardiac papillary fibroelastomas have been associated with, such as sudden death, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction, excision is the recommended treatment. In symptomatic patients, all previous studies have suggested that excision is the preferred treatment and should be offered to all patients who are candidates. Surgery is curative and has been shown to improve both the long and short term prognosis, and recurrence has yet to be reported in regard to both lesions [6]. If the patient is not a candidate for surgery, oral anticoagulation is the recommended treatment for cardiac papillary fibroelastomas, but there have been no randomized controlled trials to date on the efficacy of this treatment [6, 23, 24]. No previous studies have been conducted, and no interventions currently exist for cardiac MICE in patients that are not surgical candidates. Additionally, as mentioned, the challenge remains the difficulty in the echocardiographic diagnosis of cardiac MICE which leads to the necessity of cardiac MICE diagnosis based on the histopathologic specimen analysis of the resected mass.This case illustrates a rare case of a lesion comprised of both cardiac MICE and cardiac papillary fibroelastoma. To our knowledge, although they have been presented separately, there has never been a case reported of a mass consisting of both cardiac MICE and cardiac papillary fibroelastoma. Additionally, there have been very few cases of cardiac MICE embolizing causing systemic symptoms. In the case of our patient, the likely origin of her neurologic symptoms was an embolic event caused by her left ventricular mass. The patient did have a history of prior cardiac instrumentation as she underwent cardiac catheterization on three separate occasions which would support the reactive theory of cardiac MICE and potentially an inflammatory/reactive etiology of cardiac papillary fibroelastomas.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Noninvasive Recanalization of a Coronary Chronic Total Occlusion

Spontaneous recanalization of a chronically occluded artery is rare and reported anecdotally. Case Summary. We report a case of a patient with a chronically occluded right coronary artery, found on a coronary angiography performed due to acute ST elevation myocardial infarction with an occluded circumflex artery as a culprit lesion. Three months later, a follow-up angiography was performed and a recanalization of the occluded right coronary artery was detected. Discussion. There is a possibility that intrinsic fibrinolytic mechanisms with the additional effect of standard antithrombotic drugs administrated after the acute coronary event led to the recanalization.Chronic total occlusion (CTO) of a coronary artery is defined as an  weeks with well-developed collaterals which may provide flow equivalent to a flow obtained in an artery with 90-95% stenosis, preventing myocardial ischemia [1–4]. Although a spontaneous recanalization can occur in the acute myocardial infarction caused by a thrombotic event, it is a rare event in CTOs, especially in native coronary arteries occluded by a solid fibrocalcific plaque. We report a case of a female patient with a spontaneously recanalized CTO of the right coronary artery (RCA).A 67-year-old woman with a history of asthma presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with chest pain lasting 3 hours before admission. The 12-lead ECG revealed myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation (STEMI) (elevation present in the inferior and V5/V6 leads) (Figures 1(a)–1(c)). The patient was hemodynamically stable with normal blood pressure and Killip status I. After applying a bolus dose of acetylsalicylic acid (300 mg) and ticagrelor (180 mg) orally, an urgent coronary angiography was performed which showed a middle segment left circumflex artery (LCx) occlusion and a collateralized total occlusion of the proximal segment of RCA. Three drug-eluting stents (DES) were implanted in the LCx, and due to unsatisfactory postprocedural TIMI flow (TIMI I), GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor eptifibatide was applied after the procedure (180 mcg/kg as a IV bolus—15,3 mg, followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mcg/kg/min up to 75 mg of eptifibatide in total) (Figures 2–4). Postprocedural ECG revealed satisfactory ST segment resolution, and the patient had no chest pain. Laboratory tests revealed elevation of cardioselective markers (admission values: hsTI 51 ng/L and creatine kinase 106 U/L; peak values during hospitalization, 18 hours after the intervention: hsTI 24100 ng/L and creatine kinase 1348 U/L). Echocardiography during the first day after procedure showed a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (50%) with a inferoposterior wall hypokinesis, with no other significant pathology. The patient was treated with beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and statin permanently as well as with a 100 IU/kg dose of low-molecule heparin (enoxaparin) twice a day during the first 4 days. On the 5th day of the hospitalization, the patient reported nonspecific chest discomfort, without cardioselective enzyme reelevation, but due to nonspecific changes in the inferior leads of the ECG, the new onset of the ischemia could not be excluded, so the coronary angiography was repeated. The second coronary angiography revealed CTO of the RCA and an in-stent thrombosis with occlusion of stents in LCx (Figure 5). Due to unsuccessful recanalization of the LCx using the guidewire and the TIMI I flow at the end of the first procedure, optimal anti-ischemic therapy was proposed including isosorbide-mononitrate, trimetazidine, ranolazine, in addition to ticagrelor, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), nebivolol, ramipril, and atorvastatin. After the following four days of uneventful hospitalization, the patient was discharged with chronic therapy which included all the abovementioned medications. Three months later, at the planned outpatient follow-up visit, the patient presented with stable angina pectoris symptoms during moderate physical activity and a new coronary angiography was scheduled. After admission, coronary angiography was performed showing a spontaneous recanalization of the RCA, with a nonsignificant stenosis of the proximal-to-middle RCA segment, a 50% stenosis of the posterior descending artery, and no collaterals from left anterior descending artery (LAD) as well as persistent in-stent occlusion in the LCx with new collaterals from the first marginal artery (Figure 6). Dobutamine stress echocardiography was performed the day after the coronary angiography, showing no ischemia progression during testing in the RCA- and LCx-supplied myocardium. Due to stress echocardiography finding, no coronary intervention was indicated. Medical therapy was continued after dose optimization (80 mg of isosorbide-mononitrate daily instead of 40 mg and 1000 mg of ranolazine daily instead of 750 mg). Before discharge, an optimal ECG stress test was performed and no pain or ECG signs of ischemia were reported.We report a noninvasive CTO recanalization of the RCA. According to available data, a spontaneous recanalization of chronically occluded coronary arteries has been described anecdotally [5, 6]. All the cases (including ours) described CTO recanalization of the right coronary artery in the 60-year-old women. The majority of cases described CTO recanalization of carotid and peripheral arteries followed by discussion about the underlying mechanism [7–9]. In comparison to the reported cases with spontaneous CTO coronary artery recanalization, there are several specificities of our case. Firstly, no significant residual stenosis at the site of the previous CTO was noted, except a nonsignificant proximal-to-middle segment stenosis of the RCA [5, 6]. Secondly, the stimulation of the intrinsic fibrinolytic pathway by the anoxic tissue has been proposed as an underling mechanism of the discussed phenomenon [9]. In the reported case, acute therapy with low-molecule heparin and the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor eptifibatide did not affect the chronic occlusion which was confirmed by a control angiography performed 5 days after the acute infarction. However, the addition of dual antiplatelet therapy in a chronic setting may be added a synergistic effect to intrinsic mechanisms and led to the recanalization in less than three months. It raises the question why the CTO was recanalized and the stents remained occluded. The fact that stents are “foreign” objects in the coronary arteries with a chance of acute and chronic thrombosis supports the hypothesis that thrombosis activated intrinsic fibrinolytic pathways, but stents in the LCx encouraged the thrombosis or made it difficult to intrinsic fibrinolysis to make the artery patent again. Thirdly, there is a suspicion that the RCA was a culprit lesion of the acute infarction. However, there are few arguments against the RCA occlusion as a culprit infarction lesion: the initial ECG showed a inferolateral ST segment elevation with a slightly higher elevation in the 2nd standard lead (II) than in the 3rd lead, without a significant “mirror” ST segment denivelation in the 1st standard lead and without elevation in the right precordial leads (RV4) (Figures 1(a)–1(c)); no ischemic pain and satisfactory ST segment resolution were present after the acute intervention on the LCx occlusion; there were already existing collaterals from LAD to RCA; and no medically induced reperfusion of the RCA occlusion was obtained (confirmed by a control angiography 5 days after the index event) after applying ticagrelor, acetylsalicylic acid, eptifibatide, and low-molecule heparin in the acute setting. It is possible that excessive antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy gave a “bite” to the chronic occlusion of the RCA, leading to the intrinsic fibrinolytic mechanism and medical thrombotic suppression to melt the chronic occlusion. On the other hand, stopping the heparin and GPII/IIIa therapy in a still acute prothrombotic milieu led to thrombosis of the three implanted stents in the LCx. Additionally, it remains unclear why the patient reported angina between two hospitalizations, especially after performing a stress echocardiography where no ischemia progression was found. There might be an angiographic undetectable underlying microvascular disease which symptoms’ regression can be related to the therapy changes (control ECG stress test revealed no ECG signs of ischemia nor clinical AP symptoms). Although intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) would have provided useful information, we were not able to perform it due to the reimbursement issues. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium could not have been performed due to unavailability of the method in our hospital as well as the contraindication of adenosine administration due to the patient’s history of asthma. In addition, another option could explain this sequence of events—prolonged coronary artery spasm which was repeated during the first two coronary angiographies. There are several facts pointing to the unlikelihood of spasm: presence of occlusion on two consecutive angiographies with 5-day difference while the patient was on full anti-ischemic therapy including nitrates and presence of collaterals to RCA supplying territory, no evidence of dynamic component of stenosis in angiograms during two different angiographies, as well as no evidence of spasm tendency on the third angiography. However, acetylcholine or ergonovine test during the last angiography, when RCA was found patent, which could have revealed the possibility of coronary artery spasm, was unfortunately not done [10, 11]. Lamm et al. [6] suggested that CTO is not a definitive state and collateral formation is just a bypass to the natural occlusion resolution. Perhaps it happens more often than we know because CTO patients are often treated with medications and usually no control angiographies are performed routinely. We hope that our data will help other authors to understand better the patho(physio)logy of the described unusual finding and encourage new basic studies in this area.The patient has signed the informed consent.The authors report no conflicts of interest.
Successful Resolution of a Large Left Atrial and Left Atrial Appendage Thrombus with Rivaroxaban

The patient had history of atrial fibrillation and was planned for cardioversion. Preprocedure transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed a large multilobulated mobile thrombus in the left atrial appendage. The patient refused warfarin therapy and instead chose to take rivaroxaban. Upon outpatient follow-up, 3 months later, no visible thrombus was appreciated on repeat TEE. This case demonstrates successful resolution of left atrial and left atrial appendage thrombi with the use of rivaroxaban. At present time, limited data is available to support the use of rivaroxaban for treatment of intracardiac thrombi. This case highlights the need for further studies to investigate the outcomes and relative efficiency of use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in lysis of intracardiac thrombus. The benefits of DOACs compared to the standard of therapy could increase patient compliance, reduce length of stay, and improve treatment efficacy.Atrial fibrillation is an ever-growing global problem, with an estimated 2.7-6.1 million affected in the United States and roughly 33.5 million affected worldwide [1]. Left atrial abnormalities, such as dilated left atrium and reduced left atrial and/or left atrial appendage blood flow, are independent risk factors for development of thromboembolism [2, 3]. In order to estimate the annual minimal risk of a thromboembolic event in these patients, we use the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring tool. Anticoagulation therapy helps to mitigate the risks of thromboembolic events and specifically in cases of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) [4, 5]. In cases of left atrial or left atrial appendage (LA/LAA) thrombus, current guidelines recommend vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy [6–10]. Here, we describe a successful resolution of left atrial and left atrial appendage thrombus with use of rivaroxaban.A 79-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (CHA2DS2-VASc , only on Aspirin), type 2 diabetes mellitus, and right lower extremity leiomyosarcoma with lymphedema of the affected limb treated with surgical resection and radiotherapy presented to the emergency department with exertional dyspnea, worsening of lower extremity edema, and weight gain. On arrival vitals shows blood pressure 140/95, heart rate 80, and SpO2 98. Physical examination was remarkable for irregular heartbeat, decreased bilateral lung sounds, and bilateral grade 3+ lower extremity edema up to the sacrum. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed atrial fibrillation with new left bundle branch block (LBBB) (Figure 1). The laboratory workup was significant for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 2,233 pg/ml, troponin 0.38 ng/ml, and d-dimer 1.81 mg/l. Otherwise, he had normal basic metabolic panel (BMP) and complete blood count (CBC). Chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed cardiomegaly and moderate pleural effusion in bilateral lung fields (Figure 2).Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% and severe global hypokinesis. Coronary angiogram revealed minimal coronary artery disease. The patient was diagnosed with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and was treated with lisinopril, metoprolol, spironolactone, diuretics, and enoxaparin. Despite medical management, he remained in atrial fibrillation for which he was scheduled for rhythm restoration with transesophageal echocardiogram- (TEE-) guided DC cardioversion (DCCV). TEE revealed a large multilobulated mobile thrombus in the left atrial appendage, and sessile irregular echogenic material attached to the wall of the left atrium was visualized (Figure 3(a)). Accordingly, cardioversion was aborted. The patient refused anticoagulation with Coumadin therapy and instead opted for rivaroxaban, aware of risks of possible anticoagulation failure or adverse events, as he would not be on standard of therapy. The patient was discharged with guideline-directed management for coronary artery disease and heart failure as well as rivaroxaban 20 mg daily. On subsequent outpatient follow-up three months later, repeat TEE showed no visible thrombus (Figure 3(b)). No evidence of clinical thromboembolic events was noted between initial and follow-up encounters.Standard of therapy for stroke prophylaxis in setting of LA/LAA/intracardiac thrombus in patients with NVAF is vitamin K antagonist (VKA) oral anticoagulation [6–10]; however, there is limited data regarding the use and clinical outcomes of direct thrombin inhibitors (DOACs) for diagnosed thrombus in LA/LAA. The ROCKET-AF trial evaluated the treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with the direct oral factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban) compared with warfarin. Rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism in NVAF patients [11]. Among patients excluded were those with mitral valve stenosis, prosthetic valves, and left ventricular thrombus; however, there is no specific mention of inclusion or exclusion of LA/LAA thrombus. Investigators commented that patients in the warfarin group were in the therapeutic INR range, a mean of 55% of the time [11].According to the 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [12], in patients with atrial -hour duration (or unknown) provided TEE negative for thrombi, the initiation of DOACs can be considered with at least a single DOAC  hours before electrical or pharmacological cardioversion. Otherwise, an alternative strategy would be initiating DOAC therapy for at least 3 weeks prior to cardioversion. After cardioversion, continuous oral anticoagulation is mandatory for at least another 4 weeks, irrespective of the CHA2DS2-VASc score [7]. One prospective open-label multicenter study by Lip et al. (X-TRA study) explored the use of vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulation for the treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation/flutter with documented LA/LAA thrombi on TEE [13]. This was based on the 2015 CLOT AF registry which with a total of 156 sample sizes in ITT population at 23 institutions among 7 European country [14] findings from the X-TRA showed that resolved or reduced thrombus after rivaroxaban treatment was evident and consistent with LA/LAA thrombus resolution with VKA therapy, suggesting that rivaroxaban maybe a potential treatment option for LA/LAA thrombi in patients with NVAF or atrial flutter [13].Warfarin inhibits the hepatic synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors by preventing extension of existing thrombi and de novo thrombosis [8]. Limitations for use of warfarin among cardiac patients who require anticoagulation therapy include a narrow therapeutic range, food and drug interactions, and unpredictable pharmacokinetics requiring regular and frequent International Normalized Ratio (INR) checks [15]. Failure of adequate anticoagulation can lead to progression of thromboembolism, hemorrhage, repeated hospital admissions, necessitation of more invasive procedures such as placement of a left atrial appendage closure device, increased cost burden, and increased risks of morbidity and mortality [9, 16, 17].Rivaroxaban is approved for the reduction in risk of stroke for NVAF, primary and secondary venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxes, and treatment of VTE; however, limited data and literature have been reported to establish the use or efficacy of DOACs on established left-sided intracardiac thrombus and its outcomes. This case demonstrates successful resolution of LA/LAA thrombi on DOAC therapy, specifically rivaroxaban. If enough clinical data supports DOAC relative efficacy in lysis of LA/LAA/intracardiac thrombus, the benefits of DOAC compared to the standard of therapy could increase patient compliance, reduce length of stay, and improve treatment efficacy.At present time, there is limited data on DOACs or factor Xa inhibitors in cases of diagnosed left atrial/left atrial appendage/intracardiac thrombi. Ideally, a well-designed randomized clinical trial to provide meaningful data and guidance as to the use of DOACs for such cases.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Quadricuspid Aortic Valve: Report of Two Cases and Brief Review

Even rarer is its clinical presentation with aortic stenosis. Diagnosis of QAV could be challenging but is of great importance as patients often present with progressive aortic regurgitation. We present 2 cases of QAV presenting differently: one with aortic stenosis requiring valve replacement and the other with aortic regurgitation requiring close monitoring.62-year-old woman with medical history significant for aortic stenosis and chronic atrial fibrillation presented to the emergency department with fatigue and progressively worsening shortness of breath with minimal exertion. She was asymptomatic at rest and denied chest pain, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg swelling, presyncope, or syncope. She was incidentally found to have a systolic murmur during her pregnancy 20 years prior to this presentation. Notably, she had been offered aortic valve replacement in the past but declined.Vital signs were normal with blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 79/min, temperature of 97.2°F, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min with normal oxygen saturation of 100% on ambient air. Physical examination was significant for irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and ejection systolic murmur was loudest in the aortic area with radiation to the carotids. Her lungs were clear to auscultation, and no pedal edema was noted. Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Her most recent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a thickened calcified aortic valve with decreased excursion with 4.6 m/s velocity suggesting a peak of 86 mmHg and mean of 36 mmHg suggestive of severe aortic stenosis. No other significant valvular abnormalities noted. Cardiac catheterization revealed widely patent coronary arteries.Based on the presence of worsening symptoms and the risk of sudden cardiac death, the decision was made to proceed with surgical aortic valve replacement. Given her history of chronic atrial fibrillation, she was also planned for left atrial appendage exclusion and Cox Maze IV procedure simultaneously with the aortic valve replacement. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed quadricuspid aortic valves confirmed during surgical exploration (Figure 1). The native stenotic quadricuspid aortic valve leaflets were excised, and a 21 mm Saint Jude Medical Trifecta valve was implanted. The left atrial appendage was excised, and Cox Maze IV procedure was performed. Postoperatively, she remained in junctional rhythm and underwent uneventful placement of the dual chamber pacemaker on postoperative day 3. She recovered without further complications and was discharged on the eight postoperative day.53-year-old female with past medical history of aortic regurgitation and hypertension presented to the cardiology office for routine follow-up. She denied chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, dyspnea, or leg swelling. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs. Cardiac auscultation revealed diastolic murmur loudest at the 3rd left intercostal space. The remainder of physical examination was unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) 3 months earlier revealed a trileaflet aortic valve with moderate aortic insufficiency. TTE also noted a poorly defined subaortic membrane which prompted further assessment of valve anatomy by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which confirmed the presence of quadricuspid aortic valve with severe aortic regurgitation from incomplete coaptation of the valve leaflets. Given that she was asymptomatic, we planned to continue surveillance by clinical and echocardiographic monitoring.The normal aortic valve is trileaflet and with the pulmonary valve represents the two semilunar heart valves. The leaflets, namely, right coronary, left coronary, and noncoronary cusps, are named based on their relationship to the coronary arteries [1]. Anatomical variations of the aortic valve have been documented notably, the unicuspid, bicuspid, and quadricuspid valves. Of these variants, the bicuspid valve is the commonest followed by unicuspid valve [2]. Quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) is a rare congenital anomaly with documented incidence of 0.008% by autopsy, 0.043% by transthoracic echocardiogram, and 1% intraoperatively during aortic valve surgery [3, 4]. While both of our patients were female, it has been shown to have a slightly higher male preponderance [5] with mean age of presentation between 46 and 50 years. The embryology of QAV remains poorly understood, but it is believed to result from aberrant division of one of the three mesenchymal ridges that normally gives rise to three aortic valve cushions [6, 7]. Acquired heart diseases such as infective endocarditis and rheumatic fever may contribute to the development of a false QAV, but the absence of corpus arantii (nodules of semilunar cusps) helps to distinguish true congenital from an acquired QAV [8].Hurwitz and Roberts described the seven (A–G; Figure 2) most common anatomic variants of QAV based on the size of the valve leaflets [9]. Type A has 4 equal cusps, type B has 3 normal cusp and a small accessory cusp, and type C has 2 large cusps and 2 small cusps. Types A and B represent about 73% of all the cases of QAV [10]. Other classification systems exist based on the position of the accessory cusps as described by Nakamura et al. [11] (Figure 3). In type I, the supernumerary cusp lies between the left and right coronary cusps. In type II, it lies between the right and noncoronary cusps. In type III, it lies between the left and noncoronary cusps, and in type IV, the supernumerary cusp cannot be identified as there are 2 equal sized smaller cusps. It is important to note that the position of the accessory cusp has no effect on the severity of the valvular insufficiency [4, 12]. Based on these classifications, our first patient had Hurwitz type C and Nakamura type IV while the second patient likely has Hurwitz type A and Nakamura type I quadricuspid aortic valve.Quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) usually presents as an isolated congenital anomaly, but other associated cardiac anomalies have been reported in about 18-32% of cases including aortic root dilatation [13], tetralogy of Fallot [14], patent ductus arteriosus [15], atrial and ventricular septal defects [16, 17], and anomalous origin of the coronary arteries [12].Clinical presentation varies being mostly asymptomatic in the young, recall that both patients were asymptomatic until adulthood. The symptomatic patients will present with palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and feature of congestive heart failure. Cases of ischemic stroke as an initial presentation has been reported [18]. Patients with QAV mostly present with aortic insufficiency and less commonly aortic stenosis [5]. More than half will present in adulthood with features of aortic insufficiency and more than 50% will require aortic valvular replacement in the sixth and seventh decade of life due to worsening aortic regurgitation [2, 19]. Infective endocarditis occurs in 1.4% of these patients [8] depending on the Hurwitz classification and its effect on dynamics of blood flow across the valve as mechanical stress on the abnormal valves [20] is thought to play a key role.The routine use of echocardiography in suspected cases of valvular heart disease has allowed for early and accurate diagnosis of QAV. Although transthoracic echocardiography is often used in clinical settings, transesophageal echocardiography provides a more accurate assessment of valvular anatomy [8]. Magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography can also aid diagnosis, although not generally used solely for this purpose [18, 21]. In the absence of symptoms as described above, patients with QAV should be followed up closely. For symptomatic patients, treatment options range from valve repair to valve replacement. Repair may be feasible in some patients, but most will require valve replacement. Valve replacement, which could be surgical as in the first case described or transcatheter, is preferred in patients with severe aortic valvular dysfunction. Tricuspidalization is a preferred repair option in patients with Hurwitz types A, B, and C QAV [4].Quadricuspid aortic valve is a rare congenital cardiac defect usually diagnosed incidentally. While most patients develop aortic regurgitation later in life, some as reported in the first case develop aortic stenosis while others remain asymptomatic. Although there are no guideline-based approach to management, it is prudent to regularly follow up these patients for early signs of aortic valve dysfunction.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.Transthoracic echocardiogram (parasternal short axis view) clearly showing quadricuspid aortic valve.

An Unusual Case of Left Atrial Mural Thrombus following Aortic Valve Replacement

They are generally dissolved after a certain period of optimal anticoagulation. A large thrombus, on the other hand, may persist even with adequate anticoagulation. The surgical removal of a thrombus theoretically poses some risk of systemic embolization, making its management a clinical dilemma. Furthermore, a refractory thrombus is uncommon. Thus, an evidence-based guideline in selecting the optimal therapy is needed. We report a case of a 74-year-old male with atrial fibrillation and a history of unprovoked pulmonary embolism who was incidentally found to have a massive left atrial thrombus shortly after discontinuing warfarin about 4 months following bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. The thrombus was refractory to anticoagulation posing a clinical management dilemma. This case is interesting in terms of presentation and the approach to diagnosis and treatment.Left atrial thrombus (LAT) formation is a well-known complication of atrial fibrillation and rheumatic mitral valve disease. They carry a high risk for systemic thromboembolism; therefore, early detection and treatment should be established with a high index of suspicion [1]. The left atrial appendage is the most common location of the LAT; therefore, the appendage is usually ligated during open heart surgery. In terms of treatment, anticoagulation remains the preferred approach once LAT has been detected. We present a case of a 74-year-old male who developed a massive LAT shortly after discontinuing warfarin about 4 months following bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. The thrombus was also refractory to anticoagulation posing a clinical management dilemma.The patient is a 74-year-old Caucasian male with a history of atrial fibrillation, CHA2DS2-VASc score of 6, unprovoked deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism on long-term warfarin, who was initially found to have aortic stenosis (AS) in 2015 during preoperative cardiovascular evaluation for surgery on his right foot. His echocardiography at the time revealed moderate aortic stenosis (peak gradient of 32 mmHg, mean gradient of 22 mmHg), an ascending aorta diameter of 3.7 cm, and a severely enlarged left atrium (left atrial volume index of 66 mL/m2). His atrial fibrillation was controlled with propafenone and warfarin. Subsequently, his AS was followed clinically and echocardiographically every 6-12 months according to the guidelines.By the end of 2017, he developed a worsening dyspnea on exertion and persistent atrial fibrillation along with episodes of symptomatic bradycardia (heart rate in 30-40 s) for which he underwent pacemaker implantation. His echocardiography revealed worsening aortic stenosis; the calculated valve area was 0.8 cm2 with a peak gradient of 45 mmHg and a mean gradient of 27 mmHg. The left ventricular systolic function was mildly reduced with an ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%.Upon further evaluation which included transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE), it was felt that his clinical features were consistent with a low-flow, low-gradient severe AS. He was subsequently referred for evaluation for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).While awaiting TAVR, his symptoms continued to progress as he developed syncopal episodes. Furthermore, as part of his pre-TAVR evaluation, he underwent CT angiography of his chest which revealed a worsening of his ascending aortic aneurysm with an aortic root diameter measuring 4.6 cm (Figure 1). A shared decision was made to let him undergo open heart surgery to repair both pathologies. By February 2018, he underwent a successful complex surgical procedure with bioprosthetic AVR (27 mm Edwards Perimount Magna pericardial valve), ascending aortic aneurysmal repair (30 mm Hemashield tube graft), mitral valve repair (36 mm Edwards flexible annuloplasty), left-sided maze procedure, and left atrial appendage excision and ligation (the LAA was ligated at its base and excised, and the stump was oversewn in 2 layers using #4-0 prolene sutures). He was placed back on warfarin and aspirin. He was discharged after an uneventful hospital course with referral to our outpatient anticoagulation clinic and cardiac rehabilitation program.His anticoagulation was closely monitored. Four months later, however, he presented with persistent frank hematuria. A shared decision was made to stop his warfarin since it had been more than 3 months from his bioprosthetic valve replacement and more than 10 years from the onset of his lone PE. He was subsequently referred for further urological workup. Two months later, while his hematuria had resolved, it was accidentally discovered that he had a sizable left atrial thrombus upon undergoing surveillance CT chest imaging for his ascending aorta, which was further delineated using TEE (Figure 2). Subsequently, he was restarted back on warfarin with a heparin bridge, while no decision was made to pursue surgery.He had a follow-up TEE 4 months later which showed a very little to no change in the size of the thrombus despite adequate anticoagulation. Fortunately, there has not been any thromboembolic event up to date.A refractory left atrial thrombus is a clinical dilemma because of its risk of systemic complications and a lack of an evidence-based guideline in selecting optimal therapies. LAT is often associated with atrial fibrillation or rheumatic mitral valve stenosis. They account for >45% of cardiogenic thromboembolic events [1]. LAT often forms in the left atrial appendage (LAA) because of its shape and the presence of trabeculations. However, it can arise around the free atrial wall especially in cases of a dilated atrium. In our presented case, his left atrium was severely dilated; however, the left appendage was already excised. Based on the interrogation of his pacemaker, he had also been in sinus rhythm since the day of his pacemaker implantation.Thrombus formation in the left atrium after LAA exclusion has been previously reported with endocardial occlusion devices (Watchman, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts or Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (ACP), St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota). Its mechanism was mainly attributed to platelet aggregation in the setting of a foreign body in the left atrium [2, 3]. In the study by Lakkireddy et al., the risk for LA thrombus formation using a lariat device was discovered to be as low as 2%, mostly occurring within 90 days [4]. There are no published data regarding LA thrombus formation at postsurgical excision and ligation of the LAA as in our case.Our patient developed a massive thrombus despite taking both warfarin and aspirin. He had a history of atrial fibrillation but was in sinus rhythm for at least 6 months before the thrombus was detected (since the maze procedure). He is 74 years old, but he has no history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus. He did have one episode of DVT and pulmonary embolism along with a severely dilated left atrium which may have partly contributed to the development of the thrombus [5].In terms of management, various options including anticoagulation, thrombolytic treatment, endovascular intervention, and open surgery exist. Anticoagulation is generally considered as the first-line therapy. Even with the failure of medical management, there is little evidence either in favor of or against aggressive management to remove the thrombus [6]. In our patient, he was restarted on warfarin and surgical consultation was made; however, the latter was deferred.The left atrial thrombus is a known complication of atrial fibrillation and rheumatic mitral valve disease, especially in the setting of an enlarged left atrium. If not detected and properly treated, it can lead to devastating thromboembolic complications. Anticoagulation is usually the treatment of choice which usually results in the desolation of the thrombus; however, in some cases, LAT might be refractory to anticoagulation creating a decisional dilemma as in our presented case. More cases and effort are needed to have a standardized approach to treat this category of patients.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

We report a case of a 47-year-old Filipino female diagnosed with SLE 17 years ago maintained on prolonged oral steroids, azathioprine, and hydroxychloroquine. She also had lupus nephritis, secondary hypertension, and dyslipidemia. She initially presented with a week-long watery nonbloody diarrhea with associated diffuse crampy abdominal pain and generalized weakness. She was admitted for a week at a provincial hospital and was given an unrecalled antibiotic with resolution of symptoms. Upon discharge, however, she experienced two weeks of severe right lower quadrant pain radiating to the back and left lower quadrant, with no history of diarrhea, vomiting, dysuria, and fever. Complete blood count showed slight leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. Abdominal imaging revealed a saccular infrarenal aneurysm with dissection. An atherosclerotic mechanism was primarily considered, but a vasculitic process was likewise considered due to elevated acute phase reactants. The initial plan was Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) but due to financial limitations, an exploratory laparotomy with infrarenal endoaneurysmorrhaphy was eventually performed. Intraoperative findings were a saccular infrarenal aneurysm with dissection up to the proximal right common iliac artery and an abscess compartment within the false lumen in the anterior aortic wall. Abscess culture yielded high growth of Salmonella group B. Micrographs of the aortic wall biopsy showed fibrin deposition necrosis and calcification with peripheral viable cellular infiltrates consisting of neutrophils and foamy macrophages. Inadvertently placing an endovascular graft in an infected aortic aneurysm would have led to graft infection and catastrophic morbidity. We highlight the significance of having a high index of suspicion for infectious causes of aortitis among immunocompromised patients presenting with aneurysm prior to pursuing an endovascular versus an open approach for repair.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a multifaceted pathophysiology and multiorgan involvement. Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality complicating SLE [1]. However, diseases of the aorta, particularly aneurysms and dissections, among SLE patients are uncommonly reported [2].We report a case of a 47-year-old Filipino female diagnosed with SLE 17 years ago maintained on prolonged oral prednisone 10 mg/day, azathioprine, and hydroxychloroquine. She also had chronic kidney disease from lupus nephritis, secondary hypertension, and dyslipidemia. She was a nonsmoker.She initially presented with a week-long watery nonbloody diarrhea with associated diffuse crampy abdominal pain and generalized weakness. There was no fever nor vomiting. She was admitted for a week at a provincial hospital and was given an unrecalled antibiotic with resolution of symptoms. Upon discharge, however, she experienced severe right lower quadrant pain radiating to the back and left lower quadrant for two weeks, with no history of diarrhea, vomiting, dysuria, and fever. She was readmitted at the provincial hospital where diagnostics revealed anemia and urinary tract infection, for which she was transfused with packed red blood cell units and given unrecalled intravenous antibiotics, respectively. Blood cultures were initially negative. Abdominal imaging revealed bilateral renal parenchymal disease and an infrarenal aortic aneurysm. Appendicitis was ruled out by symptomatology and imaging. She was then transferred to our institution for surgical repair of the aneurysm.During her admission at the surgical ward, antihypertensive medications were titrated to keep her blood pressures less than 120/80. Prednisone was given at 1 mg/kg/day. Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg OD, mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg BID, and atorvastatin 40 mg OD were continued. She continued to have intermittent abdominal pain. There was no fever, overt bleeding, dysuria, or recurrence of diarrhea. Complete blood count showed slight leukocytosis, and the C-reactive protein was elevated. A computed tomography (CT) aortogram revealed an infrarenal aneurysm with signs of dissection and retroperitoneal hematoma formation, indicative of leakage (see Figures 1–3). Given the absence of fever and no signs of ongoing infection, antibiotics were not yet started. An atherosclerotic mechanism was primarily considered, but a vasculitic process was likewise considered due to elevated acute phase reactants.The initial plan was Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) but due to financial limitations, an exploratory laparotomy with infrarenal endoaneurysmorrhaphy was eventually performed. Intraoperative findings were a saccular infrarenal aneurysm with dissection up to the proximal right common iliac artery and an abscess compartment, with an aspirated volume of approximately 5 mL, within the false lumen in the anterior aortic wall. The entire infected aneurysmal segment was resected, and piperacillin-tazobactam was immediately started. Abscess culture yielded a high growth of Salmonella group B. Guided by the sensitivity pattern, the antibiotic was shifted to Ceftriaxone. This was continued after discharge as outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy to complete 6 weeks then a lifetime of chronic suppressive therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 160/800 mg OD. Syphilis and HIV screening were both negative. Micrographs of the aortic wall biopsy showed fibrin deposition necrosis and calcification with peripheral viable cellular infiltrates consisting of neutrophils and foamy macrophages consistent with an atherosclerotic process (see Figures 4–6). Given the histopathologic findings that favored aortitis rather than vasculitis, steroids were tapered down gradually. Aspirin was started postoperatively. Atorvastatin and antihypertensive medications were continued. She was discharged after 2 weeks and followed up regularly at the outpatient clinic.The etiology of SLE remains unknown but is likely multifactorial from genetic, immunologic, and environmental mechanisms. It occurs more commonly among women of reproductive age. The prevalence rate in the United States is around 20 to 150 per 100,000 women [3]. Among Asian countries, the prevalence rate falls within 30-50/100,000 people [4]. Aortic involvement has been found among many rheumatologic conditions and may present with a plethora of clinical manifestations [5]. Aortic diseases in SLE are not commonly reported. However, a case-control study found that SLE patients have a higher proportion of aortic aneurysms compared with age- and sex-matched controls, with an odds ratio of 4.5 [6].Several pathophysiologic hypotheses have been purported to explain the occurrence of aortic aneurysms in SLE. Popular theories include an autoimmune process, such as vasculitis with associated medial degeneration, or an atherosclerotic process due to longstanding steroid use, hypertension, and dyslipidemia [2, 7]. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) is a suppressor of vascular wall inflammation as well as inhibitor of smooth muscle proliferation; type I interferon is associated with impaired endothelial function. Downregulation of TGF-β1 and activation of interferons in SLE have been suggested as immunologic mechanisms contributing to arterial wall dysfunction [6]. A meta-analysis conducted by Kurata and colleagues in 2011 examined the pathophysiological relationship of certain clinical and histopathologic findings to the formation of aortic aneurysms in SLE. They included 35 cases reported over the past 40 years of SLE with aortic aneurysms, including those complicated by dissection. The study found that aortic involvement in SLE affected relatively younger individuals, with an average age of 44.5 years, and that the thoracic aorta was more commonly involved. This is contrary to aneurysms found in the general population which are usually discovered in the sixth decade of life and more commonly affecting the abdominal rather than the thoracic segments. Correlation analysis led the authors to outline two distinct pathways of aortic aneurysm formation in SLE. Thoracic aortic aneurysms were not linked with atherosclerosis but were positively correlated with vasculitis, cystic medial degeneration, dissection, and higher mortality rate. Abdominal aortic aneurysms on the other hand showed positive correlation with atherosclerosis associated with prolonged steroid treatment and with better prognosis [2].Aortitis, the pathologic term for inflammation of the aorta, is broadly subdivided into noninfectious and infectious aortitis. The majority of aortitis cases are noninfectious and include large-vessel vasculitides and other rheumatologic conditions. Infectious aortitis are less common [8]. A normal aorta is normally not prone to infection. However, damage to the aortic wall, such as in cases of atherosclerotic disease, aneurysm, cystic medial degeneration, endothelial damage from diabetes, medical devices, or surgery, makes it weak and vulnerable to infection. Microorganisms can seed hematogenously via the vasa vasorum, contiguously from the adjacent infected tissues, or by traumatic or iatrogenic means. Commonly implicated pathogens include Salmonella, Staphylococcal, and Streptococcus species. Tuberculous aortitis is infrequent in the developed countries [7, 8]. However, due to the high prevalence of tuberculous infections in our country, it is still relevant to include a tuberculous etiology in the differentials. According to a cross-sectional study in 2012, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella species are the most common pathogens (40%), with Salmonella as the most prevalent in abdominal aortitis, native aorta, and mycotic aneurysms [9]. Majority of adult cases inflicted with nontyphoid salmonellosis are group B (38%), then followed by group D (30%) and group C (23%) [10]. The known risk factors for invasive Salmonella infections are achlorhydria (i.e., intake of proton pump inhibitors) and immunosuppression (i.e., chronic steroids, immunocompromised host, and HIV infection). A minimum of three weeks post source control up to 6-12 weeks is recommended for endovascular infection. And chronic suppressive therapy is advised for patients with infected prosthetic materials, biliary tract abnormalities, and people living with HIV with nontyphoidal bacteremia, low CD4 counts, or those poorly responding to antiretroviral therapy. TMP-SMX 160/800 mg OD, levofloxacin 500 mg OD, or ciprofloxacin 500-750 mg OD can be given indefinitely [11].In our patient’s case, evidence of inflammation was demonstrated in the histopathologic sections of the excised aorta. The infiltrates were predominantly neutrophilic with foam cells thereby favoring an atherosclerotic over a vasculitic pathophysiology of the aneurysm. This is in contrast with the primarily lymphocytic inflammatory pattern of SLE vasculitis [12]. We can therefore surmise that our patient’s chronic SLE, coupled with the long-term steroid use, contributed to accelerated atherosclerosis and eventual aneurysm formation. This became a nidus for bacterial infiltration and proliferation, which in turn, may have further perpetuated aneurysmal growth and dissection. We hypothesize that the initial diarrhea of our patient may be due to inadequately treated Salmonella, with bacterial seeding on the abdominal aneurysm causing aortitis and the abscess formation. SLE patients have increased susceptibility to Salmonella presumably due to defective lymphocyte function, impaired effector cells (e.g., macrophage, monocytes, and granulocytes), and depletion of C3 opsonizing activity [13]. Our patient did not present with classic signs and symptoms of infection because she has been chronically maintained on multiple immunosuppressive agents to control SLE activity. The open repair allowed for gross inspection and discovery of the small pocket of abscess which was missed on the CT aortogram. It also allowed us to obtain biopsies and better understand the underlying disease process of aneurysm formation.Aortic complications are uncommon manifestations of SLE. These can be caused by vasculitis, atherosclerosis, infection, or a combination of these mechanisms. We highlight the significance of having a high index of suspicion for infectious causes of aortitis among immunocompromised patients presenting with aneurysm prior to pursuing an endovascular versus an open approach for repair. Inadvertently placing an endovascular graft in an infected aortic aneurysm would have led to graft infection and catastrophic morbidity.This case report has been presented in the following conferences: first place, oral presentation, Case Report Category, Philippine Heart Association 49th Annual Convention, May 2018; oral presentation, Case Report Category, Korean Society of Cardiology 62nd Annual Scientific Meeting, October 2018; oral presentation, Case Report Category, Philippine General Hospital Department of Medicine Research Forum, November 2018; poster presentation, Asian Pacific Society of Cardiology Congress, Taipei, Taiwan, May 2018; and poster presentation, 20th Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology Congress, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, September 2018.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Seizure: An Adverse Effect of Regadenoson in Myocardial Perfusion Imaging
Department of Internal Medicine, MedStar Washington Hospital Center, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Sohab S.

Since adenosine receptors are involved in synaptic transmission between neurons throughout the central nervous system (CNS) including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and other structures as well, regadenoson can lower the seizure threshold in susceptible individuals. Epileptogenic activity is an uncommon yet potentially severe adverse effect of regadenoson use, and therefore, more awareness is required in screening patients at risk and evaluating alternate ways to investigate coronary artery disease (CAD) in susceptible individuals.Regadenoson is a selective A2a receptor agonist that acts on coronary artery smooth muscle to promote vasodilatation, increasing myocardial blood flow. It is widely used in rest-pharmacological stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) as part of cardiac testing to evaluate for CAD, especially in patients with limited exercise capacity. It has largely replaced adenosine in MPI due to a better safety profile. However, adenosine receptors and their subtypes are present in several extracardiac tissues resulting in cross reactivity and potential toxicity. One example is that adenosine receptors play a role in neuroregulation and excitatory glutamatergic transmission; thus, regadenoson can lower seizure threshold through A2a receptor stimulation. We hereby present a case of seizure provoked by regadenoson administration and subsequently discuss the underlying mechanism.A 74-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, CAD status post coronary artery bypass grafting, and ischemic stroke with residual left-sided weakness presented to the emergency department with a one-day history of retrosternal chest pain radiating to her left shoulder. On presentation she was normotensive, and electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, left axis deviation, and T wave inversion in leads I and aVL which were unchanged from a prior EKG several months ago. Initial troponin I was negative. Based on her risk factor profile and pretest probability for CAD, she was scheduled for a rest-pharmacological stress MPI test. While at rest, the patient was injected intravenously with 99mTc-tetrofosmin and images were acquired approximately 45-60 minutes later with 180-degree single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Subsequently, the patient was injected with 0.4 mg of regadenoson over 15-20 seconds while being monitored by12-lead EKG. Approximately 30 seconds after regadenoson injection, the patient was injected with 99mTc-tetrofosmin and 180-degree SPECT images were taken approximately 45 minutes later. The gated SPECT images revealed normal rest and stress tetrofosmin perfusion, as well as a normal left ventricular function. Approximately 120 minutes after regadenoson administration, the patient developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that lasted for 3 minutes. On initial assessment, she was hemodynamically stable and not hypoxic. She received 2 mg of lorazepam and 1 g of levetiracetam intravenously, which aborted the seizure. She did not receive aminophylline. On physical examination after she regained consciousness, she was confused and not oriented. Cranial nerves were intact, and motor strength was unchanged from baseline (5/5 at the right upper and lower extremities and 4/5 at the left upper and lower extremities). Initial blood work revealed sodium of 142 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, glucose 5.82 mmol/L, calcium 2.17 mmol/L, and magnesium 0.78 mmol/L. Due to concern for a new cerebrovascular accident in setting of prior history and this acute event, she underwent an emergent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study which did not reveal any acute changes. She was started on levetiracetam 500 mg orally twice daily. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed and revealed no epileptiform abnormalities or epileptogenic foci. Of note, she was not taking any antidepressants such as bupropion or other medications that may lower seizure threshold. She was discharged home 4 days later, with a diagnosis of regadenoson-induced seizure.Regadenoson is a selective A2a receptor agonist, which is predominant in coronary artery smooth muscle. However, it is also a weak agonist at A1a receptors with negligible affinity to A2b and A3a receptors as well [1]. It is commonly used as a pharmacological stress test agent to assess coronary blood flow in patients with limited functional capacity who cannot undergo exercise stress testing. When compared to adenosine, regadenoson was associated with a greater and more rapid peak in heart rate and demonstrated noninferiority in detecting perfusion defects with a better safety profile [2, 3]. However, given the wide range of adenosine receptors and their subtypes, a diverse adverse effect profile of regadenoson has been reported including nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, and headache [4]. Other side effects such as atrioventricular block, bronchoconstriction, and flushing have been attributed to its agonistic effects on A1a, A2b, and A3a receptors, respectively, despite low affinity [1, 5].Seizure is one of the recently recognized adverse effects of regadenoson with increasing incidence. As of June 2018, a total of 148 cases of seizures and 10 cases of seizure-like phenomena were reported to the US Food and Drug Administration as adverse effects of regadenoson. Of note, the population size exposed to regadenoson, as well as the average time from injection to seizure onset, and past history of seizures or strokes in those patients have not been reported to the FDA [4]. A2a receptors are widely distributed in the CNS including the cerebral cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus [6]. Adenosine, specifically, through A2a receptors plays a role in glutamate outflow tracts and thus is involved in excitatory neurotransmission between neurons [7]. Several animal models, specifically rodents, have been studied regarding the role of A2a receptors in neuronal interaction, as well as the clinical application of adenosine receptor antagonists in treatment of seizures. One study investigated the consequences of deleting the A2a receptor in mice by comparing the incidence of electroshock-induced seizures in A2a-knockout mice versus controls [8]. Results showed that A2a-knockout mice demonstrated lower percentage as well as intensity of seizures than controls [8]. In another study, bilateral striata of rats were lesioned using the excitotoxin quinolinic acid, and this was followed by the administration of SCH 58261 (potent A2a receptor antagonist) [7]. Those who received SCH 58261 showed significantly lower motor, electroencephalographic, and neuropathologic changes secondary to excitotoxin [7]. Despite such findings, the clinical application of adenosine receptor antagonists in the treatment of epilepsy is still under investigation.Regarding the pharmacokinetics of regadenoson, the elimination half-life follows a 3-compartment model [9]. The half-life of the initial phase is approximately 1-4 minutes, followed by an intermediate phase which has a half-life up to 30 minutes [9]. The final and terminal phase has a half-life lasting up to 2 hours [9, 10]. Most adverse effects begin soon after regadenoson administration and resolve usually within 15 minutes; though of those reported, the majority involves bronchospasm and cardiac conduction blocks [11]. Moreover, a case series by Page et al. demonstrated 3 cases of regadenoson-induced seizures that developed within 2-5 minutes of administration [12]. Two cases had a prior medical history of seizures and were receiving antiepileptic drugs, while one had no prior seizure history which however displayed hemodynamic instability prior to seizure onset [12]. On the other hand, it has been reported that seizure onset following regadenoson administration may be delayed as well, but no specific time onset was defined [13, 14]. For such reasons, aminophylline, a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, has been used to prevent delayed adverse effects, especially in patients at higher risk, such as a prior history of seizures [14]. Although it potentially antagonizes adenosine receptors, aminophylline is not a good option for reversal of regadenoson-induced seizures, as it may be sometimes ineffective in such setting and may even lower seizure threshold further and thus provoke seizures [12].While the exact incidence of regadenoson-induced seizures is unknown, more cases are being reported as discussed above. We believe that the seizure in our patient may have been provoked by regadenoson, since other organic and structural causes were ruled out. The American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) recommends avoiding regadenoson in patients with a medical history of seizures and structural brain disease and lists it as a relative contraindication to this medication [15]. We believe that our case adds to the available literature describing this uncommon but potentially severe adverse effect of regadenoson. It also advocates for increased physician awareness in screening patients at risk and providing prompt detection and appropriate management. It is also imperative to remember that aminophylline should be used with caution in reversal of regadenoson-induced seizure as indicated above. Additionally, nuclear medicine physicians and technicians need to be aware of such adverse events, and appropriate acute seizure termination measures should be always easily accessible.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.This case report was written by SSR and OGS.

Cardiac and Systemic Thrombus Caused by Drug Abuse
Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas, 1001 N Minneapolis St., Wichita, KS 67214, USACorrespondence should be addressed to John Eliveha; moc.liamg@ahevilebjReceived 25 January 2019; Accepted 28 March 2019; Published 7 April 2019Academic Editor: Antonio de Padua MansurCopyright © 2019 John Eliveha et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Drug abuse is an increasing concern all over the world especially in the United States. Methamphetamine have been well established to cause elevated body temperature, irregular heartbeat, seizures, and heart disease. We present a case of ventricular thrombus with systemic emboli in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy after methamphetamine use.Methamphetamine is a sympathomimetic amine that increases synaptic concentration of serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine, creating hallucinogenic, euphoric, and stimulant effects [1]. Cardiovascular complications are the second leading cause of death in methamphetamine users [2]. The cardiac complications of methamphetamines are hypothesized from a variety of mechanisms such as hypertension, tachycardia, and myocardial toxicity with cellular death, fibrosis, and contraction band necrosis [3, 4].A 24-year-old female with a history of HIV/AIDS, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and methamphetamine and marijuana abuse presented with acute onset lower extremity pain. The patient reported to have snorted methamphetamine overnight and woke up with severe lower extremity pain as well as inability to move. Surgical history was significant for excision of sublingual glands. Family history: mother was HIV positive; both mother and father had significant history of substance abuse. She drank one to two alcoholic drinks per week and was an everyday smoker, between 1/4 pack and 1/2 pack per day. Her vital signs were significant for tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Lower extremity examination was positive for tender lower extremities with no palpable dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, and popliteal pulses bilaterally. Initial lab tests were significant for lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury, EKG with nonspecific ST-T wave changes (Figure 1), elevated troponin, 1.08 ng/ml, peaked at 3.5 ng/ml and urine drug screen was positive for methamphetamine and marijuana. Hemoglobin 11.9 gm/dl, white blood cells 10.4, platelets 178, sodium 139 mmol/liter, potassium 4.1 mmol/liter, chloride 104 mmol/liter, bicarbonate 20 mmol/liter, BUN 11 mg/dl, creatinine 1.3 mg/liter, blood glucose 141 mg/dl, AST 68 units/liter, ALT 41 units/liter, total bilirubin 0.9 grams/dl, alkaline phosphatase 107 IU/liter, and INR 1.8. Arterial and venous duplex of the lower extremities revealed no blood flow. CT angiogram showed large segment aortic occlusion (4 cm) just beyond the renal arteries and partial occlusive thrombus in the superior mesenteric artery with early ischemia (Figures 2 and 3). There were also multiple areas of bilateral renal infarcts left greater than right with the main renal arteries patent bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an echo dense mass, ,  in size, in the left ventricle with defined margins that are distinct from the endocardium seen throughout systole and diastole, consistent with left ventricular thrombus (Figures 4–6). Ejection fraction was estimated to be 15 %, with increased wall thickness and grade 3 diastolic dysfunction. There was mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with normal valve structure. CT head was obtained due to an altered mental status which was negative for acute bleeding. The patient became profoundly hypotensive which was likely due to cardiogenic shock despite being on maximum vasopressors. She developed limb ischemia due to compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. Interventional radiology and vascular surgery were consulted, surgical thrombectomy was done. The patient’s status worsened developing rhabdomyolysis, shock liver, and acute kidney injury with severe metabolic acidosis. She could not tolerate continuous renal replacement therapy. The patient had an episode of ventricular fibrillation and expired after three days of being hospitalized.Methamphetamine cause myocardial damage via multifactorial mechanisms. Excessive catecholamine activity is thought to be the primary mode underlying the cardiotoxic effects of methamphetamines, leading to excessive vasoconstriction, vasospasm, rapid heart rate, and high blood pressure [5]. Tachycardia leads to myocardial necrosis; increased blood pressure leads to fibrosis; vasospasm leads to hypertrophy of cells. Direct cardiac toxicity including hypertrophy and other damage in the heart has been well established, but the understanding of the pathophysiology is unknown [5].A major complication of acute myocardial infarction is left ventricular thrombus formation. Risk factors for thrombus formation include large infarct size (), severe apical akinesia or dyskinesis, formation of ventricular aneurysms, and anterior myocardial infarction [6]. Virchow’s triad is a prerequisite for in vivo thrombus formation. LV wall regional akinesia and dyskinesia result in stasis. Prolonged ischemia leads to subendocardial tissue injury with inflammatory changes. Acute MI patients have increased concentrations of prothrombin, fibrinopeptide A, and von Willebrand factor and decreased concentrations of ADAMTS 13 [7]. Left ventricular thrombus can occur within 24 hours of MI [8]. Patients can present with left ventricular thrombus after unrecognized myocardial infarction. Conditions that increase the risk for systemic embolization include severe congestive heart failure, diffuse left ventricular dilation, systolic dysfunction, previous embolization, advanced age, and the presence of left ventricular protruding or mobile thrombus [7].Our patient had a prolonged history of methamphetamine abuse. She had chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, 10-15% with severe dilated cardiomyopathy and diffuse hypokinesis. We hypothesized that catecholamine storm due to acute methamphetamine intoxication caused acute myocardial infarction. This was unrecognized mainly because of atypical presentation. Severe dyskinesia along with diffuse wall motion abnormalities led to stasis of blood and eventual thrombus formation. The patient had significant risk factors for systemic embolization including severe congestive heart failure and systolic dysfunction, leading to systemic embolization.A high index of suspicion is paramount to making a diagnosis. Presence of risk factors, especially presence of severely reduced ejection fraction without anticoagulation, should prompt physicians to look out for left ventricular thrombus. Diagnosis can be made using two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram which is cheap, is readily available, and has excellent specificity, 85-90%, and sensitivity of 95% in detecting left ventricular thrombus [9]. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with contrast delayed enhancement (DE) has significantly better accuracy than TTE for the diagnosis of LV thrombus, 99% specificity, and 88% sensitivity [9, 10]. DE-CMR is nowadays considered the gold standard for diagnosis. Vitamin K antagonist is the standard of treatment. The European guidelines recommend antivitamin K treatment for 3-6 months while the American guidelines recommend indefinite treatment for patients with low risk of bleeding [7].Physicians should be aware of the cardiac complications of methamphetamine. Left ventricular thrombus with systemic emboli is a potential complication of chronic methamphetamine use.Usually, patients with decreased ejection fraction are at a higher risk.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Ventricular Arrhythmia Precipitated by Severe Hypocalcaemia Secondary to Primary Hypoparathyroidism
Papworth Hospital, Papworth Everard, Cambridge, UKCorrespondence should be addressed to S. Ashwin Reddy; ten.batnac@ydder.niwhsaReceived 8 January 2019; Accepted 5 March 2019; Published 7 April 2019Academic Editor: Kathleen NguCopyright © 2019 S. Ashwin Reddy. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Hypocalcaemia causes neuromuscular and myocardial symptoms, including QT interval prolongation, and cardiac arrhythmias. Prompt detection and calcium replacement may reverse the pathology, following which the underlying cause should be diagnosed and treated to prevent recurrence. I present the case of a young man presenting with collapse who was found to have sinus rhythm with significant QT interval prolongation on admission electrocardiogram (ECG) associated with profound hypocalcaemia secondary to primary hypoparathyroidism.The evaluation of blackout in the emergency setting can be challenging due to the myriad potential diagnoses ranging from the benign (such as vasovagal or postural syncope) to the potentially fatal (such as seizure or ventricular tachyarrhythmia). Ventricular arrhythmias may be precipitated by disordered ventricular repolarisation, manifested on the 12-lead electrocardiogram as prolongation of the QT interval beyond 450 ms in males and 470 ms in females when corrected for heart rate. A common but often overlooked cause of QT prolongation are electrolyte disorders, and prompt identification and treatment of these can lead to normalisation of the QT interval.Primary hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition with a prevalence of 17-22 per 100,000 [1, 2]. Serum hypocalcaemia resulting from this condition can predispose to QT prolongation and present with potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias [3, 4].A previously healthy 20-year-old Caucasian man was presented to the emergency department following two episodes of loss of consciousness occurring at rest over a fortnight. A witness described collapse followed by shaking of all four limbs but no other epileptiform activity. Spontaneous recovery occurred after a few minutes. The patient denied alcohol or drug use and had an otherwise unremarkable medical history. He had no family history of blackout, collapse, or unexplained sudden death. Physical examination was entirely normal, with specifically no evidence of cardiac failure, no audible murmurs, no tetany, and no facial dysmorphia. He was haemodynamically stable. An initial diagnosis of “seizure” was made in the emergency department pending for further investigations.His ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm with a prolonged corrected QT interval of 588 ms (normal <450) (Figure 1). The PR interval and QRS duration were within normal limits. Admission bloods revealed a corrected calcium of <1.25 mmol/L (normal range 2.2-2.5), phosphate 2.88 mmol/L (0.8-1.4), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 172 μ/L (35-135). The rest of his bloods, including magnesium, potassium, and renal function, was normal. Endocrine investigations showed a parathyroid hormone (PTH) of <3 ng/mL (14-72), vitamin D 24.1 nmol/L (25-50), and normal thyroid function tests. Echocardiography showed no structural abnormality and preserved ventricular size and function. Computerised tomography (CT) head was also unremarkable.The patient was admitted to a monitored bed and commenced on intravenous calcium replacement (10 mls 10% calcium gluconate bolus over 30 minutes, followed by infusion of 1% calcium gluconate in one litre of normal saline at a rate of 50 mls/hour). Whilst on the cardiac monitor he was observed to have short episodes of nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) which spontaneously resolved; some of these were associated with dizziness but no loss of consciousness. As his serum calcium rose, his ECG normalised and he had no further presyncopal episodes. Once the serum calcium and QTc were within normal limits, he was discharged on oral calcium and vitamin D supplement (Calcichew D3 one tablet twice daily) and 1-alpha-calcidol 1 mcg once daily with early follow-up.Screening of the patient’s mother and younger brother revealed that they too had low levels of PTH and hypocalcaemia but to a less severe degree. His mother’s ECG demonstrated a QTc at the upper limit of normal whilst his brother’s was within normal limits. The patient was estranged from his father. The family underwent extensive genotyping to identify an underlying cause for their hypoparathyroidism but as yet no clear genetic variant has been identified.At initial follow-up, the patient’s serum calcium and ECG parameters have remained within the normal range, and he has suffered no further syncopal episodes.Hypocalcaemia predisposes to arrhythmias by affecting both depolarisation and repolarisation of cardiac myocytes. Normally, calcium blocks sodium channels and prevents depolarisation. Decreases in calcium allow increased sodium passage and lowers the depolarisation threshold, causing greater myocardial irritability [5].Furthermore, hypocalcaemia causes the opening of L-type calcium channels during the repolarisation phase of the cardiac action potential [6], prolonging the QT interval. Late calcium influx and early after-depolarisation then occurs. If the depolarisation threshold is reached, a new action potential can be triggered. As neighbouring myocytes may be at different stages of refractoriness, this may lead to reentrant tachyarrhythmias (namely, torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation), thus causing loss of cardiac output and collapse or sudden death. Both the myocardial irritability and QTc prolongation can be reversed by correcting serum calcium.Aside from QTc prolongation, severe hypocalcaemia may also present with atrioventricular (AV) block, paresthaesia, abdominal cramps, fatigue, altered mood, and tetany. Tetany can sometimes manifest clinically as Chvostek’s sign (facial twitching on tapping over the facial nerve just anterior to the ipsilateral ear) or Trousseau’s sign (carpal spasm induced by obstructing the brachial artery for 3 minutes with an inflated blood pressure cuff). Seizures and bronchospasm are more severe presentations and constitute an emergency [7, 8].PTH acts to raise serum calcium by promoting calcium resorption from bone, reducing renal tubular calcium excretion and stimulating the synthesis of 1.25(OH)2 vitamin D in the kidney, thus increasing calcium absorption from the small intestine. Hypoparathyroidism thus causes hypocalcaemia [9]. Our patient had undetectably low levels of PTH which, given the serological abnormalities also present in his first degree relatives, is likely due to a presumed though hitherto unidentified genetic condition. PTH replacement therapy is in nascent stages of development: currently, the mainstay of treatment remains oral calcium and vitamin D replacement.The QTc interval can be abnormally prolonged due to other factors, both acquired and inherited. Acquired causes include drugs (most commonly macrolide and quinolone antibiotics, tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, amiodarone, and sotalol), other electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia), and hypothyroidism. Removal or treatment of the underlying cause will often lead to correction of the QTc interval, often back to normal as in this case.Inherited long QT syndrome can arise due to a mutation in a gene-encoding ion channels intrinsic to the cardiac action potential and is often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The identification of a specific genetic mutation in an index individual allows for cascade screening of relatives, enabling institution of therapy at a presymptomatic stage where appropriate. The mainstay of therapy in inherited long QT syndrome is beta blockade, with second line therapies including flecainide and surgical sympathectomy. In individuals at higher risk of sudden cardiac death, implantation of a transvenous or subcutaneous cardiac defibrillator is indicated. In those untreated who experience syncope or aborted sudden death, the mortality rate at 15 years is around 50%, but this decreases drastically with careful treatment to approximately 1%.Prolongation of the QTc interval on the 12-lead ECG can be a subtle finding and can be easily missed. This is further complicated by the fact that approximately 2.5% of the normal population will have a prolonged QTc interval. Thus, in young patients presenting with a syncopal episode, particularly in the presence of myoclonic jerking, this can often lead to misdiagnosis of seizures if inadequate care is taken over initial clinical assessment. This not only delays diagnosis and appropriate treatment but also can sometimes lead to the administration of anticonvulsant therapy which has the potential to cause further harm. In this instance, the initial differential diagnosis of seizures was quickly downgraded once the ECG had been performed, and no anticonvulsant treatment was given.This case reiterates the importance of considering cardiac arrhythmias as a cause of unexplained syncope with myoclonus and to have a low index of suspicion for considering specifically long QT-associated ventricular tachyarrhythmia. It also strongly demonstrates the importance of accounting for metabolic causes of cardiac rhythm disturbances as these are potentially easily treatable and reversible.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
The Insidious Cardiac Tumor: A Primary Left Atrium Intimal Cardiac Sarcoma in a Young Patient
Department of Medicine, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Health, Newark, NJ, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Chika-Nwosuh Ogechukwu; moc.liamg@husownakihcoReceived 13 November 2018; Revised 6 February 2019; Accepted 4 March 2019; Published 4 April 2019Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2019 Chika-Nwosuh Ogechukwu et al.

A 36-year-old presented with syncope, dyspnea, Computed Tomography Pulmonary angiography study obtained was negative for pulmonary emboli but revealed a left atrial mass. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed a mass with multiple lobes and a broad base attached to the septum, encroaching into the right atrium, aortic root wall, base of the anterior mitral leaflet flowing to the mitral orifice in diastole also obstructing the right pulmonary vein. Despite a quick diagnosis and plan to begin treatment, the patient rapidly declined owing to the extent and aggressive nature of this cardiac malignancy. This case reports the insidious nature of these tumors as well as how challenging and life threatening they are at the time of their clinical manifestation.Primary cardiac sarcomas are rare clinical entities and pose challenges in their management, given their aggressive nature and high recurrence rate [1]. Over 75% of primary cardiac tumors are benign, the remaining 25% are malignant [1]. Of the 25% of malignant cardiac tumors, 75% are sarcomas [2]. Up until 2006, fewer than 20 cases had been reported about cardiac sarcomas [1]. Intimal sarcoma also tends to present in the right atrium, albeit rare, they can be seen in the left atrium [3]. The diagnosis relies mainly on image modalities such as echocardiography, computed tomography, coronary angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Without tissue sampling, they could easily be mistaken for myxoma or a clot which could delay management [4]. Immediate diagnosis is essential to avoid cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, ischemia due to obstruction of coronary arteries, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, metastasis, or delay in management [5]. Treatment involves resection, chemotherapy, and radiation, with the median survival of six months [6]. Surgical resection remains the most common treatment for most cardiac tumors and involves the complex cardiac reconstruction especially in malignant cases [4].A 36-year-old male with no past medical history presented to the hospital with two syncopal episodes, worsening palpitations, and progressive dyspnea on exertion (NYHA class II-III). He reported no prodromal symptoms, immediately regained consciousness after a few seconds without any postictal signs. First syncopal episode occurred 2 weeks earlier while in a passenger seat; he sought no medical attention at the time. The second episode was during a coughing fit the evening of his presentation. Both episodes were said to be witnessed without any seizure activity. Six months prior to the onset of the syncopal episodes, he began experiencing dyspnea with mild exertion which progressed, limiting his functional activities. He reported a 40 lbs weight loss over six months which he had attributed to his intent to lose weight (BMI 38). He also admitted to night sweats but denied chest discomfort, increased abdominal girth, or leg swelling.Physical examination revealed BP 123/78 mmHg, HR 120-150 sbpm which was irregularly irregular, RR 26 breaths per minute, hypoxic at 88% on room air with improvement in Bipap, and laying in Trendelenburg position, negative orthostatic. There was a presence of bibasilar crackles in the lung field, no jugular venous distention or peripheral edema noted, cardiovascular examination was limited due to body habitus and rapid irregular heart rate, and the rest of the exam was unremarkable except for morbid obesity. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed supraventricular tachycardia and subsequently atrial fibrillation (Figure 1); there was no old EKG to compare. He was started on Cardizem drip at 5 mg/hour and titrated up to maintain a goal heart rate of 80-110 bpm. Chest radiography remarkable for bilateral pleural effusion is worse on the left than the right.A Computed Tomography Pulmonary angiography study was negative for pulmonary emboli but revealed a left atrial mass (Figure 2). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an 8-9 cm atrial mass attached to the interatrial septum (Video 1). Given significant outflow obstruction, the patient was taken to the operating room (OR) for possible resection. Transesophageal echocardiogram (Figure 3) in the OR demonstrated similar mass with multiple lobes and a broad base attached to the septum, encroaching into the right atrium, aortic root wall, base of the anterior mitral leaflet flowing to the mitral orifice in diastole also obstructing the right pulmonary vein seen in. A biopsy and partial resection were performed with no much change in size; the patient was not a candidate for complete resection due to the extensive cardiac involvement.Pathology (Figure 4) revealed intimal sarcoma evidenced by markers positive for MDM2, CDK4 gene, and KIT and PDGFRA amplification. The patient was rate and rhythm controlled with Cardizem and digoxin. An oncologist was consulted with a plan of treatment with doxorubicin and olaratumab. However, the patient against medical advice wanted to delay treatment for few days. He unfortunately expired from pulseless electrical activity arrest during the same hospital admission after 3 weeks of hospitalization.Cardiac sarcomas are quite rare, with the male predisposition being 2.5 : 1 [3], and usually occurs in the 3rd and 4th decade of life [3]. It typically occurs in the right atrium and rarely in the left [1]. They often infiltrate into the septum and other structures of the heart resulting in significant outflow obstruction, thus, are very aggressive [3].In majority of cases, cardiac tumors can be silent; however, when symptoms occur, they are determined based mainly on the size and anatomical location of the tumor [4]. They classically present with signs of congestive heart failure depending on the obstructing atrium. Right heart outflow obstruction can present with jugular venous distention, lower extremities swelling, and ascites mimicking symptoms of right sided heart failure. Involvement of the left side of the heart typically presents with dyspnea due to pulmonary congestion, syncope, and cardiogenic shock from lack of forward flow. Most times, these sarcomas can be confused with benign conditions such as myxoma which are more common tumors of the left atrium [6].Image studies such as TTE and transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, coronary angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging are used for diagnosis and guiding surgical intervention [4]; however, specific diagnosis is made by tissue biopsy and histopathology.Surgical resection is possible in about 33% of these cases; however, they have a tendency to recur, while others are deemed nonresectable [3]. The standard of treatment involves resection with chemotherapy and radiation. A study by Bakaeen et al. showed a median survival of 24 months in 27 patients after surgical resection and also better outcome with multimodality treatment [6]. In recent studies, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical resection has been deemed safe and effective in primary sarcoma on the right heart [7]. This mode of treatment enhances resection and can be translated to improvement in survival [7]. Our patient rapidly deteriorated given a significant poor prognosis due to the extent of the mass coupled with his delayed presentation in seeking medical attention. The delay in medical attention, initiation of chemotherapy, the aggressive nature, and the nonresectable mass all compounded to his rapid decline. Early surgical resection with chemotherapy and or radiotherapy may help improve survival in these patients.Given the rarity of these cardiac malignancy, very little studies have been conducted regarding the management of these rare tumors especially in nonsurgical candidates; hence, this calls for a meta-analysis on the outcome of surgical candidates and nonsurgical candidates who are treated with chemotherapy and or radiotherapy. This case also calls to question the differences between the left and right atria sarcoma in terms of their presentation, management, and prognosis.The authors have declared that there is no conflict of interest to disclose with regard to this paper.All authors contributed significantly to this manuscript.Video 1: transthoracic echocardiogram video showing the mass attached to the mitral valve obstructing inflow into the left ventricle.

STEMI after Dobutamine Stress Echocardiography in Hyperthyroid State

We report a case of a 39-year-old male who has been recently diagnosed with severe hyperthyroidism. He was undergoing dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) for evaluation of symptoms suggestive of stable angina. The exam was complicated by ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction- (STEMI-) required coronary angiography that showed mild coronary artery disease.It is known that hyperthyroidism alters the hemodynamics of the cardiovascular system through increasing the oxygen demand [1]. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is an effective and safe test to detect coronary artery disease (CAD) with low risk of adverse events [2–4]. STEMI was reported in patients undergoing DSE in about 0.1% of cases; most of them had underlying significant coronary arteries [5, 6]. We detail a case of a 39-year-old male who recently had severe hyperthyroidism. He developed chest pain, significant ST elevation, and raised cardiac enzymes following DSE for angina-type chest pain. Coronary angiography showed CAD with mild luminal stenosis.A 39-year-old Asian male, with a recent diagnosis of severe hyperthyroidism and family history of coronary artery disease but no other cardiovascular risk factors, presented with intermittent angina-type chest pain of 8-month duration. He also reported heat intolerance, recurrent palpitation, sweating, watery diarrhea, and weight loss of 10 kg over a 3-month duration. Methimazole and propranolol were initiated two days before the actual presentation. On examination, he had normal heart sounds, no gallop, murmur, or rub tachycardia but with regular and synchronous heart rate, and no clinical signs of heart failure. Neck exam revealed diffuse mild thyroid enlargement and general exam showed fine hand tremors. Electrocardiography on presentation showed biphasic T waves in V1 and V2 (Figure 1). Three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative; TSH was <0.005 mIU/L (0.45-4.5) and T4 was 48.3 pmol/L (9-20) reference and units. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal with good left ventricular function (ejection fraction (EF): 70%) and no regional wall motion abnormalities. As the patient did not tolerate exercise treadmill stress test, he underwent a dobutamine stress echo. Dobutamine was infused at 3-minute intervals, starting with 10 μg/kg and increasing to 20 μg/kg, 30 μg/kg, and 40 μg/kg in addition to 0.5 mg atropine IV until a target heart rate of 153 bpm accounting for 95% of his maximal predicted heart rate. The patient developed severe chest pain and systemic hypotension with a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg. ST elevation in the anterolateral leads, new RBBB, and short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) on continuous ECG monitoring were noted (Figure 2).Echocardiography showed new regional wall motion abnormalities in the form of akinesia of the apical, mid anteroseptal, and mid anterior walls and hypokinesia of the mid anterolateral and mid posterolateral walls with a drop of EF to 30%. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, and resuscitation with IV fluids led to improvement in his blood pressure and propranolol was uptitrated till heart rate became controlled. Chest pain and ST elevation normalized spontaneously resolved. Cardiac troponin T reached a peak of 1900 ng/L but serial troponins showed progressive improvement. Global longitudinal strain measures (Figure 3) were abnormal in the left anterior descending (LAD) territory (Figure 4). Dual antiplatelets, heparin infusion along with propranolol and statin, started and kept on IV hydrocortisone 100 mg three times daily for 3 days to decrease the possibility of thyroid storm with coronary angiography (CAG). CAG was done 3 days later and showed 40% LAD stenosis proximal to D1 with no evidence of thrombus, myocardial bridging, or coronary vasospasm. Left circumflex artery (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA) were normal. No provocation test was done and the patient was discharged home in a stable condition on full medications.The patient showed dramatic improvement of symptoms over the next few days with improvement of the hyperthyroid state and was discharged successfully with minimal symptoms.Cardiovascular symptoms are the most prominent in patients with hyperthyroidism. The features of angina-type chest pain may be present in about 20% of these patients [7]. The possible mechanism includes underlying atheroma, metabolic effect of thyroxin on the myocardium, secondary arrhythmias [7], and transient coronary artery spasm [8, 9]. Similarly, coronary artery vasospasm with DSE has been reported in about 0.14%-0.4% [5, 10]. Studies [11] have shown that stress echocardiography in hyperthyroidism might lead to the hyperdynamic cardiac state, including worse exercise capacity and impaired vasodilatory and contractile reserves. However, the association between hyperthyroidism and myocardial infarction during DSE has never been reported.In our patient, there was no history suggestive of coronary vasospasm, and coronary angiogram did not show any significant coronary artery disease. The possible mechanism in our case could be an exaggerated response to dobutamine, in the presence of severe hyperthyroidism and moderate coronary artery lesion.Similarly, studies [10, 12, 13] have shown STEMI due to oxygen supply-demand mismatch, vasospasm, coronary artery dissection, or coronary artery plaque rupture with subsequent thrombus formation.Β-blockade may leave α-adrenergic vasoconstriction unopposed. Whether administration of propranolol enhances coronary spasm is not well established. Alvarez et al. [14] reported coronary vasospasm after administration of propranolol; however, other studies did not support this theory [15]. Other studies found no advantage of propranolol over diltiazem in preventing coronary spasms [16]. Keeping in mind those previous studies done on euthyroid patients, it may be not applicable to our patient which showed dramatic improvement of symptoms after increasing the propranolol doses.In our case, we did not see any coronary artery dissection or plaque rupture. It is difficult to rule out a plaque rupture with superimposed thrombus formation, but the transient nature of ST elevation will go against this possibility. Similarly, the coronary angiogram procedure was delayed in order to control his hyperthyroid state firstly, and therefore, the thrombus if present might have been resolved during this time.We believe our patient had transient ST-elevation myocardial infarction, secondary to DSE in a poorly controlled hyperthyroid state and moderated coronary artery disease. We would suggest treating hyperthyroidism prior to requesting noninvasive stress test and avoiding invasive coronary angiogram due to thyroid storm risk, based on the clinical picture. Our case also suggests that propranolol may be beneficial in controlling cardiac symptoms and possibly vasospasms in patients with hyperthyroidism.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
A Case of a 50-Year-Old Woman with Typical Fabry Disease Who Showed Serial Electrocardiographic and Echocardiographic Changes over a 17-Year Period
Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Vincent’s Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of KoreaCorrespondence should be addressed to Gee-Hee Kim; rk.ca.cilohtac@mikeehijReceived 1 December 2018; Revised 18 February 2019; Accepted 7 March 2019; Published 1 April 2019Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2019 Su Nam Lee et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Fabry disease (FD) is a progressive, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase A activity. Affected individuals accumulate globotriaosylceramide and glycosphingolipids in the lysosomes and cytoplasm of cells throughout the body, leading to major organ failure and premature death. Cardiac involvement includes left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmia, endothelial dysfunction at vascular wall, and cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis of FD can be difficult and there is often a long lag time between symptoms and diagnosis. Here, we present a case of a 50-year-old woman with typical Fabry disease who showed serial electrocardiographic and echocardiographic changes over 17 years prior to diagnosis with Fabry disease.Fabry disease (FD) is a progressive inherited metabolic disorder. Deficient activity of lysosomal α-galactosidase A (α-GLA) results in progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and related glycosphingolipids within lysosomes and, ultimately, leads to multiorgan dysfunction of the cardiac, renal, and cerebrovascular systems [1, 2]. Life- threatening cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications limit life expectancy [3]. Therefore, early diagnosis of FD before cardiocerebrovascular irreversible organ damage occurs is important. However, the diagnosis of FD is difficult and is made at approximately 13.7 and 16.3 years in males and females, respectively, after the onset of symptoms [4]. Cardiac involvement includes left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), arrhythmia, angina, and dyspnea. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in patients with FD are frequent and include LVH, ST segment depression, T wave inversion, short PR interval, prolonged QTc intervals, intermittent supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular (AV) node blocks, and bundle branch blocks [5, 6].Here, we report a case of a 50-year-old woman who showed serial electrocardiographic and echocardiographic changes over 17 years prior to diagnosis with typical FD.In 2000, a 34-year-old woman without disease was referred due to epigastric discomfort. A physical examination revealed no abnormal findings. Endoscopic examination showed normal findings. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed regular sinus rhythm with a normal PR interval (160 ms) and no LVH by the Sokolow-Lyon index (28 mm) (Figure 1(a)). The Sokolow-Lyon index for LVH defined as  in V1+R in V5 or V6 (whichever is larger) ≥ 35 mm [7].The patient was repeatedly admitted to our hospital from 2003 to 2010 (Table 1).In 2014, the patient was referred to our hospital with dyspnea and chest pain. An ECG showed a shorter PR interval (100 ms) and more severe LVH (50 mm) by the Sokolow-Lyon index than the previous examinations (Figure 1(f)). Laboratory testing revealed a normal creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level (132 U/L; normal range 60-190 U/L), an elevated creatine kinase- (CK-) MB isoenzyme level of 15.44 ng/mL (normal range 0.1-6.7 ng/mL), and a slightly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 302 U/L (normal range 140-271 U/L). TTE revealed LVH and partially decreased LV global longitudinal strain rates (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)).In 2016, the patient was again hospitalized with chest discomfort. The blood pressure was normal. An ECG showed a short PR interval (100 ms) and severe LVH (63 mm) by the Sokolow-Lyon index (Figure 1(g)). Laboratory testing revealed elevated CK-MB (15.21 ng/mL; normal range 0.1-6.7 ng/mL), LDH (494 U/L; normal range 140-271 U/L), and brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) levels (2223 pg/mL; normal  pg/mL) with a normal CPK level of 151 U/L (normal range 60-190 U/L). Creatinine was normal and the 24-hour creatinine clearance ratio (Ccr) was 101.1 mL/min/1.73m2. TTE showed a thicker LV wall than the previous results. In addition, TTE revealed marked decreased LV longitudinal strain rates (Figures 2(e) and 2(f)). Magnetic resonance imaging findings showed a delayed enhancement at the basal segment of LV lateral wall and LVH, and thus, FD was suspected (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Ophthalmic examination showed cornea verticillata (Figure 4). We measured α-GLA in patient’s blood plasma using a fluorometric enzyme assay. Leukocyte α-GLA was significantly reduced to 10.6 nmol/h/mg protein (normal  nmol/h/mg protein). We identified one hemizygous mutation in exon 6 of GLA, c.969delC (p.Leu324 Trpfs24). Therefore, this patient was diagnosed with classic FD.In 2017, the patient was admitted to cardiology for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Before ERT, an ECG still showed a short PR interval (100 ms) and extreme LVH (67 mm) by the Sokolow-Lyon index (Figure 1(h)). Laboratory testing revealed elevated CK-MB/CPK (38.91 ng/mL; normal range 0.1-6.7 ng/mL/272 U/L; normal range 60-190 U/L), LDH (289 U/L; normal range 140-271 U/L), and pro-BNP level (2853 pg/mL; normal  pg/mL). Eight months after ERT, ECG still showed a short PR interval and extreme LVH. TTE still showed LVH but a marked improvement of LV longitudinal strain rates (Figures 2(g) and 2(h)). The patient’s family members also underwent genetic testing, and the patient’s two sons were diagnosed with classic FD (Figure 5). We summarized the organ involvement and changes of Gb3 and lysoGb3 biomarkers of the affected family member in Tables 2 and 3.FD was identified in 1898 by Anderson and Fabry [8]. This inborn error of metabolism is characterized by either an absence or deficiency of α-GLA activity. The enzyme substrate, Gb-3, accumulates in a variety of cell types, including capillary endothelial, renal, cardiac, and nerve cells. The first clinical symptoms occur during childhood or adolescence and include a burning pain originating in the extremities, fever of unknown origin, hypohidrosis, and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal cramps and diarrhea [9]. More specific manifestations, such as angiokeratoma and asymptomatic corneal opacities, usually present in late adolescence. Neurological, cardiac, and renal complications develop in the third or fourth decade [2].Early signs of cardiac involvement may be present during adolescence. These signs include a shortened PR interval, arrhythmias, impaired heart rate variability, and mild valvular insufficiency [10]. Cardiac symptoms including LVH, arrhythmia, angina, and dyspnea are reported in approximately 40-60% of patients with FD [5, 6]. With an ECG, these early-stage patients had shorter PQ intervals due to a shortening of the P-wave duration as compared to age- and heart rate-matched healthy controls [11, 12]. LVH most commonly manifests at an average age of 32 years in men and 40 years in women [13].Progressive myocardial fibrosis develops with both interstitial and replacement fibrosis as the patient ages [14]. In end-stage patients, transmural replacement fibrosis gradually reduces cardiac function to the stage of congestive heart failure [13, 15]. Therefore, early diagnosis of FD is important, although the diagnosis of FD is difficult and there is often a long lag time between symptoms and diagnosis. Males are diagnosed at a median age of 24 years old and females at a median age of 31 years old. Diagnoses are made after 15 years for males and 18 years for females after the onset of symptoms [16].In this case, changes in ECG had been observed in the patient’s late 30s, specifically a shortened PR interval and severe LVH. We should have tested for FD in this patient with unexplained LVH. However, we did not consider FD at that time. Unlike in females, ECG changes in males occur in the early 30s because the activity of enzyme is lower than that in female. Gender differences are one of the reasons why it is difficult to diagnose FD. In female patients, the progression toward hypertrophy is prolonged, whereas the development of fibrosis and regional functional abnormalities progresses simultaneously. However, in males, LVH and concomitant reduction in longitudinal function appear in adolescence and both two processes lead to replacement fibrosis [17, 18].This case has not been reported previously, showing a series of long-term electrocardiographic changes prior to FD diagnosis. We reported here that serial ECG and TTE changes over 17 years were observed before the patient was diagnosed with FD. Physicians should be aware of the importance of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic changes, especially PR interval and LVH, in the diagnosis of FD.This case was presented at the poster session of the Lysosomal Disease Symposium 2018 (14th Annual WORLD Symposium) held in San Diego, United States, February 2018.The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.We acknowledge the helpful support of all authors.
Pseudomyocardial Infarction in a Patient with Severe Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Mild Hyperkalemia
1Internal Medicine Department, Hospital Universitario, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico2Echocardiography Laboratory, Cardiology Service, Hospital Universitario, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, Monterrey, Nuevo León, MexicoCorrespondence should be addressed to Edgar Francisco Carrizales-Sepúlveda; moc.liamtoh@98_irrac.ragdeReceived 11 December 2018; Accepted 7 March 2019; Published 31 March 2019Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2019 Edgar Francisco Carrizales-Sepúlveda et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 48-year-old male with a prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with malaise and nausea. On work-up, he was found with hyperglycemia and high anion gap metabolic acidosis, with a blood . A diagnosis of severe diabetic ketoacidosis was established; serum electrolyte analysis showed mild hyperkalemia. On work-up, a 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained, and it showed an ST-segment elevation on anterior leads that completely resolved with diabetic ketoacidosis treatment. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction can be a precipitant factor for diabetic ketoacidosis, and evaluation of diabetic patients with suspected myocardial infarction can be challenging since they can present with atypical or little symptoms. Hyperkalemia, which usually accompanies diabetic ketoacidosis, can cause electrocardiographic alterations that are well described, but ST-segment elevation is uncommon. A pseudomyocardial infarction pattern has been described in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis; of note, most of these patients presented severe hyperkalemia. We believe this is of great importance for clinicians because they must be able to recognize those patients that present with electrocardiographic abnormalities secondary to the metabolic alterations and those that can be experiencing actual ongoing ischemia, in order to establish an appropriate and prompt treatment.Heart tissue is particularly prone to the effects of systemic acidosis and hyperkalemia [1, 2]. Acidosis decreases myocardial contractibility by affecting the excitation-contraction coupling [1], and hyperkalemia causes depolarization of the cardiac-cell resting membrane potential, shortening of the action potential duration, and alterations in the conduction velocity [2]. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is considered one of the most serious acute complications of diabetes mellitus; it is characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and increased total body ketone concentrations [3]. Despite volume depletion seen in DKA secondary to vomiting and reduced oral intake, serum potassium levels are typically high at presentation; this is because lack of insulin and the presence of acidosis cause a shift of potassium from the intracellular space to extracellular space which usually resolve with DKA treatment [3, 4]. Thus, as a consequence of the acid-base and potassium derangements, patients with DKA can present electrocardiographic alterations than can be transient and resolve with treatment.A 48-year-old male presented to the emergency department with complaints of malaise and nausea. The past medical record was relevant for type 2 diabetes mellitus that was treated at the time with neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin. On initial examination, he had signs of severe dehydration and was polypneic; blood pressure was 80/60 mmHg, and heart rate was 125 bpm, with an oxygen saturation of 95% at room air. The capillary glucose level was 620 mg/dL; venous blood gases showed a metabolic acidosis with  and HCO3- of 4.1 mEq/L. A severe DKA was diagnosed, and treatment was started with aggressive hydration and IV insulin. Initial electrolytes were Na+ 119.6 mEq/L, Cl- 95 mEq/L, and K+ 5.7 mEq/L, and serum creatinine was 2.6 mg/dL; the anion gap was high, with 21 mmol/L. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and showed an ST-segment elevation of 4 millimeters in V1 and V2 leads and 1 millimeter elevation in aVR lead; also, there was a QRS complex widening and tall T-waves in V3-V5 (Figure 1). Concerns were raised of possible myocardial infarction as the precipitant factor for the DKA. A cardiology consult was required, and a point-of-care cardiac ultrasound was performed, which showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no regional wall motion abnormalities, cardiac troponins where ordered and reported within the normal range. The patient continued on management. After 1 hour and 30 minutes of treatment for DKA, a subsequent ECG was performed, and it showed a complete resolution of the ST-segment elevation (Figure 2). DKA was resolved, and the patient was admitted for monitoring, with a favorable evolution.Myocardial infarction is a known precipitant factor for DKA; it is responsible of about 1% of the cases, and along with congestive heart failure, it accounts for 28% of deaths in DKA [5]. According to clinical guideliness for diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation is considered suggestive of acute coronary obstruction if present in at least two contiguous leads (≥2.5 mm in  years, ≥2 mm in years, or ≥1.5 mm in women in leads V2-V3) and/or ≥1 mm in any other lead [6]. In the proper clinical context, patients with ST-segment elevation are candidates for reperfusion therapy, which must be instituted promptly since delay in treatment is associated with worst prognosis [6]. Evaluation of suspected myocardial infarction can be particularly challenging in diabetic patients, since they are more likely to present with atypical or little symptomatology [7].Electrocardiographic alterations related to hyperkalemia are well described [8]. Their presence and presentation depend on the potassium level and also on the rate of raise, acid-base status, other electrolyte disturbances, and medications [8, 9]. Tall, tent-shaped T-waves are the earliest manifestations with mild hyperkalemia (5.5–6.5 mEq/L). With moderate hyperkalemia (6.5–8 mEq/L), a prolonged PR interval, decreased P-wave amplitude, and widening of the QRS complex can be seen. With severe hyperkalemia (>8 mEq/L) there is absence of P-wave, intra- and interventricular conduction blocks, progressive widening of the QRS complex and eventually ventricular fibrillation and asystole. A pseudomyocardial infarction pattern has been described in patients with DKA and hyperkalemia [9–13]. Bellazzini and Meyer reviewed 24 cases of pseudomyocardial infarction in DKA with hyperkalemia reported in the literature [9]. They found that an anteroseptal pattern is the most common presentation (79.2%), followed by a combination of anteroseptal and inferior distribution (12.5%). Of note, 23 of the 24 cases presented with a mean potassium concentration of 8.1 mEq/L. In all these cases, there was no echocardiographic or angiographic finding suggestive of real myocardial ischemia, and there was a complete resolution of electrocardiographic abnormalities after metabolic improvement. There is only one case described in the literature that presented with a pseudomyocardial infarction pattern and normal potassium levels [10]. According to our literature review, no cases of a pseudomyocardial infarction pattern in DKA with mild hyperkalemia have been reported. Possible explanations for the presence of ST-segment elevation in the absence of severe hyperkalemia are the concomitant acid-base disturbances present in our patient, other electrolyte alterations, and possibly a slow coronary blood flow secondary to elevated blood viscosity as a consequence of hyperglycemia [14].We present an uncommon electrocardiographic alteration in a patient with severe DKA. Myocardial infarction should always be considered as a possible precipitant of DKA in diabetic patients, but clinicians must be able to recognize when electrocardiographic abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischemia are related to metabolic derangements in order to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures and treatments and also to promptly recognize those patients with actual ongoing ischemia that may benefit from a coronary percutaneous intervention or IV thrombolysis. Normal levels of myocardial necrosis biomarkers, the absence of echocardiographic and angiographic alterations suggestive of myocardial ischemia, and resolution of electrocardiographic alterations with the metabolic control can be reassuring, but close monitoring of the patient during treatment and after resolution is crucial.The authors declare no conflict of interest to disclose.All authors had full access to data and a role in the preparation of this manuscript.
Recurrent Coronary Thrombus in a Patient with Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia with Treatment Using Eltrombopag

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Background. Eltrombopag, a nonpeptide thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA), has been reported to be an effective therapy for chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). However, a higher incidence of arterial and venous thromboembolic events was reported after using eltrombopag. Case Presentation. A 67-year-old man, treated with eltrombopag due to chronic ITP, was admitted due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Although coronary angiography revealed no occlusion, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging suggested a myocardial infarction in the territory of the left circumflex coronary artery. Three months after the ACS event, the obtuse marginal branches exhibited significant stenosis; hence, a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed to implant a zotarolimus-eluting stent under the treatment of a dual antiplatelet therapy. However, stent thrombosis occurred 3 hours after PCI and required three other PCIs during the eltrombopag treatment. Conclusion. We present a case of an ITP patient, who experienced repeated coronary and stent thrombosis during the treatment with eltrombopag. We propose that the risk of ACS and consequent coronary stent thrombosis should be considered before the introduction of eltrombopag.Chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune syndrome, which is caused by the development of an autoantibody against structural platelets. Although bleeding is a major symptom of ITP, a thrombophilia condition can be promoted in ITP patients by excess activated platelet function. Since platelets play critical roles in the progression of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular events have often been reported in ITP patients. Thus, the safety and recommended strategy in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and subsequent antiplatelet therapies toward ITP patients have remained a matter of debate.Currently available treatments of ITP include corticosteroids, splenectomy, immunosuppressants, and thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA). Eltrombopag, a nonpeptide TPO-RA, has been reported to be effective as a second-line therapy for ITP. However, previous reports indicated a higher incidence of arterial and venous thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction, after using eltrombopag [1]. In this report, we showed a case of recurrent coronary thrombosis in a patient with ITP who was treated with eltrombopag. We also reviewed the previous reports of PCI and antiplatelet therapy, during and after PCI, in ITP patients.A 67-year-old man, who was suffering from long-lasting (>2 hours) severe chest pain, was admitted in our hospital. He was an ex-smoker (between the ages of 20 and 25 years) and had been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was diagnosed with ITP 6 months before admission and maintained his platelet count between 10.0 × 109/L and 15.0 × 109/L by receiving prednisolone (10 mg daily) and eltrombopag (50 mg daily). He was immediately relieved of chest pain after admission, and there was no significant finding on a 12-lead electrocardiogram except a left axis deviation (Figure 1(a)). However, a cardiac catheterization was performed urgently due to the significant increase of serum myocardial enzymes (troponin-I 1.56 ng/mL, creatine kinase (CK) 233 IU/L, and CK-muscle/brain 20 IU/L). Although coronary angiography (CAG) revealed no artery occlusion (Figure 1(b)), left ventriculography showed mild hypokinesis in the posterior wall, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging exhibited a delayed gadolinium enhancement in the posterior wall area (Figure 1(c)), suggesting myocardial infarction in the territory of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX).Because the patient persistently complained of chest pain even after discharge, the second CAG was performed 3 months after the discharge. CAG revealed de novo stenosis in the obtuse marginal branches (#12: 75% with haziness, Figure 2(a)), and adenosine stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (Tc-99m tetrofosmin) showed myocardial ischemia in the posterior wall area (Figure 2(b)), where the tracer uptake was reduced at stress and restored at rest. Thus, the first PCI was planned for #12, and a dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily) was started more than 1 month before the procedure, where his platelet was kept at 27.4 × 109/L by eltrombopag (50 mg daily). The first PCI toward #12 was successfully performed by implantation of a zotarolimus-eluting stent (3.0 × 12 mm) and CAG revealed no residual stenosis (Figure 3(a)). However, the patient complained of severe chest pain with significant ST depression after returning to his hospital room (3 hours after the PCI). The emergent CAG demonstrated a stent thrombosis at the proximal edge of the stent (Figure 3(b)). Although the intravascular ultrasound imaging exhibited neither the underexpansion of the prior-implanted stent nor the coronary artery dissection around the stent, it showed new lining thrombus (white arrows) at the proximal edge of the stent (Figure 3(c)). An additional drug-eluting stent (3.0 × 12 mm, everolimus-eluting stent) was implanted at the proximal edge of the prior stent lesion of #12 (Figure 4(a), second PCI) under the support of an intra-aortic balloon pumping. To avoid further stent thrombosis, the antiplatelet agent was changed from clopidogrel (75 mg daily) to prasugrel (3.75 mg daily). However, CAG, performed 3 days after the second PCI, revealed a massive thrombus with 75% stenosis in #12 (Figure 4(b)). Urokinase (UK 240.000 U) was selectively injected into the LCX, instead of balloon inflation for the third PCI, because recurrent coronary thrombosis was occurring at the area of the dual stent implantation. CAG after the UK injection revealed the residual stenosis (50%) in #12. The follow-up CAG, which was performed 14 days after the third PCI, again revealed the recurrence of stent thrombosis with 75% stenosis in #12 (Figure 4(c)). Subsequently, a coronary thrombus aspiration was performed as the fourth PCI. The final CAG after coronary thrombus aspiration exhibited 50% residual stenosis. Since his platelet maintained at >39.3 × 109/L by eltrombopag during all PCIs, the association between a recurrence of coronary thrombosis and inappropriate platelet increase induced by eltrombopag was suspected. Thus, we transiently ceased eltrombopag, and his platelet promptly decreased to 8.0 × 109/L after 7 days of cessations. CAG, after the cessation of eltrombopag, showed 50% of residual stenosis with thrombus; hence, we did not perform further PCI to #12 (Figure 4(d)). In addition, after he received a splenectomy to cease eltrombopag, he has not complained of any chest pain, and CAG after splenectomy revealed no thrombus in #12.We report a rare case of recurrent coronary thrombosis in a patient with ITP who was treated with eltrombopag. Despite the thrombocytopenic condition, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) events have been reported in ITP patients. ITP patients could experience comorbid thromboembolic events (TEEs) because ITP itself affords an inflammatory condition and promotes an aberrant platelet condition, with larger, younger, and more adherent platelets. In addition, the multifactorial predisposing factors, such as prednisolone treatment and atherosclerotic comorbidities, facilitate the trigger of TEEs.Although eltrombopag has been commonly used as a second-line therapy of ITP, it may enhance the ITP-specific characteristics of thromboembolism, which may increase the incidence of ACS events in ITP patients. Previous reports described cardiac manifestation, such as tachycardia, cyanosis, QT interval prolongation, pulmonary thromboembolism, and ACS after the use of eltrombopag. A pooled data analysis from five eltrombopag RCTs exhibited that the overall TEE rate was 4.5% (27 cases) in the eltrombopag-treated ITP patients, whereas there was none in the placebo groups, and four patients had ACS event [2]. Previously, three ACS events in patients with ITP were reported, which are suspected to be associated with eltrombopag. No association seems to be seen in the ACS event with the treatment duration (1 to 12 months), the platelet counts (107 to 437 × 109/L), and the atherosclerotic risk factors among them [3–5]. Although the mechanism, by which eltrombopag causes ACS event, remains elusive, a rapid platelet increase induced by eltrombopag (0.8 × 109/L to 10.5 × 109/L per month) may affect the ACS events in the present case.Since platelets play critical roles in the progression of atherosclerosis, as well as vascular healing, after stent implantation, PCI and the antiplatelet therapies in ITP patient have been a matter of debate for a long time [6]. The present case showed recurrent coronary thrombosis in the LCX even under dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT—both clopidogrel plus aspirin and prasugrel plus aspirin), suggesting that DAPT may not be effective for activated platelets induced by eltrombopag. Thus, when ITP patients using eltrombopag have a coronary event, it might be safe to avoid any nonurgent PCI. If possible, PCI should be performed with other supporting treatments, such as corticosteroids, splenectomy, and immunosuppressants. Even in an evitable condition, such as ACS, it might be better to avoid any implantation of drug-eluting stent because they might have a poor response to DAPT, which results in repetitive coronary thrombosis. Furthermore, even in ITP patients not receiving eltrombopag treatment, adding eltrombopag before PCI is not recommended. The DAPT treatment for ITP patients has been commonly accepted if ITP patients have a sufficient platelet count (>50 × 109/L) [7]. Even in severe thrombocytopenic conditions, major bleeding was rarely reported in the previous cases [6].Accordingly, when ITP patients present any risk factors for thromboembolism or atherosclerosis, we recommend careful consideration of the risk-benefit balance before the introduction of eltrombopag. Further investigation is required to detect the eltrombopag-specific factors which increase the TEEs.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interests regarding the publication of this manuscript.This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant number JP16K09428 (to M.

A Band That Causes Leaky Valves: Severe Mitral Regurgitation due to Left Atrial Fibrous Band—A Case Report and Literature Review
1Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Newark, NJ, USA2St. George’s University, GrenadaCorrespondence should be addressed to Christopher Nnaoma; moc.liamg@yrracxybbobReceived 31 October 2018; Accepted 29 January 2019; Published 19 March 2019Academic Editor: Ertugrul ErcanCopyright © 2019 Christopher Nnaoma et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Left atrial fibrous band is a rare clinical and echocardiographic finding characterized by the presence of a fibrous band attached to the mitral valve. Diagnosis is accomplished with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), live 3D imaging, or cardiac MRI. Most patients are asymptomatic and incidental findings. However, in rare cases, an atrial fibrous band can produce symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and lightheadedness secondary to mitral regurgitation (MR) which can lead to heart failure if unattended to. More serious complications such as cardioembolic phenomenon can occur. We herein report a case of a 55-year-old male with hypertension who presented with dyspnea on exertion and chest pain. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed mitral valve prolapse with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. TEE showed an atrial fibrous band. Given the patient’s poor exercise tolerance, he was taken to surgery for a mitral annuloplasty.The first case of left atrial fibrous band was reported in 1897 by Rollestone [1]. Left atrial fibrous bands are rare. Autopsy data suggest the prevalence of left atrial bands to be approximately 2% [2]. Its association with MR is exceedingly unique [2]. The clinical importance of these bands in the left atrium is still not clearly defined and should not be confused with the left ventricular false tendon [3]. A better understanding of the natural history and clinical implications of this condition may better help us to diagnose and manage these patients. We present a case of severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation caused by a left atrial fibrous band. The patient had surgical resection of the band and symptoms improved significantly post procedure.In addition to the presented case report, we reviewed the literature to compare the clinical presentation and management of patients with a left atrial fibrous band. The review considered papers and publications written in the English language only. Keywords used for electronic search were left atrial fibrous band and mitral regurgitation. Definitions used for case inclusion were (a) diagnosis of left atrial band either by TTE, TEE, cardiac MRI, live 3D imaging, (b) abnormalities produced by left atrial bands, and (c) age greater than 18 years. Autopsy-reported cases were not included and no studies were excluded based on the date of publication.A 55-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension reports exertional dyspnea for 8 months and nonexertional chest pain for 5 days. Physical exam revealed an afebrile patient; BP of 133/82 mmHg; heart auscultation revealed a new 3/6 systolic murmur, maximal at the apex radiating to the axilla; no leg swelling; and no jugular vein distention. The lungs were clear to auscultation. Pertinent labs were a negative Troponin and BNP. CT angiography and cardiac catheterization were negative. Increased MR with exercise was noted. TTE revealed a moderate to severe posteriorly directed MR which was said to be functional in origin (Carpentier classification III). Ejection fraction (EF) was 45%. TEE showed a structure attached to the atrial surface of the anterior (A2, A3 component) leaflet of the mitral valve (Figure 1), most consistent with a left atrial fibrous band. The distal portion of the band was attached to the interatrial septum in close relation to the aortic valve. The band appeared to restrict the motion of the A2, A3 component with consequent MR, giving it a tented appearance, while 3D live imaging allowed for complete visualization of the band attaching to the mitral valve (Figure 2).Given his poor exercise tolerance, the patient was taken for mitral valve annuloplasty. Intraoperative findings included mitral valve prolapse (MVP), thickened fibrous mitral valve, and MR (Figure 3). The pathology of the fibrous band showed a cardiac valve/vascular wall-like tissue with focal degenerative changes. Three months after the repair, patient’s symptoms improved significantly with good exercise tolerance. There were no audible murmurs. ECHO showed no mitral regurgitation about 3 months after mitral annuloplasty, with an EF of 49% (Figure 4).To the best of our knowledge, fourteen cases of left atrial fibrous band have been described in the literature that met our inclusion criteria. These do not include those found incidentally on autopsy.Table 1 summarizes the baseline demographics and associated clinical significance of these bands. There were ten males, four females, and one of undetermined sex. The mean age was 52.Figure 5 represents a graphical presentation of these left atrial bands and their clinical significance.The most common complication resulting from a left atrial fibrous band was MR which was present in about 37.5% of the cases. Most of the patients with MR progressed to congestive heart failure (CHF). 25% of cases were noted to have cryptogenic stroke and cardiac embolism. 18.7% of cases were noted to have atrial fibrillation (A. Fib) while 6.25% were from supraventricular tachycardia and myocardial infarction. The high incidence of stroke in these patients is likely due to increased incidence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) and A. Fib associated with left atrial fibrous band.A graph showing the incidence of complications associated with left atrial fibrous bands is presented.Intracavitary muscle bands have been well described in all four chambers of the heart. It can be congenital, with no reported gender or racial predilection. Lev (1953) described three forms of abnormal partitioning of the left atrium which are distinguished by the location of the entrance of the venae cava and pulmonary veins [4]. The likely embryological explanation could be that the abnormal septum is likely to be part of the septum primum, which is deviated to the left side to form an extra subdivision of the left atrium [4].Left atrial fibrous bands are said to be a very rare cause of MR. Yamashita et al. reported 22 cases of left atrial fibrous bands from 1,100 patient autopsies [5]. The mechanism of MR associated with left atrial fibrous bands can be due to prolapse (Carpentier type II) or restricted movement (Carpentier type IIIa or b). The incidence of Chiari’s network was 27% in patients with left atrial fibrous band vs. 8% in people without () while 23% had PFO as compared to 8% in people without left atrial fibrous band (). The increased amount of PFO in this group of patients predisposes them to an increased incidence of cardioembolic phenomenon [5]. Also, about 18% of the patients with left atrial fibrous band had A. Fib; this also predisposes them to increased risk of strokes.There have also been four reported cases of cardioembolic events from left atrial bands [6], making up about 25% of cases reported. Most of these bands are either fibrous or fibromuscular. In our patient, the fibrous band may have originated from the atrial septum. These bands are usually congenital and can be found incidentally. The clinical significance of these bands is uncertain [7]; they are mostly asymptomatic. They are however relevant since they can be associated with mitral regurgitation [3, 8], valve cardiomyopathies, atrial fibrillation, conduction disorders, and infectious endocarditis and can interfere with the manipulation of the catheter during invasive procedures [9]. As noted above, these bands are mostly associated with mitral regurgitation, which can lead to heart failure if not treated early.Definite diagnosis of these bands can be done through cardiac imaging modality (transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and 3D live imaging which allow for complete visualization of the band attaching to the mitral valve).In our case, the band was not an incidental finding; the fibrous band likely originated from the atrial septum and produced significant symptom requiring surgical treatment which is the definite treatment. No PFO was noted in our patient.Fibrous bands in the left atrium are rare and extremely rare causes of MR. When they do produce symptoms, they either can be managed medically or surgically depending on the symptoms and severity of MR. Surgery should be deferred in patients who are asymptomatic. Such patients should be followed up closely with scheduled echocardiography. We recommend that PFO be ruled out in these patients given a high associated incidence rate. Anticoagulation should be considered in those with A. Fib and PFO due to increased risk of cardioembolic strokes in these patients until a definite treatment is carried out.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.All authors contributed significantly to this manuscript.
Native Aortic and Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis Complicated by Embolic ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction
1Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, USA2Tower Health System, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Richard Loynd; gro.htlaehrewot@dnyol.drahciRReceived 30 July 2018; Revised 5 October 2018; Accepted 10 February 2019; Published 3 March 2019Academic Editor: Adam TorbickiCopyright © 2019 Mumtaz Zaman et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Acute myocardial infarction due to a coronary embolic event can occur as a complication of infective endocarditis in up to 2.9% of cases and can frequently be the presenting symptom. A 35-year-old female presented with 4 hours of typical chest pain and was found to have ST elevations in inferior leads as well as an elevated serum Troponin I of 8.29 ng/ml (normal: <0.06 ng/ml). Urgent cardiac catheterization revealed total occlusion of the right coronary artery without other coronary disease or collaterals. Following a failed attempt at thrombus extraction, a  bioabsorbable drug-eluting stent was placed. Echocardiography then revealed large mobile aortic valve vegetations with the largest measuring , severe tricuspid regurgitation with a  mobile vegetation on the anterior leaflet along with a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting. Blood cultures identified Enterococcus faecalis in 4 of 4 vials. The patient underwent urgent replacement of tricuspid and aortic valves as well as 6 weeks of IV antibiotics followed by chronic antibiotic suppression.Endocarditis continues to be the fourth most common life-threatening infection, accounting for 1.58 million disability life-years lost globally [1]. While symptoms of bacteremia, peripheral embolization, and vascular phenomena are the classic symptoms of endocarditis, cardiac embolic disease has been reported in up to 60% of patients in autopsy studies [2] and may present antemortem as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in up to 2.9% [3]. Recognition of AMI secondary to embolic disease is critical, as it affects decisions on both pharmacologic and mechanical interventions.A 35-year-old female with a past medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presented to emergency care with 4 hours of continuous sharp midsternal chest pain. At the time of admission, she admitted to intermittent issues with hyperglycemia over the last several weeks as well as night sweats and malaise but denied fever, weight loss, cough, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, or vaginal discharge. There was no history of recent travel, cardiac abnormalities, dental procedures, or exposure to tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Surgical history was pertinent for a Cesarean section performed 3 months prior to admission complicated by postpartum hemorrhage from placental abruption. On exam, she was awake and alert with no respiratory distress. Her vital signs were BP 116/72 mmHg, pulse 97 bpm, temperature 99.7°F, and respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute on room air. The physical examination was normal except for a systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border and a well-healed low transverse Cesarean section incision. Her lab data showed a WBC count of 10,500 c/mm3 (normal: 4,800–10,800 c/mm3), hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dl (normal: 12.0–16.0 g/dl), MCV 84.5 fl (normal: 80.0–9.0 fl), creatinine of 1.58 mg/dl (normal: 0.60–1.30 mg/dl), and Troponin I of 8.29 ng/ml (normal: <0.03 ng/ml). EKG demonstrated ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF consistent with inferior acute myocardial infarction (Figure 1). She was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where she was noted to have a completely occluded right coronary artery (RCA) (Figure 2). Consistency of the occlusion and absence of calcium suggested acute thrombus or embolus. An aspiration was attempted but was unsuccessful, so a  bioabsorbable drug-eluting stent was placed into the RCA along with balloon dilation of the proximal aspects of the posterior descending artery and distal RCA (Figure 3). Left-sided coronaries were angiographically normal (Figure 4). A postcatheterization transthoracic echocardiogram then revealed large mobile aortic valve vegetations on all 3 leaflets with the largest measuring , moderate aortic insufficiency, severe tricuspid regurgitation with a  mobile vegetation on the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve, and moderate mitral regurgitation without lesions. Ejection fraction was estimated at 50% with inferior and inferolateral wall hypo/akinesis. These findings were later confirmed with transesophageal echocardiogram, which also identified a patent foramen ovale with continuous right-to-left shunt (Figures 5 and 6). Chest CT imaging noted no embolic disease.Blood cultures grew Enterococcus faecalis in 4 of 4 vials. Vancomycin and ceftriaxone were initiated and the patient was transferred to an outside facility where she underwent urgent cardiac surgery with the placement of bioprosthetic aortic and tricuspid valves, as well as PFO closure. Bioprosthetic valves were used as per patient preference. Cultures of removed cardiac tissue were positive for Enterococcus faecalis. No evidence of aortic root abscess was noted during the surgery. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was unrevealing for sepsis source. Endocarditis was ultimately attributed to prior placental abruption.After valve replacement, she was continued on IV antibiotics. Blood cultures cleared, and on hospital day 15, she was discharged on IV ampicillin and ceftriaxone for synergy. Three weeks after discharge, a repeat ECHO revealed an ejection fraction of 47% and severe hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior wall with normal function of both aortic and tricuspid bioprosthetic valves. After completing 6 weeks of IV antibiotic therapy, she was transitioned to chronic oral suppression with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. At phone follow-up 6 months later, the patient reported tolerating oral suppressive antibiotic with no clinical signs or symptoms of recurrent infection or complications.While most acute myocardial infarctions are secondary to atherosclerotic heart disease, the differential also includes less common nonatherosclerotic causes. These include vasculitis, congenital coronary artery abnormalities, vasospasm, coronary embolism, and coronary artery extrinsic compression by either abscess or pseudoaneurysm [2, 4]. Since the initial description of coronary emboli by Dr. Virchow in 1856 [5], embolic infarction due to infective endocarditis (IE) has remained an underrecognized entity. Sudden onset embolic infarctions are believed to occur in 2.9% of all cases of infective endocarditis [3] and are associated with very high rates of subsequent heart failure (73%) [4] and death (64%) [3].Presentation with embolic AMI typically occurs within 2 weeks of a known diagnosis of endocarditis [6] but can be the initial presenting symptom in up to 54% of cases [4]. Identified risks for AMI in IE include larger (>1 cm) vegetations, mobile vegetations, and the presence of a valve ring aortic abscess [3, 7]. However, both aortic and mitral valves are associated with AMI. Our case was unusual in that we identified a tricuspid valve vegetation and a PFO with right-to-left shunting without pulmonary infarction or emboli. This suggests that the tricuspid valve was likely infected first, then bypassing the pulmonary circulation through the PFO, led to the infection of the aortic valve, which has only been suspected once before [8].Clinical findings at cardiac catheterization that suggest embolic disease include abrupt and complete occlusion in a single coronary artery, especially in the absence of other coronary plaques and the absence of collateral blood flow. The management of these infected emboli remains unclear. Thrombolytics seem to release previously walled-off vegetations on valves, resulting in cerebral embolic showers followed by serious intracranial bleeds and the worsening of infection in both animal models [9] and in human case reports [10] and are therefore not recommended. Catheter-based therapies such as angioplasty, PCI, and embolectomy have also been used. Angioplasty is often immediately unsuccessful due to the lack of plaque to expand the vessel lumen, leading to rapid reocclusion [11]. PCI has been shown to be more effective immediately; however, it carries the risk of stent infection and, along with angioplasty, the risk of mycotic aneurysm with ultimate concern for coronary artery rupture and sudden death [12]. Per ACC guidelines, valve replacement is recommended in patients with recurrent emboli (Class IIa recommendation) or heart failure (Class I indication) [13].While the diagnosis of AMI due to embolic IE remains rare, it is important to consider as treatment and clinical course vary significantly from atherosclerotic AMI. When presented with a young patient without typical risk factors for coronary heart disease, with early fevers, or history of endocarditis, physicians should consider an urgent TEE for evaluation of IE [3], which has a sensitivity of 93% for detecting valvular vegetations [14]. Once diagnosed, we endorse a multidisciplinary approach [4] and propose systemic antibiotics with or without emergent PCI as a bridge to possible surgical valve replacement. Further studies are recommended to help guide future therapy options.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Cocaine-Induced Pneumopericardium: Safe for Discharge? A Case Report and Literature Review
1Department of Cardiology, ZNA Middelheim, Antwerp, Belgium2Emergency Department, ZNA Middelheim, Antwerp, Belgium3Emergency Department, University Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, UKCorrespondence should be addressed to Xavier Galloo; eb.ca.buv@oollagxReceived 10 October 2018; Revised 6 January 2019; Accepted 31 January 2019; Published 20 February 2019Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2019 Xavier Galloo et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 29-year-old male presented at the Emergency Department (ED) with chest pain and neck tenderness after intranasal cocaine usage. Physical exam of the patient demonstrated moderate subcutaneous emphysema on the right side of his neck. The ECG did not demonstrate any changes associated with cocaine-induced cardiac ischemia, and blood analysis was normal (negative troponins). A chest X-ray revealed subtle evidence of pneumomediastinum. Subsequent thoracic CT confirmed the presence of subcutaneous emphysema with a pneumopericardium and a large pneumomediastinum along with a small pneumothorax. The patient was managed conservatively and kept overnight for observation. He was discharged from the ED the following day with ambulatory follow-up. A repeat thoracic CT performed two weeks later demonstrated that the findings identified in the first CT had resolved. Pneumopericardium, -mediastinum, and -thorax are rare conditions reported after cocaine abuse. A conservative approach with a period of observation in a suitable ambulatory unit is acceptable, as current literature suggests that the condition is usually self-limiting.The widespread abuse of cocaine has led to an increase in the frequency of Emergency Department (ED) visits worldwide. The respiratory and cardiovascular effects associated with cocaine abuse are well established with increasing numbers reported in the literature. The most common complaint reported by patients is chest pain [1, 2].Cocaine activates the sympathetic nervous system leading to vasoconstriction, elevated arterial blood pressure, tachycardia, and arrhythmias. The most frequent cardiovascular complications reported are acute myocardial infarction and cardiac tachyarrhythmias. Pneumomediastinum and -thorax after cocaine abuse are reported infrequently, and of note, pneumopericardium is very rare [1, 3].A 29-year-old male (weight: 58 kg, length: 178 cm, BMI: 18.3 kg/m2; BMI normal range: 18.5 kg/m2 – 25 kg/m2), without significant past medical history, presented at the ED with chest pain and localised neck tenderness. He presented with sudden onset retrosternal chest pain. The pain was described as “mild and continuous” with no radiation or any other associated symptoms (i.e., no dyspnea or cough; no nausea or vomiting). There was no history of preceding trauma, and the patient had no previous medical history of note. Apart from a 5 pack-year history of smoking cigarettes, there were no other cardiovascular risk factors.The patient did not take regular medication but admitted to marijuana use on a weekly basis as a teenager until the age of 25. He then only used marijuana infrequently (on average once a month). With regard to cocaine, he admitted he had used it twice—the first being a year ago, and the second time a day prior to attending the ED. There was no history of any other recreational drug use.Following intranasal cocaine inhalation at an evening social gathering, he suffered chest pain and palpitations. In an attempt to ease the chest pain, he smoked a premixed marijuana/tobacco joint (approximately 0.32 grams marijuana [4]). The joint was smoked as per a normal cigarette technique without prolonged inhalation or Valsalva manoeuvres.The following morning, he continued to experience retrosternal chest pain, which had since increased in intensity. He now noticed the presence of right-sided neck pain but without muscle tenderness, throat pain, or dyspnea. Despite taking 1 gram of paracetamol, the symptoms were no better and he therefore presented to the ED.His vital signs were within normal parameters (temperature: 36.1°C, heart rate: 65 bpm, blood pressure: 125/75 mmHg, equal bilaterally with no pulsus paradoxus, respiratory rate: 13/min, oxygen saturation 100% on room air with a GCS of 15/15).On physical examination, respiratory auscultation was normal without additional sounds; cardiac sounds were unremarkable with no murmurs or clear “Hamman’s sign” (a crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat. It is best heard over the precordium and is suggestive for pneumopericardium or -mediastinum) [5–7]. A moderate amount of subcutaneous emphysema on the right side of the neck was noted. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.Blood analysis was normal (normal haematology and biochemical analysis, normal inflammatory markers and troponins <0.012 ng/mL). Arterial blood gas on room air demonstrated a respiratory alkalosis without metabolic compensation (pH 7.50, pCO2 29.3 mmHg, pO2 119.7 mmHg, base excess 0.3 mmol/L, HCO3- 22.2 mmol/L, saturation 98.2%, and lactate 1.3 mmol/L). ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without ST-elevation with normal repolarisation. A chest X-ray showed subtle evidence of pneumomediastinum and right-sided mild subcutaneous emphysema in the neck (Figure 1(a), thick arrow) with air tracking in the centre of the mediastinum (Figure 1(a), thin arrow). There is a small denser line along the right cardiomediastinal margin (Figure 2) that is often present in normal X-rays and is attributed to an optical illusion known as the Mach Band effect (a visual pattern due to edge enhancement manifesting as a region of lucency adjacent to convex surfaces). Although it can be normal, taken in association with subcutaneous emphysema and air tracking in the centre of a mediastinum, this is suggestive of a pneumomediastinum [8].As subcutaneous emphysema along with the suggestion of pneumomediastinum was identified on the chest X-ray, further workup with thoracic CT-scan was performed. This confirmed the presence of subcutaneous emphysema with a pneumopericardium, a large pneumomediastinum, and a small pneumothorax (Figure 1(b), Figure 3). The patient was managed conservatively and kept overnight for observation (continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring with two-hourly blood pressure measurement in addition to pain control titrated to a pain Visual Analogue Scale). A combination of paracetamol and tramadol was sufficient to keep the patient pain free. The following day, his clinical parameters remained within normal limits along with the resolution of chest pain and a largely unremarkable physical examination. He was discharged the next day with expectative approach, oral analgesics, and ambulatory follow-up. Repeat CT after two weeks revealed complete resolution of the free intrathoracic air.Spontaneous pneumopericardium, -mediastinum, and -thorax are rare conditions that have been reported following cocaine abuse, but diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines remain open to debate. The current ESC (European Society of Cardiology) guidelines for pericardial diseases do not describe the management of pneumopericardium in this context [9, 10]. Pneumopericardium is an extremely rare complication of cocaine abuse with only 9 published cases to the best of our knowledge [11–18]. It is unclear what the incidence, or indeed the relationship, between the use of cocaine and spontaneous pneumopericardium is. A study with a systematic toxicology screening in patients presenting with spontaneous pneumopericardium/pneumothorax might shed some light on this.Pneumopericardium, -mediastinum, and -thorax are defined as the presence of “free” air in the pericardium, the mediastinum, or the pleural cavity, respectively [7, 19]. Where there is no clear aetiology, it is referred to as spontaneous/primary, and secondary when a specific pathologic event (trauma, infection, and iatrogenic) is thought to be causative [6]. Cocaine-related pneumopericardium, -mediastinum, and -thorax are considered as spontaneous or primary as determining the precise aetiology of “free” air is challenging and its mechanism remains unanswered.It is unclear whether the pathophysiology of pneumopericardium is that of pulmonary barotrauma or microscopic tracheal/oesophageal tear due to the solid contaminants in the crystalline mass inhaled or snorted by the patient [11, 15]. Pulmonary barotrauma, also known as the Macklin effect, can be explained by a three-step process: alveolar rupture due to an abrupt increase in intra-alveolar pressure leading to air dissection along bronchovascular sheaths, with eventual spread to the pulmonary interstitium and the mediastinal and pericardial cavity [7, 20–22]. This is thought to be the result of either a sudden increase in intrathoracic pressure due to rapid nasal inhalation, coughing, sneezing, and vomiting or deep, forced, and prolonged inhalation with a Valsalva’s manoeuvre [1, 3].The patient denied any coughing, vomiting, prolonged inhalation, or Valsalva’s manoeuvre. Our hypothesis is that the pneumopericardium, -mediastinum, and -thorax in this patient were the result of a sudden rise in intra-alveolar pressure due to cocaine inhalation. As the chest pain preceded the smoking of marijuana, it is believed that marijuana was far less likely to be the cause of the pneumopericardium, -mediastinum, and -thorax.In the published literature, the majority of the patients presenting with spontaneous pneumopericardium and/or pneumomediastinum are young thin males without previous medical history, much like this patient. The most frequent complaint described is chest pain, followed by neck pain, dyspnea, and cough. Less frequent symptoms are odynophagia, hoarseness, and feeding problems [7, 9, 15, 17]. Emergency physicians should be alert for patients presenting with these symptoms as they have a considerable higher risk of developing pneumopericardium and/or pneumomediastinum.Spontaneous pneumopericardium and -mediastinum can be diagnosed on plain chest X-ray; although, thoracic CT remains the gold standard for radiological investigations. A CT-scan can also be helpful in excluding secondary/other causes of pneumopericardium. Further invasive diagnostic studies are not normally needed in spontaneous pneumomediastinum and should only be performed in highly suspicious cases of oesophageal or tracheal rupture [9]. There have been no reports of oesophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) associated with cocaine-induced pathology. As our patient did not complain of gastrointestinal symptoms, there was no indication for invasive diagnostics such as oesophagoscopy/gastroscopy or bronchoscopy. Where tamponade due to the pneumopericardium is suspected bedside, echocardiography may be useful in evaluating such patients. As our patient remained stable throughout the entire observation with no evidence of pulsus paradoxus, echocardiography was not required.Some guidelines for spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum recommend a conservative approach with outpatient follow-up in selected patients with minimal or no symptoms. These patients should receive clear advice to return in case of worsening dyspnea, chest pain, or fever [19, 23]. The treatment of spontaneous pneumopericardium is not clearly defined due to the rarity of its presentation. It is generally considered a benign condition, which responds well to conservative treatment, consisting of bed rest, oxygen therapy, and analgesia. All reported cases treated conservatively have resulted in complete resolution over a period of one to two weeks. Oxygen therapy should be considered as its use increases the diffusion pressure of nitrogen in the interstitium, promoting the absorption of free air in the mediastinum and possibly in the pericardium [7, 9]. In the referenced literature, there were no reports of patients developing pericarditis or mediastinitis. Antibiotic treatment should only be considered in patients at risk for infective pericarditis (presenting with fever, blood sample showing elevated inflammatory parameters, or pneumopericarditis secondary to oesophageal rupture) and should not normally be given empirically [9].Cocaine-related complaints are increasingly seen in the ED as cocaine abuse increases in the community. The most common complaint of cocaine abuse is chest pain. Although pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax after cocaine abuse has been reported, they are infrequent complications; pneumopericardium is even less common and poorly documented. Whilst the emergency physician is familiar with the most common causes (acute myocardial ischemia or arrhythmia) of chest pain after cocaine abuse, they should be aware of other rarer causes. Patients meeting the criteria of a young thin male with no previous medical history are at increased risk of developing pneumopericardium and/or pneumomediastinum. When the ECG shows no signs of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmia and serial cardiac marker testing are negative in asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic, patients with spontaneous pneumopericardium, a short observation with monitoring in a Chest Pain Unit is advised to follow-up or promptly exclude and treat life-threatening complications (i.e. tension pneumothorax or tamponade) early, followed by an expectative approach, since most patients will have spontaneous resolution within one or two weeks.Each case needs to be managed on its own merits based upon the history, physical examination, investigations, clinical course of the patient, and clinical judgment of the treating physician. In some cases, prolonged observation may be necessary.The authors report no declarations of interest.Xavier Galloo contributed in the acquisition and analysis/interpretation of data, drafting, and revision of the article.

105 Inappropriate ICD Shocks in a Patient with Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Broca’s Aphasia
Heart Center Brandenburg-Department of Cardiology and Medical School Brandenburg Theodor Fontane, Bernau bei Berlin, GermanyCorrespondence should be addressed to Christian Georgi; ed.leunammi@igroeg.cReceived 24 October 2018; Revised 16 December 2018; Accepted 27 December 2018; Published 14 February 2019Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2019 Christian Georgi et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.With a growing number of ICD recipients, device complications are seen more frequently in the clinical setting and outpatient departments. Among the most severe are ICD infections and inappropriate therapies caused by oversensing of atrial tachycardias or lead fracture. We report on a 76-year-old female patient with dilative cardiomyopathy and Broca’s aphasia after stroke, who experienced 105 consecutive inappropriate ICD shocks due to cluster missensing of her fractured ICD lead. The diagnosis was complicated and delayed by patient’s aphasia emphasizing the need for intensified remote monitoring along with regular in-person visits, especially in people with intellectual or communication disabilities.The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been proven to be an effective therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death [1].Yet inappropriate ICD therapies, mainly due to oversensing or SVTs, remain a great problem in device therapy. A lately published meta-analysis reports of inappropriate therapies in around 10% of patients with ICDs within the first year after implantation [2]. It is well known that ICD shocks, both appropriate and inappropriate, have a negative impact on morbidity and mortality [3, 4].Beyond mortality rates, ICD shocks, especially inappropriate therapies, are found to cause a decline in the quality of life and reduced daily activity and increased general anxiety in postshock patients [5].A reduction of inappropriate therapies therefore should be achieved by intensive treatment of the underlying disease, optimal ICD programming, and close monitoring of patients at high risk.In this context, remote monitoring (RM) is a promising complement to conventional in-clinic follow-ups with the potential to dramatically reduce inappropriate therapies [6], although structural deficits concerning data overload, functional responsibility, and imprecise workflows need to be improved. In particular, for people in rural areas, in patients with impaired mobility or mental status, RM offers the chance for improved safety and quality of life. So far, remote control has not been fully implemented in the follow-up of ICD patients in Northern America and Europe, though [7].We report on an aphasic patient with more than one hundred inappropriate shocks within a few hours that could have been prevented by more frequent expert consultations and connecting her to a remote monitoring program.A 76-year-old female patient was admitted to our emergency department early in the morning with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The patient had suffered from a major stroke causing Broca’s aphasia three months prior to this admission and was referred to us from a nearby neurorehabilitation clinic. Initial ECG showed no signs of acute ischemia, but troponin I levels were about 1000-fold elevated. History taking was complicated by patient’s aphasia, but she did not appear to be in acute pain at the time of admission.With a history of heart failure and an implanted single-chamber ICD, the patient was brought to the catheter lab to undergo coronary angiogram, where no culprit lesion could be detected (Figure 1).In a phone consultation with the rehab clinic’s doctor in charge, he described how the patient had multiple episodes of acute chest and back pain with “electrical twitches” for the course of several hours during the past night. Pain medication was administered and the pain interpreted as musculoskeletal but no other diagnostic or therapeutic steps were taken. Eventually, in the morning, a troponin test was done and found positive, so the patient was referred.Subsequently, we performed an ICD interrogation, which revealed an EOS (end of service) status and multiple inappropriate ICD therapies in the time between 00:07 AM and 03:46 AM until the battery of the Biotronik ICD was depleted and the device eventually stopped antitachycardia therapy. In summary, the patient suffered 105 consecutive inappropriate ICD shocks within 219 minutes (Figure 2), to our knowledge, the highest shock incidence in such a short period of time. The shocks were caused by cluster missensing on her right ventricular lead (Figure 3), presumably resulting from an insulation defect near the header. Further episodes of oversensing due to clusters could be seen over the preceding five months, occasionally followed by antitachycardia pacing but no shock therapy.The ICD was implanted in 2008 and exchanged for EOL (end of life) in 2015. The last ambulatory interrogation was in September 2016, just before the first episodes of cluster missensing occurred. The next appointment was scheduled for March 2017 but postponed due to the prolonged hospital stay after apoplexy. The technical analysis of the explanted ICD did not show any technical abnormalities; the chest X-ray revealed no sign of lead fracture.After discussing the case with patient’s family, the defective lead was disconnected, and at the request of the patient and her family, a new ICD and lead were implanted and the patient enrolled in our remote monitoring program.Since the first transvenous ICD was implanted in 1980 [8], there is a steadily growing number of ICD implantations and patients with long-lasting devices [9]. In the year 2023, there is an estimated 1.4 million pacemaker and ICD implantations worldwide [10]. Simultaneously, the lead- and generator-associated complications increased over the last years. Lead-associated complications include thrombosis and infection as well as fracture and insulation problems with the risk of inappropriate therapies. From large clinical trials, we know that about 5-20% of patients with ICDs receive inappropriate therapy, mainly due to the missensing of supraventricular arrhythmias, oversensing of external noise, or lead fracture/insulation defects [4]. The psychological impact of inappropriate ICD shocks was investigated in several studies. Among the most frequent side effects are anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorders, panic attacks, depression, nightmare, and insomnia [11].This case demonstrates possible pitfalls of ICD supply in elderly or handicapped people. The inability of the patient to communicate properly and missing awareness of the staff led to the dreadful course of events. The suspected short circuit between the lead and the scorched battery (Figure 4) might have reduced the current delivered to the whole body and weakened the pain; still the delay in therapy was unnecessary and avoidable. Immediate ECG monitoring would have helped to discover the cause for shock delivery and could have led to shock suppression by simply applying a magnet.Retrospectively, the earlier access to remote monitoring could have prevented the massive amount of shocks, since the first asymptomatic cluster episodes could be detected already some months before the incident described. A significant reduction of the “first-incidence-to-action time” through remote monitoring has been described by many authors [12–14]. The TRUST study demonstrated a median delay of 1 day from occurrence of the event to physician evaluation, compared to 1 month with conventional follow-up [15]. They also confirmed a cost benefit from an economical perspective. Still the need for additional manpower to analyze the huge amount of data, legal issues, and lack of standardization remain open problems [16].Regular in-person visits with cardiologists remain the foundation of appropriate ICD follow-up. Remote monitoring programs, though, are a very useful tool to supplement conventional follow-up and should be established whenever suitable. The transmission of technical data to experts is known to be very effective to detect early malfunctions of implantable devices as ICDs and pacemakers. This clearly helps to avoid inappropriate therapies, detects lead and battery problems, and discovers atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias.An increasing number of patients with ICDs, pacemakers, and CRTs require sufficient manpower and technical resources to guarantee high-quality monitoring. Moreover, further training programs for outpatient departments and GPs should be installed since there is a significant lack of knowledge concerning ICD function and troubleshooting.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Submitral Aneurysm in a Patient with a Normal Electrocardiogram

The submitral or posterolateral ventricular aneurysm is a very rare variety, usually of congenital etiology, which may also have other causes, including ischemic heart disease. The present case is about a 76-year-old male with the antecedent of an acute myocardial infarction 3 years ago. He presented with intermittent, brief, and self-limiting episodes of severe dyspnea, intense desperation, and accelerated palpitations, with a nonspecific electrocardiogram. An echocardiography revealed a large submitral aneurysm, with a good clinical response to the specific treatment of heart failure, antiarrhythmics, and oral anticoagulation therapy. We analyze the implications of an aneurysm in the context of an ischemic etiology, with special attention to the limitations of the electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of occlusions of the circumflex artery that irrigates the posterolateral region of the heart. We suspect that a greater number of patients with a culprit circumflex artery could receive appropriate coronary interventionism or thrombolysis if decision-making in the emergency room would not depend mainly on the electrocardiogram. Better stratification tools are needed to prevent late complications of infarction, such as those observed in this patient.Prior to current modern treatment of acute coronary syndromes, it was estimated that a ventricular aneurysm (VA) developed in 30-35% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with an elevated ST-T segment. With the advent of fibrinolysis and coronary angioplasty, the incidence of VA has decreased to 8-15% [1]. The most common etiology of these aneurysms is ischemic heart disease, although there may be other causes.According to the Mexican Health Secretary, 70-85% of VAs occur in the apical and anterior region of the left ventricle, whereas the lateral wall is the least common location [1]. Also worldwide, VAs most often involve the apex (31.7%), the posterior wall (23.8%), and the anterior wall (9.5%), but only 1% of cardiac aneurysms affect the lateral region of the left ventricle and these aneurysms tend to be small-sized [2].The clinical importance of VA ranges from asymptomatic to potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias; sometimes, there are signs and symptoms of heart failure or episodes of arterial embolism.We present the case of a septuagenarian male patient who was evaluated at a private cardiology clinic because of frequent and severe paroxysmal symptoms of heart failure and palpitations, which were strikingly brief and self-limiting, with nonspecific findings in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Finally, a VA with an unusual submitral or posterolateral location was detected by echocardiography.A 76-year-old Mexican man, from the state of San Luis Potosí, Mexico, was examined at a private cardiology clinic in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon in April 2018 because of episodes of excessive dry cough, severe dyspnea, and accelerated palpitations as of the previous day. These episodes were frequent and of sudden onset and short duration, without angina, lipothymia, or syncope. He was asymptomatic between episodes.There were no nonpathological antecedents of importance; he had worked as a farmer until his retirement; he did not smoke nor consume alcohol or drugs; and he was neither diabetic nor hypertensive. The only personal pathological antecedent of interest was a hospitalization due to an AMI 3 years ago, which had been attended in the patient’s native state. Access to his medical file was not an option at the moment of the consult.Upon arrival at the clinic, he was calm and symptom-free. However, at the start of the clinical interview, he suddenly presented a new episode of severe dyspnea accompanied by intense desperation, which lasted less than 1 minute, after which he remained calm and asymptomatic. The physical examination did not yield relevant data, except for arrhythmic heart sounds due to premature beats. The pulmonary fields were considered clean and well-ventilated, abdominal visceromegalies were not found, and no edema was detected in the lower limbs. The blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, the heart rate 76 bpm, and the respiratory rate 20 respirations per minute.The initial ECG revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 55 bpm, PR 0.18, QRS 0.08, AQRS at -30 degrees, and tracing without significant abnormalities (Figure 1). A ventricular arrhythmia was suspected, but a 24 h Holter monitoring was discarded because of the apparent urgency of the situation. Instead, a color Doppler echocardiography was performed immediately. The echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 34% and a large submitral aneurysm in the posterolateral basal-medial region of the left ventricle, as well as severe anterior and inferior basal-medial hypokinesia, mild mitral valve insufficiency, and no pulmonary artery hypertension (Figures 2 and 3).As the patient presented symptoms of intermittent heart failure probably due to paroxysmal tachycardia, which, in the context of a cardiac posterolateral submitral VA (SVA), could be potentially lethal, medical treatment was initiated with spironolactone (50 mg/day), furosemide (20 mg/day), amiodarone (200 mg every 12 hours for 2 weeks and then a single 200-mg dose daily), nitroglycerin patches (5 mg/day), and apixaban (5 mg every 12 hours, orally).On a control visit three weeks later, the patient had no cardiovascular symptoms (New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I) and had not experienced recurrence of palpitations nor episodes of sudden dyspnea. The laboratory blood values were as follows: hemoglobin, 16.4 gr/dL; leukocytes, 7,400/mm3; platelets, 261,000/mm3; glucose, 108 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.16 mg/dL; uric acid, 5.5 mg/dL; total cholesterol, 207 mg/dL; triglycerides, 147 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), 144.3 mg/dL; and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), 51 mg/dL. Hepatic function tests and serum electrolytes were normal, except for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level (45 mIU/mL). Urinalysis was without significant abnormalities: pH, 7.5 and density, 1.010. The posteroanterior chest radiograph (Figure 4) revealed grade II cardiomegaly with a rounded growth on a left profile, compatible with VA, without further abnormalities.Levothyroxine (first week, 50 μg/day; from second week onwards, 75 μg/day) and simvastatin (20 mg/day) were added to the treatment. With this therapeutic scheme, the patient remained asymptomatic until August 2018, month of the last follow-up visit at this private clinic. At the beginning of this month, the last monitored TSH level was 7.48 mUI/mL. The good clinical response to treatment and the tendency to a sinus bradycardia did not seem to justify the inclusion of beta-blockers.The patient, with low economic resources, will continue his follow-up and treatment at a third-level public hospital in Monterrey, Mexico. Cardiac gammagraphy, cardiac catheterization, and electrophysiological monitoring were recommended.SVA is a peculiar pathology, which is rarely detected worldwide. The majority of cases occur in the African population and in a lesser proportion in the Indian population [3, 4]. SVA can be defined as a dilation of the ventricle and a thinning of the ventricular wall below the mitral valve apparatus, due to a weak union of the cardiac muscle to the fibrous tissue adjacent to the posterolateral mitral valve. Most often, there is a congenital etiology, but any of the following may be an alternative cause: infection, for example, tuberculosis and endocarditis; inflammation as in rheumatic fever or Takayasu disease; neoplasia; post-AMI; and idiopathic causes [5, 6]. Patients with this problem may be asymptomatic or have symptoms of heart failure, palpitations, lipothymia, syncope, or sudden death, in addition to systemic embolic phenomena. The ECG often shows nonspecific findings, unlike VA cases due to ischemia of the apical or anterior wall, which are detected by a persistent ST-T segment elevation and the presence of Q waves in electrocardiographic derivations corresponding to the affected area. In fact, localization of aneurysms in the posterolateral region of the left ventricle, as in the present case, is very rare.The initial objective when detecting a SVA is to corroborate an ischemic etiology and rule out other potential causes.The therapy goal is to offer interventional or surgical treatment of coronary vessels with critical lesions and/or myocardial ischemia and viability, resection of the SVA, or, if surgery seems too risky, a cardioverter defibrillator implant.Considering that this case concerns a senile patient with a clinical history of hospitalization due to an AMI 3 years ago, combined with the echocardiographic findings of segmental alterations of left ventricle mobility in regions other than the VA area, it seems most probable that ischemia had caused this SVA, although a congenital or other origin cannot be ruled out completely. It is known that 40% to 50% of the occlusions of the circumflex left coronary artery (LCA) in the context of myocardial infarction do not alter the ST-T segment in the ECG [7]. The ECG, therefore, is insufficient to detect a narrowing or occlusion of the LCA and can lead to a wrong classification of risk and a delay in the performance of coronary angiography and interventional procedures [8]. This situation probably applies to this case. Patients with an AMI due to an occluded LCA tend to have a worse evolution than patients with an occluded right coronary artery. Among other reasons, this could be because of a delay in the establishment of fibrinolytic or interventional reperfusion therapy in cases with an ECG with nonspecific findings, which is more common when the culprit occlusion occurs in the LCA [9]. Finally, supposing that the posterolateral SVA of this case is due to ischemia, the issue that deserves attention is the inadequate procedure of risk stratification of emergency room patients with chest pain and a suspect of cardiac ischemia. Up to 10% of patients with thoracic pain and the suspicion of cardiac ischemia are dismissed because of a normal ECG but return within 24 to 48 hours with an established AMI and are no longer within the therapeutic window for fibrinolytic or interventional reperfusion therapy [10].In clinical practice, the LCA is the least frequent culprit vessel among patients treated invasively for AMI. Patients with LCA occlusion may present an acute non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and require emergency coronary intervention [11]. The consequences of this inadequate risk stratification, based mainly on a normal ECG but without considering an adequate semiology of chest pain, which should include studies such as troponin levels, echocardiography, and nuclear medicine studies, can lead to a substantial delay in reperfusion therapy and the appearance of late complications such as VA.SVA, usually congenital in origin and peculiar for its rare occurrence and particular anatomical location in the heart, may also be of ischemic origin. Occlusions of the circumflex artery as a culprit lesion of myocardial infarction, often invisible in an ECG, could lead to the development of VA in elderly patients whom were not treated timely with coronary reperfusion therapy. This case demonstrates the need to improve clinical risk categorization strategies in patients evaluated for chest pain in an emergency service.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Brugada Syndrome Caused by Autonomic Dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis
1Department of Internal Medicine, Jackson Memorial Hospital/University of Miami Hospital, Miami, FL, USA2Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, FL, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Michel Ibrahim; moc.liamg@lehcimiharbiReceived 4 January 2018; Revised 18 April 2018; Accepted 10 December 2018; Published 7 February 2019Academic Editor: Domingo A. Pascual-FigalCopyright © 2019 Michel Ibrahim et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Only one case report has previously described a patient with multiple sclerosis and a type 1 Brugada pattern on the electrocardiogram. Patients with multiple sclerosis have several neurological deficits including sensory symptoms, acute or subacute motor weakness, gait disturbance, and balance problems that may lead to an increased risk of falls. Concurrent autonomic dysfunction and neurologic consequences of multiple sclerosis may precipitate both mechanical falls and falls with loss of consciousness. While mechanistically different, the type 1 Brugada pattern presents similarly with syncope due to an insufficient cardiac output during dysrhythmia. In such patients, intracardiac defibrillators have shown to prevent sudden cardiac death in patients with the Brugada syndrome. In light of these similarly presenting but unique clinical entities, MS patients who develop a syncopal event in the setting of a spontaneous type I Brugada pattern pose a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. This case illustrates an approach to the risks and benefits of an ICD placement in an MS patient with the type 1 Brugada pattern.The Brugada syndrome (BruS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with variable expression characterized by typical electrocardiogram (ECG) findings with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death [1]. It is essential to distinguish BruS and Brugada sign (BrS) which are two terms distinguishable by the presence or absence of symptoms. Patients with BrS are asymptomatic and have no other clinical criteria. This distinction aids in decision-making for appropriate management.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that leads to the diffuse destruction of the nervous tissue [2]. Its associations with cardiac complications have been extensively described [3]: these lesions may ultimately affect regulation of the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS), thus causing orthostatic signs and symptoms. MS can also present with gait instability, neuropathic pain, ataxia, and weakness, which all may increase the risk for falls.We describe a case of a patient with multiple sclerosis presenting to the hospital after experiencing an episode of questionable syncope and ST segment elevation on the ECG that was found to have BrS.BruS is diagnosed in symptomatic patients with a pseudo right bundle branch block and ST segment abnormality characteristic of type 1 morphology with a 2 mm or more elevation in the leads V1 and V2 on the ECG (Figure 1). This may occur either spontaneously or in patients with type 2 or 3 patterns during a provocative drug test with intravenous administration of class I antiarrhythmic drugs. Documented ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic VT, syncope of a probable arrhythmic cause, or a family history of sudden cardiac death [4, 5] together with a spontaneous or induced type I Brugada pattern make the diagnosis of BruS.Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system can cause lightheadedness, dizziness, orthostatic intolerance, tachycardia or bradycardia, blood pressure fluctuations, and bowel or bladder dysfunction. In MS, cardiovascular dysfunction is mainly due to ANS dysfunction from overall demyelinating plaque burden in the medulla disrupting reflex pathways from higher cortical centers. Alternatively, there may be interference as the descending autonomic pathways course through the brainstem and spinal cord [6]. ANS dysfunction explains the orthostatic symptoms including syncope, near syncope, and orthostatic hypotension that have previously been reported in MS patients [7, 8]. Cardiovascular abnormalities may be clinical or subclinical and can also lead to sudden death in some cases [7].In our literature search, there has been only one previously reported case of the type 1 Brugada pattern on the ECG in an asymptomatic patient with multiple sclerosis [9]. The authors stipulated that the only abnormality that could be linked to such an ECG finding is the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), due to lesions in the brain and spine. There is evidence that an imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems contributes significantly to the pathophysiology of the Brugada syndrome [10].This is a 60-year-old right-handed man with past medical history of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis diagnosed 20 years ago with prior beta interferon treatment for 8 years and with chronic left residual hemiparesis who presented to the emergency room after experiencing generalized weakness followed by a fall to the ground with apparent loss of consciousness. While the patient reported no loss of consciousness, he did not have memory of the events surrounding the fall. EMS was called and patient was airlifted to the nearest percutaneous intervention-capable center after the ECG showed a ST segment elevation in the leads V1 to V3, so the ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) alert was activated. In the emergency department, the patient was without chest pain. Upon further questioning, he denied any family history of heart disease including no cardiomyopathy, heart failure, arrhythmias, or premature or sudden cardiac death. Vitals demonstrated mild tachycardia to 105 beats per minute and a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, and labs revealed a negative troponin level. Ultimately, the ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) alert was cancelled due to the high clinical suspicion of the type 1 Brugada pattern in a syncopal patient with anteroseptal ST elevations without chest pain. Workup for the febrile episode revealed positive serology for influenza B. Oseltamivir was started and the patient completed 5 days of treatment. The patient was no longer febrile and his tachycardia had resolved, but he continued to show a persistent type 1 Brugada pattern on the ECG during the entire hospitalization course as seen below (Figure 2). The patient subsequently went for a transthoracic echocardiogram which demonstrated a normal left and right ventricular function and no structural abnormalities. He also underwent coronary angiography, which revealed nonobstructive coronary artery disease.Ultimately, the primary concern was to elucidate, whether the patient’s initial clinical presentation represented an episode of arrhythmogenic syncope induced by the underlying Brugada syndrome, as this would lead to a recommendation for implantation of a cardiac defibrillator. Electrophysiology service was consulted and felt that the mechanism of his fall was mechanical and not related to a true syncopal event. They recommended an outpatient follow-up for consideration of an event monitor or loop recorder.The differential diagnosis for BrS includes several conditions that can lead to Brugada-like ECG abnormalities including acute myocardial ischemia or infarction, various central and autonomic nervous system abnormalities, and viral and febrile states among others [3, 11]. Defective myocardial sodium channels reduce sodium inflow currents, thereby reducing the duration of normal action potentials [12]. Febrile states have been reported to unmask a Brugada-like ST segment elevation secondary to reduced sodium influx at a high temperature [13]. Acute myocardial infarction or ischemia in the right ventricular outflow tract produces a ST segment elevation mimicking the Brugada syndrome probably due to the depression of ICa-L and the activation of IKATP during ischemia [14]. Also, a sympathetic and parasympathetic tone imbalance may unmask the Brugada pattern on the ECG [15, 16] which may support our theory that autonomic nervous dysfunction is a possible culprit.Our patient has several different conditions that could cause him to have a ST segment elevation in V1 to V3. One of the first important ones is an acute coronary syndrome which was ruled out initially with negative serial troponin levels and definitively with a normal coronary angiogram. The patient was febrile, but he continued to have evidence of the type 1 Brugada pattern on the ECG despite improvement in his temperature and treatment for influenza. Patient’s history was somewhat unclear due to loss of consciousness from arrhythmogenic syncope. Consideration can be made for an electrophysiology study; if an arrhythmia was induced, ICD implantation would be a class IIB recommendation [2]. Had the patient consciousness been secondary to an arrhythmia in the setting of the Brugada pattern on the ECG, ICD would be a class IIA recommendation [2] (Figure 3. ICD in the Brugada syndrome algorithm). Thus, it is important to be able to distinguish arrhythmogenic causes of syncope from other causes, particularly in the setting of multiple sclerosis as management and prognosis of such a patient will highly depend on this determination.Although this patient’s fever and influenza had been resolved, the classic Brugada pattern on the ECG has not been resolved. In our review, the abnormality that could be linked to the stated ECG finding is the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system related to multiple sclerosis. Our patient did not yet have genetic testing for BruS and had no family history of sudden cardiac death. Additionally, our patient did not receive drugs with sodium channel blocking effects. In the setting of the asymptomatic Brugada syndrome, no ICD placement is recommended [17]. It is important to note that an AICD placement does not come free of risks and the patient was spared an unnecessary procedure.Further investigation is needed in cases where the diagnostic criteria of BruS fall short, especially in patients with a typical type 1 BrS but the mechanism of syncope is in question. In our case, the patient was advised to follow closely with the electrophysiology service. But there are other modalities who have shown to be useful in such cases. In one study, the intracardiac loop recorder has shown to contribute to the exclusion of ventricular arrhythmia as a mechanism of atypical syncope in patients with electrocardiographic evidence of the type 1 Brugada pattern [18]. Continuous cardiac monitoring assists in risk stratification in patients with suspected BruS and may help to inform the possible decision for ICD implantation.In summary, there is evidence that anatomical and/or functional abnormalities of the ANS can provoke ECG changes like BruS; however, the clinical significance for these patients needs further clarification. Due to the significant autonomic dysfunction that accompanies patients with multiple sclerosis, the formal diagnosis of the Brugada syndrome may prove more difficult. The prognostic significance of isolated BruS in multiple sclerosis patients remains a matter of considerable debate. In a patient like ours where the etiology of syncope is an unclear manifestation of BrS type 1, the ECG must be carefully investigated with a close follow-up, and more recently developed modalities of arrhythmia detection such as implantable loop recorders may prove to be useful towards confirming a diagnosis of the Brugada syndrome.The authors have confirmed that this article is unique and not under consideration or published in any other publications.We have no actual or potential conflict of interest in relation to this manuscript.MI and RC conceived and designed the experiments.

Right-Sided Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator System Implantation in a Patient with Complex Congenital Heart Disease and Dextrocardia: A Case Report and Literature Review
1Heart Centre, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia2Alfaisal University, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaCorrespondence should be addressed to Bandar Al-Ghamdi; as.ude.crhsfk@idmahglabReceived 13 October 2018; Revised 13 January 2019; Accepted 23 January 2019; Published 5 February 2019Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2019 Bandar Al-Ghamdi. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) and low left ventricular ejection fraction are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Prevention of SCD by subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) implantation may represent a valuable option in certain CHD patients. Patients with CHD and dextrocardia pose a challenge in S-ICD system implantation, and nonstandard device placement may be required. Furthermore, electrocardiogram (ECG) screening prior to S-ICD implantation in CHD patients has significant limitations. This case represents the placement of a S-ICD system on the right side of the chest in a 26-year-old male with severe biventricular failure and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia following multiple corrective surgeries of situs inversus totalis, double-outlet right ventricle with a ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary atresia. The use of S-ICDs in a CHD population and in particular CHD patients with dextrocardia and right-sided S-ICD implantation is briefly discussed.Patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) and low left ventricular ejection fraction are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) [1–3]. Prevention of SCD by subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) implantation may represent a valuable option in certain CHD patients. Patients with CHD and dextrocardia pose a challenge in S-ICD system implantation, and nonstandard device placement may be required.The placement of a S-ICD system on the right side of the chest in a patient with complex CHD with dextrocardia and advanced heart failure is presented here.The use of S-ICDs in a CHD population and in particular CHD patients with dextrocardia and right-sided S-ICD implantation is briefly discussed.The patient is a 26-year-old male with a history of situs inversus totalis, double-outlet right ventricle with a ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary atresia, a type of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). He underwent multiple corrective surgeries including biventricular repair in 1993 and tricuspid valve repair, residual ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure, and right ventricle (RV) to pulmonary artery (PA) homograft in 1997. Subsequently, he underwent a redo replacement of the pulmonary valve utilizing a cryopreserved pulmonary homograft with a size of 29 mm due to dysfunctional pulmonary homograft in 2010. A small residual ventricular septal defect with a restrictive left to right shunt (peak end -systolic gradient of 42 mmHg) and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with a peak gradient of 27 mmHg were noted in the echocardiogram. He had severe biventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection , Figure 1) with frequent heart failure admissions requiring intermittent inotropic support, and he was on the waiting list for heart transplantation.The right heart catheterization showed low resistance (pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) 1.3 Wood units (WU)), and shunt calculation showed a normal pulmonary flow (Qp) to systemic flow (Qs) ratio (Qp : Qs was 1 : 1). Both the inferior vena cava (IVC) and superior vena cava (SVC) were draining to the left-sided atrium. He also had intra-atrial reentry tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 117 beats per minute in 2012 and had external synchronized cardioversion once. He was considered for an electrophysiology study and ablation of the intra-atrial reentry tachycardia, but there was no significant change in his LVEF after cardioversion, and later on, he went into atrial fibrillation (AF) with a controlled ventricular rate. He was on anticoagulation with warfarin. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed AF and right bundle branch block with a QRS duration of 164 milliseconds (ms) (Figure 2). He had premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) up to 5 beats at 187 beats per minute documented in telemetry and 24-hour Holter monitoring (Figure 3).His other medical problems included acquired perforating dermatosis, folliculitis (hair follicle abscess), and bilateral lower limb varicose veins. His skin swab was positive for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).The case was discussed in the cardiology meeting, and it was felt that he has a high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. It was also decided that S-ICD would be the best option for him considering his anatomy with residual VSD and a high risk of infection due to folliculitis and positive MRSA which may put him at risk of infective endocarditis with a transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (TV-ICD). The S-ICD ECG screening showed only an alternate vector to be acceptable in the supine and sitting positions (Figure 4(a)).The risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure were all discussed with the patient including the risk of inappropriate ICD shocks. He agreed to the procedure, and informed consent was obtained.The patient underwent S-ICD implantation (Emblem S-ICD (model A209) and S-ICD electrode (lead) (model 3401), Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) on the right side of the chest in December 2016. The pulse generator was placed at the right midaxillary line between the 5th and 6th intercostal spaces, and the S-ICD electrode was placed on the right parasternal area utilizing the standard intermuscular three-incision technique. Careful attention was made to avoid sternal wire contact with the S-ICD electrode.The S-ICD analysis at the end of the procedure revealed acceptable three sensing factors (primary, secondary, and alternate) (Figure 4(b)). Defibrillation threshold testing was not performed due to the concern of severe biventricular dysfunction. There was no T-wave oversensing with a limited exercise test on the first-day post device implantation. The chest X-ray showed an acceptable lead and device position (Figure 5). The patient made a good recovery with no complication related to the procedure.During the follow-up period of 22 months, he had no sustained ventricular arrhythmia, and he did not have any appropriate or inappropriate ICD shocks.Implantation of a TV-ICD may be challenging or even impossible in patients with CHD due to complex cardiac and vascular anatomy. Furthermore, implantation of transvenous or epicardial systems in these patients is associated with short- and long-term risks. The incidence of venous occlusion, inappropriate shocks, and lead fractures is higher in CHD patients compared to non-CHD patients [4–6].S-ICD represents an attractive alternative to TV-ICD in CHD patients. However, there is limited data on the S-ICD use in these patients’ population. In the EFFORTLESS (Evaluation of Factors Affecting the Clinical Outcome and Cost-Effectiveness) registry, only thirty-three patients (7%) had CHD [7].The analysis of the CHD cohort in the pooled data from the IDE (investigational device exemption) study and the EFFORTLESS registry including 19 out of 865 patients, after exclusion of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or cardiac channelopathies (Brugada syndrome, arrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and long QT syndrome), shows that S-ICD is a safe option in CHD patients at risk of SCD [8]. It has similar complication rates for the CHD versus non-CHD groups (10.5 vs. 9.6% []) and similar rate of inappropriate shocks for both groups (10.5% vs. 10.9% []). Successful defibrillation testing at 80 J was comparable for the two groups (100% in CHD vs. 98.5% in non-CHD, ), but there was a significant difference found with threshold testing at 65 J with lower success in CHD patients (88.2% in CHD vs. 94.6% in non-CHD, ) [8]. In another study that looked at the long-term experience with S-ICD in teenagers (<20 years of age) and young adults (20 to 26 years of age), thirty-one patients were included: thirteen were teenagers, and eighteen were young adults with a comparison to an age-matched control group with TV-ICDs. However, only four patients with CHD were included in this study. Ventricular arrhythmias were adequately terminated in eight patients (25.8%), and oversensing was observed in five patients (16.1%), resulting in at least one inappropriate shock. Younger age was an independent predictor of inappropriate shocks in S-ICD (hazard ratio: 0.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.34 to 0.92; ) [9]. However, the rates of inappropriate shocks were comparable to those in patients with TV-ICDs [9].Our patient has only one acceptable sensing vector with manual ECG screening. An automated screening tool was not available at the time of device implantation. However, during implantation procedure, all sensing vectors were acceptable. Patients with CHD commonly have conduction system disease with prolonged QRS duration which is a predictor of failed screening [10]. However, there were no significant differences observed in S-ICD eligibility between complex CHD patients and controls in a study that evaluated ECG vector screening in thirty patients with CHD and ten control subjects [11]. The alternate and primary vectors were most suitable in the complex CHD patients (tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), transposition of great arteries (TGA), Fontan circulation, and single ventricle physiology (SVP)). Furthermore, no significant impact of the postural change was observed for S-ICD eligibility compared to morphologically normal heart patients [11].ECG screening may not be very accurate, and preprocedure screening with an external S-ICD to evaluate sensing at rest and during exercise in all three sensing vectors (algorithm-based screening) was shown in a small study to improve patients’ selection and reduce the number of false-positive and false-negative ECG screening of the standard screening method [12]. There is no study with algorithm-based screening in CHD patients.Effective implantation of S-ICD on the right side of the chest in patients with dextrocardia and CHD was described in two previous case reports [13, 14]. However, our patient has more advanced heart failure compared to the previously reported cases and on the heart transplant list, and we have about two years of follow-up with no problems. Table 1 summarizes the reported cases with right-sided S-ICD and comparison to the current patient. Patients with CHD may require bradycardia or cardiac resynchronization therapy pacing. The S-ICD system can be used in conjunction with a transvenous pacing system if bradycardia pacing is needed [14].Coordinating S-ICD with a leadless pacemaker is another novel approach that may convert arrhythmias with anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) instead of a shock and provide bradycardia pacing at the same time. An early animal study with this approach is encouraging. However, studies in humans are still awaited [15, 16].A S-ICD system is an attractive option for CHD patients with a risk of SCD and vascular access problems and intracardiac shunts at a high risk of device infection with a risk of bacteremia and infective endocarditis. In patients with dextrocardia, right-sided S-ICD implantation is feasible and effective.This work was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and its subsequent updates.

A Rare Case of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor with a Liver Metastasis Infiltrating the Inferior Vena Cava and Extending to the Right Atrium with an Early Recurrence after Surgical Extraction
Department of Cardiology, Dreifaltigkeits Hospital Lippstadt, Germany, Academic Teaching Hospital of Westfaelische Wilhelms University Muenster, GermanyCorrespondence should be addressed to Dimitrios Siamkouris; rg.oohay@siruokmaismijReceived 1 July 2018; Revised 20 December 2018; Accepted 8 January 2019; Published 5 February 2019Academic Editor: Ertugrul ErcanCopyright © 2019 Dimitrios Siamkouris et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. The major cause of GIST is the presence of an abnormal form of tyrosine protein kinase (KIT) protein also known as CD117, which causes uncontrollable growth of the gastrointestinal cells. Most studies report incidences between 10 and 15 cases of GISTs per million. Metastases to the liver and peritoneum are the most frequent. We report a case of advanced GIST with a liver metastasis infiltrating the inferior vena cava (IVC) and extending to the right atrium in the form of a large, floating, isolated intracardiac liver metastasis with diastolic prolapsing through the tricuspid valve. This is a very rare manifestation. One week after heart surgery and removal of a  tumor mass from the right atrium and the IVC, echocardiography depicted an early recurrence.A 51-year-old female patient was admitted about 4 years ago to the emergency room for nausea, vomiting, dizziness, melena, and syncope. The patient’s history indicated upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and immediate esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed an ulcerating tumor in the pyloric antrum with blood oozing, strongly suspected for a gastric GIST. Haemostasis was achieved after endoscopic injection of epinephrine and subsequent adequate blood transfusion due to haemorrhagic shock led to the stabilisation of the patient. The histological diagnosis was ulcerating epitheloid GIST (Figure 1). Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were strongly positive for CD117, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA), discovered on GIST-1 (DOG1), and Bcl-2. CD34 was not evident. The mitotic rate was 8/50 high-power fields (HPF), and the Ki67-index/proliferation rate was estimated at 5%. The molecular pathological examination showed duplication in exon 11 of the KIT gene. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed no lymph node, liver, or bone metastasis. The pT2 M0 R0 (TNM classification) staged tumor was operated successfully with an open 2/3 stomach resection with a Roux-en-Y anastomosis and jejunojejunostomy. The 3.5 cm tumor was completely excised with edges clear of infiltration and no tumor infiltration of the serosa. The postoperative course was very satisfactory with no sequelae, and no adjuvant imatinib therapy was administrated after multidisciplinary treatment planning. The patient could be discharged 3 weeks after admission with the recommendation for abdominal (CT) scan and EGD every 6 months for the next 5 years.15 months later and in the scope of the follow-up examination, the patient complained for discomfort and slight pain in the right upper abdomen. The abdominal ultrasonography revealed multiple liver metastases, and the EGD confirmed a recurrence of GIST in the anastomosis. The abdominal and chest CT scan (Figure 2) confirmed diffuse liver metastases and revealed an encircling wall architecture of the GIST around the hepatic hilum with a partial obstruction of the common bile duct and a shifting of the portal vein without signs of portal vein thrombosis. However, no icterus was present. The CT scan revealed furthermore a suspected large thrombus in the IVC and right atrium. There was no evidence of lymph node, bone, or lung metastasis. The transthoracic (TTE) and subsequent transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) disclosed the presence of a  large mass in the right atrium with diastolic prolapsing through the tricuspid valve, without any clear attachment to the atrial wall, with an inhomogeneous appearance, and without vacuolisation (Figure 3), along with a similar 1.1 cm large mass in the IVC (Figure 4) with a suspected but no clear continuation between these two masses even after free style image acquisition. The patient denied any angina or dyspnoea. Anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin showed no improvement within few days, ruling out a thrombus formation and suggesting intracardiac metastasis. Due to recurrent electrocardiogram (ECG) alternations in the precordial leads suggestive of intermittent lung embolism, the imminent right ventricular diastolic flow obstruction with a resulting obstructive form of a cardiogenic shock, and because of the young age of the patient and the potential good response to imatinib therapy, she was referred to a cardiothoracic clinic.The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed no obstructive coronary atherosclerotic plaque. Prior to surgery, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Figure 5) verified the cardiac findings of echocardiography but also clearly exhibited a propagation of a liver metastasis as a continuous mass to the IVC and right atrium with no adherence to the cardiac wall. Surgical resection of the tumor in the right atrium and IVC was performed using a minimally invasive anterior lateral access approach supplemented with video-assisted thoracoscopy. The  resected tumor with endothelial infiltration of the IVC, concomitant local thrombosis (Figure 6), and no endocardial and myocardial infiltration of the right atrium was histologically and immunohistologically identical to the prediagnosed GIST (Figure 7) and was a contiguous extension of a liver metastasis to the heart. The patient could recover from the operation and was treated with 400 mg imatinib daily. However, a week after surgery, transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 8) revealed a new mass in the right atrium indicative of early recurrence. The patient deteriorated over time due to a further progression of the GIST with icterus. The course was furthermore complicated by Staphylococcus aureus sepsis due to central venous catheter infection, and the patient finally died due to multiorgan failure.GISTs are rare, potentially aggressive forms of cancer that may develop anywhere in the GI tract [1]. Most studies report incidences between 10 and 15 cases of GISTs per million. Estimates suggest that the prevalence is over 10 times the incidence [2]. Surgical resection remains the aimed therapy of GIST. Complete resection of the tumor is the main predictor of the postoperative survival of the patient [1]. Despite successful surgical therapy, GISTs exhibit a high risk for metastatic relapse. The work of Hirota et al. and subsequently Heinrich et al. proved that most of the GISTs are caused by c-KIT somatic gain-of-function mutations followed by similar mutations in platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA) [3, 4]. The initiation of KIT-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy such as imatinib and its successors improved the survival of these patients [5, 6]. However, the benefit in recurrence-free survival appears to be related to tumor size, with the most marked improvement in patients who had a large tumor (≥10 cm) [6]. In our case, the multidisciplinary tumor board conference involving pathologists, radiologists, surgeons, and medical oncologists as well as gastroenterologists, based on the positive surgical and clinical course of the patient and the so far scientific evidence at the time of treatment of our patient, which was not conclusive for adjuvant imatinib therapy in patients with locoregional GISTs and R0 surgery (i.e., an excision whose margins are clear of tumour cells) with no expected major sequelae, saw no clear indication for an adjuvant imatinib therapy taking also the size of the tumor into consideration. Gastric tumors have a more favourable prognosis than the intestinal ones, and according to risk stratification based on location, size, and mitotic activity, this GIST carried an intermediate risk for recurrence in the absence of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy [7].Current consensus of the experts at that time was to recommend adjuvant imatinib for patients at high risk of relapse and not for those at low risk of relapse. But there was no consensus for patients at intermediate risk such as our patient [8, 9].Metastatic GISTs are however associated with poor survival. GISTs most frequently metastasize within the abdominal cavity, especially to the liver and peritoneum, with bone and lung metastases being uncommon sites [1, 10]. Very rare metastasis to the skeletal muscle, adrenal gland [11], brain [12], and testicles [13] is also reported.Cardiac metastasis after a traditional narrative review using PubMed is reported to our knowledge in only 3 cases so far: 2 cases of metastasis in the left ventricle [6] and one in the right atrium [11] which coincides with the localisation of our case. The initial recognition of the mass was always accidental in CT scan. The differentiation from a thrombus is difficult because intracardiac tumors appear in CT scan as a low-attenuation filling defect, similar to a thrombus [14]. In one report, the differentiation was established through positron emission tomography (PET). PET showed that the mass was metabolically active and a thrombus was by this means excluded. However, PET is certainly not always available and could require patient transportation which may not be possible as the patient may be unstable. In our case, failed improvement after anticoagulation, TEE, and cardiac MRI consolidated the suspected diagnosis of a GIST metastasis which was verified after surgery. In the 3 reported cases of cardiac metastasis so far, the masses diagnosed in the left ventricle and right atrium, respectively, appeared to be attached to the cardiac wall and were therefore consistent with metastatic GIST; however, there is neither histological evidence of GIST nor histological evidence of infiltration of the endocardium or myocardium as the patients underwent no surgical therapy due to very limited prognosis. In our patient, surgery was endorsed because of the high risk for an obstructive form of a cardiogenic shock which could lead to a sudden circulatory deterioration of the patient and because of the possibility for a good response to imatinib therapy. This is the only case reported with histological analysis of a suspected cardiac metastasis of GIST. In our case, because of the lack of endocardial and myocardial infiltration, there is no evidence of hematologous or lymphatic spread of the GIST to the heart in the form of a classic cardiac metastasis and the cardiac involvement of the GIST is due to a contiguous extension of a liver metastasis to the IVC and the right atrium.Additionally, of clinical interest is the appearance of a new smaller cardiac mass in the right atrium only one week after surgical resection of the tumor. This is the first report of surgical removal of a GIST from the heart, and it shows that early recurrence of cardiac tumors involving GIST after surgery is possible. This experience should be taken into consideration for similar future decisions questioning the meaningfulness of a surgery in advanced cases before implementing KIT-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (wait and see how the patient responds to KIT-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy before cardiac surgery).The incidence of cardiac metastases is reported in literature, which is highly variable, ranging from 2.3% to 18.3% [15]. This case in addition to the so far published cases of cardiac metastasis involving GIST underlines the importance of considering GIST as a possible cause of cardiac metastasis or cardiac deterioration, associated with a very unfavourable prognosis and a possible high recurrence after surgery. GIST patients should therefore routinely undergo TTE by the time of diagnosis and in follow-up examinations, and cardiac surgery should be considered as the last resort in the battle against metastasized GIST.Informed consent for publishing this case report has been obtained from the husband, the legal representative of the patient, as the patient has died.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.The authors would like to acknowledge Henning Warnecke MD, Ph.D. (Cardiothoracic Surgery, Schuechtermann Clinic, Bad Rothenfelde, Germany), and Frank Henschke MD, Ph.D. (Institute of Pathology, Driburger Str. 34, 33100 Paderborn, Germany).
ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) in a Patient with Moyamoya Disease
Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville, TN, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Jeffrey Johnson; ude.kcmtu@osnhojhjReceived 18 November 2018; Accepted 10 January 2019; Published 4 February 2019Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2019 James Livesay and Jeffrey Johnson. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Moyamoya disease is a rare condition that is primarily reported in Asian populations, characterized by stenoocclusive intracranial angiopathy with small, fragile, and multiple collateral vessel formation. Extracranial complications, mainly abnormalities within the renal vasculature, have been described; however, there are very few case reports of cardiovascular complications in patients with Moyamoya disease. We report a 26-year-old Caucasian female with known Moyamoya disease who presented with both typical and atypical chest pain, mimicking symptoms of a previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Approximately six months prior to the current hospital admission, she underwent coronary angiography requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with two drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery (RCA) for a critical stenosis. Despite medical management, our patient developed inferior lead ST-elevations leading to a repeat left heart catheterization which showed clinically significant stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch. Development of significant coronary artery stenosis in a short period of time demonstrates the clinical significance of minimal atherosclerosis in the setting of underlying fibrocellular thickening as seen in patients with Moyamoya disease. Clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of coronary involvement in addition to intracranial vascular complications in patients with Moyamoya disease and take appropriate measures to prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis in these arteries.Moyamoya disease is a rare condition, primarily reported in Japanese and other Asian populations, best described by stenoocclusive changes in the internal carotid arteries and developed collateral vasculature [1]. These patients typically present at a young age with intracranial features such as ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes, and the occurrence of extracranial vascular dysfunction is exceptionally rare [2]. Reports of extracranial dysfunction in a patient with Moyamoya disease have mostly involved the renal vasculature leading to chronic kidney disease, while coronary artery involvement is extremely uncommon. The pathology of Moyamoya disease involves fibrocellular thickening of the vessel wall, and in this patient population, even minimal atherosclerosis can rapidly lead to significant stenosis of the coronary arteries [2]. Our patient, with known Moyamoya disease, presented with recurrent chest pain and stenosis in several coronary arteries that was successfully treated with multiple drug-eluting stents.A 26-year-old Caucasian female with known Moyamoya disease presented with a chief complaint of right-sided chest pain and numbness radiating to her right arm mimicking symptoms of a previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.Six months prior, the patient underwent coronary angiography remarkable for a critical lesion of the right distal coronary artery (Figure 1). At that time, she underwent successful percutaneous intervention with two drug-eluting stents to the distal right coronary artery (Figure 2). She had multiple other comorbidities including coronary artery disease, restrictive cardiomyopathy, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease stage IV, anemia of chronic disease, recurrent pneumonia, immunoglobulin deficiency, osteoporosis, and history of cerebral vascular disease. In the months leading up to this admission, she suffered multiple noncardiac complications including symptomatic anemia, pneumonia with hemoptysis, and lower extremity ulcerations. She closely followed with hematology requiring Procrit for hemoglobin levels less than 7.0 g/dL with notable improvement in fatigue and weakness. She was also referred to dermatology for suspicious lower extremity lesions that were biopsied and felt to be autoimmune with intentions on starting IVIG.Upon this admission, her initial troponin was 0.12 ng/mL which continued to rise to a maximum of 0.79 ng/mL over the first 24 hours; however, no specific EKG changes were noted. Given her rising troponin, presenting symptoms, and recently diagnosed coronary artery disease, she was started on guideline-directed medical therapy for acute coronary syndrome including heparin and beta blockade with as needed nitroglycerin, which provided significant improvement in symptoms. Due to the initial resolution of symptoms with medical management and associated high-morbidity conditions, we deferred left heart catheterization. Other significant initial labs included a 62 mg/dL BUN, 4.52 mg/dL creatinine, 23.0 mEq/L anion gap, 9.4 g/dL hemoglobin, 29.6% hematocrit, 18.2 white blood cell count, and 394 platelet count. A bedside echocardiogram was preformed revealing a normal left ventricular size with moderately reduced function with an LVEF of 40-45% along with mild global hypokinesis.Over the subsequent 72 hours, she continued to have intermittent angina and her cardiac biomarkers began to climb, but serial EKGs did not display any signs of ST-segment changes. During this time, we obtained daily complete blood cell counts revealing a declining hemoglobin, and over time, a fall in her blood pressure was noted. Ultimately, we made a diagnosis of a type II non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, believed to be secondary to demand ischemia. Therefore, we began blood transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dL providing a resolution of anginal type symptoms.Despite continued medical management and improvement in her hemoglobin level, our patient again developed persistent recurrent angina. On hospital day nine, she developed angina not relieved by nitroglycerin, and a repeat EKG revealed inferior lead ST-elevations consistent with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She underwent left heart catheterization remarkable for 90% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch (Figure 3), which was revascularized with a third drug-eluting stent (Figure 4). Diagnostic catheterization also revealed new 40-50% restenosis of her previous distal RCA stent (Figure 5) and noncritical stenosis of the first diagonal branch (Figure 6).During this prolonged hospitalization, our patient suffered further complications including superficial femoral artery ischemia requiring intervention, acute on chronic renal failure, and sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Due to her worsening overall condition and multiple comorbidities, our patient elected to go home with hospice and ultimately passed away.Moyamoya disease is a rare disease that occurs in the Asian population, most often clinically manifested as an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke at a young age. Cases of coronary artery disease secondary to Moyamoya disease are exceedingly rare with one article noting only 12 documented cases [3].Choi and colleagues describe a patient with known Moyamoya disease that presented with recurrent chest pain aggravated by stress and relieved by nitroglycerin. This patient was diagnosed with variant angina after receiving two doses of ergonovine revealing 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD along with fibrous plaque occupying 33% of the coronary lumen [2]. A case reported by Komiyama and colleagues demonstrates a 56-year-old female that presented with angina with secondary to clinically significant LAD disease treated initially with balloon angioplasty followed by CABG several months later for restenosis [4].Fibrocellular thickening of the intima and proliferative smooth muscle cell growth are the primary causes of arterial occlusion in Moyamoya disease. Nam and colleagues performed a retrospective study and postulated that symptomatic coronary heart disease is most likely the result of small atherosclerosis due to underlying endothelial proliferation [1]. Another study used intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and virtual histology (VH) to evaluate a critical proximal LAD lesion in a 20-year-old Korean male with known Moyamoya disease. IVUS and VH revealed a homogenous, eccentric, echogenic intimal thickening composed of fibrous tissue with no mid or distal intimal thickening. Stenotic lesions seen in individuals with Moyamoya disease are distinctly different when compared to lesions seen in patients with CAD from atherosclerosis as there is minimal lipid pooling and no calcium deposition [5].Our patient’s coronary angiography showed several areas where the vessel resembles a string of beads, which is best seen in the distal OM branch and distal RCA (Figures 3, 4, and 5). The string of bead appearance has been previously described in other vessels such as the peripheral pulmonary, renal, and carotid arteries as a direct result of intimal thickening [6]. This distinct pattern helps clinicians distinguish CAD in Moyamoya disease from CAD in the setting of atherosclerosis using coronary angiography.A recent study, using genetic analysis, found an association with homozygosity for RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys and multiple extracranial vasculopathies. The p.Arg4810Lys variant, commonly found in the Eastern Asian population, is thought to cause the classic intracranial vasculopathy when in the heterozygous state. However, individuals that possess the homozygous variant seem to develop systemic vasculopathy and more severe symptoms [6]. The link between the RNF variant, p.Arg4810Lys, and Moyamoya disease has potential to be a screening tool for the risk of systemic disease and disease severity.To the best of our knowledge, there are no other documented cases of coronary artery disease in a Caucasian female with Moyamoya disease. In this case, we were able to carefully track our patient’s CAD progression from the time of her original NSTEMI, secondary to a critical RCA lesion, to her STEMI only six months later. Repeat coronary angiography revealed an unexpected critical lesion in a completely different vessel, the first distal obtuse marginal artery, along with mild RCA restenosis.Regarding our patient’s disease progression, she was originally diagnosed with Moyamoya disease at a young age after a typical presentation of a cerebral vascular accident requiring coiling by interventional radiology. Her disease continued to advance to include chronic renal failure, peripheral vascular disease, and finally coronary artery disease. As demonstrated from previous studies, even minimal atherosclerosis can lead to critical vascular lesions in a Moyamoya patient [1]. Therefore, we believe patients with the diagnosis of Moyamoya disease, especially with any extracranial features, should be counseled on their risk of heart disease. Clinicians following patients with Moyamoya disease should consider aggressive medical management to prevent plaque progression as minimal atherosclerosis can drastically increase this patient population’s morbidity and mortality.Extracranial vascular complications in patients with Moyamoya disease are rare but can have a significant impact on a patient’s overall morbidity and mortality. Our patient was initially diagnosed with Moyamoya disease after presenting with cerebral vasculature complications and went on to develop multiple extracranial complications ultimately leading to death. Clinicians should be aware of the cardiovascular complications seen in Moyamoya patients and assess for the potential benefit of aggressive medical management in preventing coronary plaque progression. It is crucial that these patients are counseled on their risk of ischemic heart disease and informed about the optimal timing for cardiovascular medical evaluation.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Hemodynamic Support Using Percutaneous Transfemoral Impella 5.0 and Impella RP for Refractory Cardiogenic Shock

Prior to the advent of percutaneous and more durable left ventricular support devices, prompt revascularization with the addition of vasopressors and inotropes were the standard of care in the management of this critical population. Recent published studies have shown that in addition to prompt revascularization, unloading of the left ventricle with the placement of the Impella percutaneous axillary flow pump can lead to improvement in mortality. Parameters such as the cardiac power output (CPO) and pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi), obtained through pulmonary artery catheterization, can help ascertain the productivity of right and left ventricular function. Utilization of these parameters can provide the information necessary to escalate support to the right ventricle with the insertion of an Impella RP or the left ventricle with the insertion of larger devices, which provide more forward flow. Herein, we present a case of AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock resulting in biventricular failure treated with the percutaneous insertion of an Impella RP and Impella 5.0 utilizing invasive markers of left and right ventricular function to guide the management and escalation of care.Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMI-CS) is associated with in-hospital mortality between 33% and 55% [1]. Rapid hemodynamic evaluation and left ventricular hemodynamic support using the Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) pumps (2.5, CP, and 5.0) improve outcomes in patients with AMI-CS [2]. However, even with the timely insertion of these devices, mortality in AMI-CS remains unacceptably high [1, 3]. We present a case of AMI-CS in which a patient underwent insertion of Impella CP and revascularization of the infarct-related artery, but remained in refractory shock and required the escalation of hemodynamic support utilizing the percutaneous insertion of Impella RP and Impella 5.0. Herein, clinical decision-making and technical challenges of this approach are outlined.A 61-year-old man presented with 2 days of progressively worsening chest pain. Blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. The 12-lead ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 110 bpm and new left bundle branch block. An echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%, without evidence of mechanical complications. Troponin was 11 ng/mL. In the emergency department, he developed worsening shock and pulmonary edema necessitating mechanical ventilation. He was urgently triaged to the catheterization laboratory.Femoral angiography revealed no evidence of atherosclerosis and femoral artery diameters of 9 mm. An Impella CP was inserted via the left femoral artery, and coronary angiography/intervention was performed via the right femoral artery. Coronary angiography revealed 70% stenosis of the distal left main coronary artery, chronic total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, 80% calcific stenosis of the left circumflex, and chronic total occlusion of the right coronary artery (Figure 1). Invasive hemodynamics revealed refractory cardiogenic shock and biventricular failure (Table 1). Right ventricular failure was presumed to be due to collateral insufficiency to the chronically occluded right coronary artery.Given marginal hemodynamics and the presence of right ventricular failure, an RP Impella was inserted via the right femoral vein. Despite adequate flow from the RP (4.7 L/m) and CP (3.5 L/m), hemodynamics only modestly improved (Table 2). Percutaneous revascularization of the culprit severe stenosis in the distal left main and proximal circumflex arteries was challenging but ultimately successful using rotational atherectomy and implantation of a 4.0 × 38 Promus Premiere (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) drug-eluting stent, guided by intravascular ultrasound.Despite biventricular Impella support using CP and RP catheters and successful revascularization, the patient had persistent cardiogenic shock. This manifested as a markedly reduced cardiac power output (CPO) (Table 2). It was elected to escalate left ventricular support using Impella 5.0. Given the large caliber of the femoral arteries and lack of calcification, percutaneous femoral insertion was performed.Anticipating limb ischemia with large bore sheath insertion, an ex vivo bypass circuit was deemed necessary. With ultrasound guidance, an antegrade 5-French sheath was inserted in the right superficial femoral artery. Next, the existing 6-French sheath in the right femoral artery was replaced with progressively larger sheaths to dilate the arteriotomy. Finally, a 23-French sheath (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) was inserted. Via the 23-French sheath, an Impella 5.0 was inserted into the left ventricle and the existing Impella CP was removed through the left femoral artery. Hemodynamics immediately improved (Table 2). Antegrade perfusion of the 14 F left femoral arterial sheath was not undertaken as the caliber of the femoral artery was adequate to accommodate a 4.6 mm sheath. The ex vivo bypass circuit was created by connecting the 14-French left femoral sheath (donor which originally housed the Impella CP) to the 5-French right femoral antegrade sheath (recipient) (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Both legs and feet were warm to touch with intact distal pulses.In the cardiac ICU, Impella 5.0 and RP support was maintained (Figure 3). Vasopressors were not required. On hospital day 2, the patient developed profound intravascular hemolysis, transient complete heart block, and pulseless electrical activity requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A repeat echocardiogram revealed small LV and RV cavity sizes. Taken together, the findings suggested that the high flow rate from the Impella 5.0 had caused suction of endocardial tissue, leading to hemolysis and increased vagotonia. This improved with volume resuscitation and blood transfusions with reduction in Impella flow rate. On hospital day 3, the Impella RP was explanted uneventfully. The Impella 5.0 was explanted in the OR. Surgical repair of the right common femoral artery was uneventful. Despite confirmation of antegrade flow beyond the femoral artery, fasciotomy of the anterior compartment of the right leg was performed because of elevated compartment pressure and clinical evidence of limb ischemia. There was evidence of hematoma and myonecrosis in the right thigh, which was treated with resection of the affected muscle. The patient slowly recovered and was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation on hospital day 30. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved to 40%. He was discharged home from rehabilitation on hospital day 60.Early identification of cardiogenic shock and rapid institution of left ventricular mechanical circulatory support prior to primary PCI result in favorable outcomes. The Detroit Cardiogenic Shock Initiative, in which patients with AMI and cardiogenic shock were supported with Impella prior to PCI so as to minimize the “door to unload time,” resulted in survival to device explant of 89% and survival to discharge of 84% [2]. This represents substantial improvement compared to the historic survival rate of 50% prior to the institution of such an algorithm. Unfortunately, some patients still have refractory shock despite early mechanical support and successful revascularization. The present case illustrates such a patient, who had refractory shock due to both profound LV failure and concomitant RV failure.Left ventricular dysfunction is the cause of shock in ~75% of patients with AMI-CS, with the LAD being the most common infarct-related artery in these cases [4, 5]. A retrospective analysis of the SHOCK Trial (Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock) demonstrated that cardiac power output (CPO, calculated as the product of mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output, divided by 451) is the most potent predictor of survival in AMI-CS [6]. Furthermore, Impella 2.5 (providing up to 2.5 liters per minute of forward flow) increases CPO to a greater degree than IABP, a device that has not been shown to improve survival in AMI-CS [7]. Therefore, we believe that CPO is a reasonable therapeutic target in AMI-CS, and measures to increase CPO to greater than 0.6 should be undertaken.Impella CP was designed to provide up to 4.0 liters per minute of forward flow, and is now the standard mechanical circulatory device at our institution for the treatment of AMI-CS. However, some patients have refractory shock despite early use of Impella CP and coronary revascularization. If the cause of refractory shock is LV failure, escalation of LV support should be considered. Options include (1) implantation of a durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD), (2) venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) with a left ventricular vent, or (3) use of a larger axial flow pump, such as Impella 5.0 [8–10]. Of course, escalation of care assumes that multiorgan failure and anoxic brain injury are not present (in which case, a frank discussion with family members about treatment goals and expectations and terminal weaning of support may be most appropriate).Impella 5.0 is designed to provide up to 5 liters per minute of forward flow. Full LV support provides complete unloading of the left ventricle, which improves coronary blood flow to the culprit and nonculprit territories [11, 12]. Additional forward flow improves blood pressure and CPO and lessens the requirement of vasopressor agents, which have been shown to worsen survival in AMI-CS [13]. Although the size of the catheter is 9 French, the inflow cage is 21 French. Accordingly, device insertion may not be straightforward, and it usually requires surgical cutdown with anastamosis of a graft conduit to the access artery. Alternatively, a sheathless percutaneous insertion can be performed in the femoral or axillary artery [14]. Transcaval insertion allows for the insertion of a large-bore introducer into the femoral vein, then passage through an iatrogenic fistula from the inferior vena cava into the aorta. When Impella support is no longer needed, the introducer sheath can be removed and the fistula occluded by the insertion of a nitinol occluder device [15]. In our case, the femoral arteries were felt to be large enough to accommodate a 23-French Abiomed sheath. This sheath was selected because it features a softer hemostatic valve to allow the passage of the bulky inflow cage of the Impella 5.0 without kinking the catheter shaft or damaging the internal catheter electronics. It is a peel-away sheath, but it was left in place since removal of the sheath would undoubtedly cause profuse bleeding given the mismatch between the sheath size (23 French) and the catheter size (9 French). Certainly, removal of the peel-away sheath could lead to hematoma formation and compartment syndrome. Ex vivo arterial bypass was needed since the large-bore sheath was flow occlusive to the right lower extremity. Techniques for creating the bypass circuit are described elsewhere [16, 17].Pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi, calculated as ; values < 0.9 suggest RVD) was shown to be a potent predictor of outcome in AMI-CS due to RV failure [18]. In a retrospective analysis of the SHOCK registry, 37% of the patients had hemodynamic evidence of RV dysfunction when presenting with cardiogenic shock. Additionally, in 33% of the patients with RV dysfunction, the infarct-related artery was the LAD [19]. Right ventricular failure in the setting of AWMI could be provoked by collateral insufficiency to a previously occluded right coronary artery, preexisting RV dysfunction from a noncardiac cause, or multivessel coronary occlusion. However, animal models also suggest abnormalities in signaling pathways, such as cell chemotaxis, regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, regulation of apoptosis, and regulation of cytoskeleton organization and cell adhesion in the right ventricle when there is ligation of the left anterior descending artery [20, 21]. Therefore, infarction in one myocardial territory may have additional deleterious effects remotely in distant cardiac tissue. Although the unloading of the left ventricle should reduce pulmonary artery pressure and decrease the work of the RV, there are several mechanisms which lead to a perturbation of RV function. Increased cardiac output from the LVAD increases venous return to the RV, potentially worsening the preexisting RV failure [22]. Excessive leftward shift of the intraventricular septum may also decrease septal contribution to RV contraction, leading to RVF [23, 24]. LV unloading from an LVAD typically reduces tricuspid regurgitation (TR) through decreased RV afterload [25]. In the setting of an incompetent valve, increased RV volume and tethering of valve leaflets to a leftward-shifted septum can intensify TR [25, 26].Impella RP is a 22-French axial flow pump mounted on an 11-French catheter that is inserted peripherally via the femoral vein and provides up to 4.4 L/min of flow from the inferior vena cava into the pulmonary artery (Figure 3). Results from the Recover Right study showed favorable hemodynamic profiles after insertion, manifested by an improvement in the cardiac index, decrease in central venous pressure, and improved survival at 30 days [27]. In patients who are primarily unloaded with a left-sided mechanical heart pump, a decrease in cardiac power output < 0.6 may suggest poor RV function, especially in cases where the pulmonary artery pulsatility index is <0.9. Several other mechanical circulatory support devices are commercially available for the management of biventricular failure. These include VA-ECMO, biventricular TandemHeart pumps, and various combinations of left-sided Impella and TandemHeart or VA-ECMO pumps [28]. TandemHeart requires a transeptal puncture, a 21 F venous cannula, and a 15-19 F arterial cannula, while VA-ECMO requires an LV “vent” in the form of an Impella to mitigate progressive LV failure due to excessive afterload [29–31].We present a case of biventricular failure complicating anterior wall AMI successfully treated with full hemodynamic support using Impella 5.0 and Impella RP. Refractory cardiogenic shock despite mechanical circulatory support in AMI is a challenging clinical scenario. Two potential mechanisms for refractory shock in this setting include concomitant RV failure and persistent LV pump failure. An understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and timely management of these hemodynamic conditions is likely to improve survival.This case was accepted for poster presentation and presented at TCT 2018 in San Diego, California.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Rothia dentocariosa Endocarditis in an Unsuspecting Host: A Case Report and Literature Review
Beaumont, 3601 W 13 Mile Road, Royal Oak, MI 48073, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Stacy Willner; gro.tnomuaeb@renlliw.ycatsReceived 30 June 2018; Accepted 17 January 2019; Published 23 January 2019Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2019 Stacy Willner et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Rothia dentocariosa, a gram-positive coccobacillus, is a commensal bacterium that is part of the oropharynx and respiratory tract. In the past, it was known to be a cause for periodontal disease, but in recent years, Rothia dentocariosa has been found to be the cause of several other infectious entities, of which endocarditis is the most predominant. We present the case of a healthy 62-year-old female who, after undergoing routine dental cleaning two months prior, developed subacute bacterial endocarditis of the mitral valve, with subsequent cerebral septic emboli causing an occipital hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident, all secondary to Rothia dentocariosa.Endocarditis is defined as inflammation of the endocardium, which consists of the inner lining of the heart and heart valves. Bacterial infection remains the most common etiology and is most commonly caused by staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus species. While a Rothia dentocariosa infection predominantly causes endocarditis, having endocarditis secondary to Rothia dentocariosa remains a rare entity, with few cases documented in medical literature. To this day, there remains no clear consensus on an optimal therapeutic regimen.A 62-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department in November of 2017 with complaints of arthralgias, most notably in her right knee, left shoulder, and bilateral thighs that made it difficult for her to ambulate. She was also admitted due to a headache that was triggered primarily by coughing. Vital signs on admission were as follows: a blood pressure of 202/90 mmHg, a heart rate of 137 bpm, a respiratory rate of 20, and a temperature of 36.6 Celsius. Physical exam revealed Janeway lesions. She was found to have a neutrophilic leukocytosis, with white blood cell count at 20.4 cells/mm3 and neutrophils at 17.4 bil/L. Troponin was elevated at 1.85; this was deemed to be noncardiac in nature as the patient’s pain was relieved with ibuprofen and her EKG showed no acute findings. ESR and CRP were elevated at 95 mm/hr and 24.8 mg/dL, respectively. A computed tomography of the brain showed a high-density mass in the right occipital lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema. The patient continued to deny any visual changes or symptoms other than what was discussed above. An ophthalmologist was consulted to perform a dilated fundus exam, which was positive for small intraretinal hemorrhages that were deemed to be secondary to the patient’s hypertension and less likely positive for Roth’s spots. There was no evidence of disc edema. A brain MRI with and without gadolinium showed multiple small punctate bilateral areas of acute or subacute infarctions indicative of embolic phenomenon. The hemorrhagic area in the right occipital lobe was again identified, with subtle surrounding enhancement; the differential diagnosis consisted of neoplasm, vascular malformation, or embolic infarction with hemorrhagic conversion. A transthoracic 2D echo was without vegetation, so a transesophageal echo was ordered, and vegetation was shown on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Two blood cultures from admission then came back positive for Rothia dentocariosa. Infectious disease was confirmed, and the patient’s current antibiotics, which consisted of vancomycin and ceftriaxone, were switched to penicillin G on a continuous pump. The patient remained largely asymptomatic during her admission and was deemed to be stable for discharge from the hospital after a nine-day stay with penicillin G via a continuous pump for a total of six weeks and was planned for a follow-up MRI in three weeks. The repeat MRI came back showing new subacute strokes. The patient was reported, again, to be asymptomatic but was directed to come straight to the emergency department. A repeat transesophageal echo was done and showed the known vegetation on the mitral valve with new vegetation seen on the PICC line and an abscess between the mitral and aortic valves extending into the ascending aorta. The patient then requested transfer to another institution for further evaluation. A repeat transesophageal echo was completed at this outside institution which showed small anterior and posterior mitral leaflet vegetation with no significant destruction and no abscess. A cardiac MRI was then performed which showed a focal delayed enhancement in the apical inferior and lateral wall, likely secondary to coronary arterial embolization. The patient went on to complete the full six weeks of penicillin therapy, remained asymptomatic, and refused a mitral valve replacement. Her follow-up was continued in the cardiology clinic.Georg and Brown first created the genus “Rothia” in 1967; it was to include members of the family Actinomycetaceae, which resemble both Nocardia and Actinomyces but differ in the physiology and cell wall constituents. The first reported case of endocarditis secondary to Rothia dentocariosa was reported in 1978. Prior to that, Rothia dentocariosa had a well-established role in the oral flora, with only two more well known cases of infectivity: the first being the case of a periappendiceal abscess in a 19-year-old female in 1975 and the second being the case of a pilonidal cyst in a 17-year-old female in early 1978 [1].To this day, Rothia dentocariosa is mostly recognized as a normal oral pathogen, with low pathogenicity. Infective endocarditis remains the most common manifestation of a Rothia dentocariosa infection. In 2002, Boudewijns et al. performed a review of all 20 cases of infective endocarditis secondary to Rothia dentocariosa. Of the 20 total cases, 18 had cardiac abnormalities, which predisposed them to endocarditis. The 2 cases without cardiac abnormalities had poor dental hygiene and/or extensive dental procedures, predisposing them to Rothia dentocariosa infections. 16 of the 20 patients were cured, with only 6 patients without any reported complications [2].In 2011, another literature review, along with a case report, was published by Shakoor et al. It cited only two new cases of endocarditis due to Rothia dentocariosa since the first literature review in 2002, along with five cases of bacteremia without endocarditis and two cases of sepsis. One of the newly published endocarditis cases was written in Spanish and therefore unavailable, while the other case was about a 55-year-old male with baseline mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation who had undergone a dental extraction prior to the onset of his endocarditis. The high rate of complications reported in the first literature review was mentioned, even though the mortality rate for Rothia dentocariosa endocarditis had since remained low [3].Since the abovementioned literature review in 2007, four new cases of infections due to Rothia spp. are found on a routine search in PubMed: one case of Rothia dentocariosa-associated peritonitis [4] and three cases of endocarditis, in which two were secondary to Rothia dentocariosa [5, 6] and one was secondary to Rothia aeria [7]. Of the two cases of endocarditis secondary to Rothia dentocariosa, one involved a 34-year-old male, an IV methamphetamine abuser [5], and the other a 58-year-old relatively healthy male [6]. In the case of the IV drug abuser, he originally presented with altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, a new diastolic murmur, and new left-sided hemiparesis. On computed tomography of the brain, the patient was found to have new ischemic changes in the right middle cerebral artery territory. A transesophageal echo was then performed, in which large vegetation was seen on the aortic valve. Valve tissue was sent out for culture and came back positive for Rothia dentocariosa. The patient was treated for two weeks with ceftriaxone after valve replacement and had complete neurologic resolution [5]. The second case involves a patient who was diagnosed with presumptive endocarditis secondary to a new murmur and nonspecific prodromal symptoms by his PCP. Transesophageal echo revealed moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation with a thickened and myxomatous mitral valve and a posterior flail leaflet, with no vegetation. The presence of Rothia dentocariosa in blood cultures was then confirmed, and the patient was sent home with penicillin G via a continuous pump. Two weeks after discharge, the patient woke up with complete loss of vision in his right eye. After evaluation, he was diagnosed with endogenous endophthalmitis, also secondary to Rothia dentocariosa. After full treatment, the patient returned to baseline with no residual deficits [6].Complications secondary to Rothia dentocariosa are common and include, but are not limited to, cerebellar hemorrhages [8], cerebral embolism [9], intracranial hemorrhages [10], vertebral osteomyelitis [11], aortic root abscess [12], abdominal aneurysm [13], perivalvular abscess [14], and brain abscess [15].The current treatment for Rothia dentocariosa endocarditis consists of a 4-6-week regimen of penicillin, with or without gentamicin, or monotherapy with ceftriaxone [5]. In 2014, Ramanan et al. published “Rothia Bacteremia: a 10-Year Experience at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.” 67 patients from 2002 to 2012 with blood cultures positive for Rothia spp. were studied and analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed on 21% of the isolates; all were susceptible to vancomycin and most were susceptible to beta-lactams; however, 4 were resistant to oxacillin. In the end, it was determined that more data is needed to develop a standard of care for treating Rothia spp. [16].In conclusion, the presented case was a healthy 62-year-old female, who, despite any known risk factors, developed endocarditis secondary to Rothia dentocariosa. She sustained numerous subacute strokes secondary to cerebral embolization, while remaining largely asymptomatic. She was successfully treated with penicillin G via a continuous pump for a total of weeks, with subsequent imaging showing almost complete recovery of the mitral valve. This case further proves that Rothia dentocariosa can cause endocarditis and should always be a consideration, even in the most unlikely hosts.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Polycythemia Vera Presenting as Cardiac Arrest: Novel Management Strategies

Davis et al.

In young adults, drug use and hypercoagulable states are common causes for ACS presentations. We report a case of a man in his early 30s who was diagnosed with polycythemia vera (PV) and had a cardiac arrest due to an anterolateral ST elevation myocardial infarction. We discuss his unique management and review the evidence on the management of arterial thromboembolism in PV patients.Acute coronary syndrome presentations in young adults are often unrelated to atherosclerosis and instead are commonly due to drug use (i.e., cocaine), underlying hypercoagulable states, and vascular abnormalities such as fibromuscular dysplasia. Additionally, myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera (PV) can lead to acute arterial thrombotic occlusions. Here, we present a case of a patient with PV, who had massive coronary artery thrombosis presenting with sudden cardiac arrest. Although there have been many similar case reports [1–6], none have described an ST elevation myocardial infarction with ventricular fibrillation arrest presentation nor the extent of arterial thrombosis observed in this patient and its unique management.A male in his early 30s had a witnessed cardiac arrest shortly after an emotionally stressful event. Bystander CPR was initiated immediately. When emergency medical services arrived, the presenting rhythm was ventricular fibrillation and 1 shock was delivered. He was intubated at the scene. Standard advanced cardiac life support was continued en route to the nearest emergency department. In total, four cycles of CPR, epinephrine, and defibrillation were given prior to the return of spontaneous circulation, obtained upon the patient’s arrival at a community hospital. We were urgently contacted by the community hospital because his initial ECG was consistent with left bundle branch block morphology but then progressed on serial ECGs with significant ST elevations noted in leads I, AVL, and V4-V6 and ST depressions in leads III and aVF. The patient was transferred emergently to our institution for emergency coronary angiography in the setting of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient’s past medical history is significant for a stroke at age 7 without any residual deficits and hypertension. He was recently diagnosed with polycythemia vera (Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) positive) and was prescribed enteric-coated ASA 81 mg daily and hydroxyurea. The patient had previously been undergoing regular phlebotomy at our institution but had not attended these appointments over the last two months. It was unclear whether he was taking any medications at the time of presentation. Initial bloodwork showed the following: hemoglobin 184 g/L, hemotocrit 0.59, platelet count 1072 × 109/L, leukocytes 38.8 × 109/L, creatinine 142 μmol/L, hsTroponin 506 ng/L (peak 67322 ng/L) and CK 980 U/L (peak 9013 U/L), pH 7.12, and lactate was 9 mmol/L.Upon arrival at our institution, he was in cardiogenic shock with a blood pressure (BP) of 95/80 mmHg and a heart rate (HR) of 110 bpm on 2.5 mcg/kg/min of intravenous (IV) dopamine, 1 mg/min IV amiodarone, 20 mcg/kg/min IV propofol, and intermittent IV boluses of 50 mg rocuronium. He also received 120 mg of IV furosemide. IV norepinephrine was initiated at 10 mcg/min, and dopamine was discontinued. His ECG showed an anterolateral STEMI (Figure 1). ECASA 160 mg and ticagrelor 180 mg were given to the patient via the NG tube, and 4000 units of IV heparin was administered. He was brought urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a normal right coronary artery with collaterals to the left circumflex artery (LCX), complete occlusion of his left anterior descending artery (LAD), and a long 90% lesion of the proximal LCX (Figures 2(a) and 2(b), Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). The left ventricular end diastolic pressure was 30 mmHg. As he was on a significant amount of vasoactive medications for hemodynamic support, we did not believe it was appropriate to administer intra-arterial nitroglycerin at this time, nor did we feel this would lead to any change in his clinical management, as there was clear thrombus in the LM, LAD, and LCX. His oxygen saturation was 95% on 100% FiO2, but his BP was 84/68 and HR 118 bpm, despite being on 15 mcg/min of IV norepinephrine. Based on the patient’s clinical status and angiographic findings, an 8 French 40 cc intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP, Arrow® International, Teleflex Medical, Athlone, Ireland) was inserted into the right femoral artery followed by the administration of additional 7,000 IU (patient’s weight was 110 kg and had already received 4000 units preprocedure) of intra-arterial heparin. We then proceeded with emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on the LAD and LCX. There was a significant amount of thrombus in the LAD and LCX (Figure 3, Supplementary Video 3); and thus, 6 passes with a 6 French Export Advance™ Aspiration Catheter (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN) were performed. Soon after thrombectomy was completed, the patient experienced recurrent thrombosis of the left coronary system. Repeat thrombectomy was performed; however, the thrombectomy catheter itself became clotted.To combat the extensive thrombus formation in the setting of PV, we performed intraprocedural phlebotomy. A total of 550 mL of blood was phlebotomized, and two boluses of intracoronary eptifibatide were given. Despite this fact, there was a significant amount of recurrent thrombus formation and a second dose of intra-arterial heparin at 100 IU/kg was given for a total of 21,000 IU of IV unfractionated heparin which was administered for the procedure. Although an ACT was not drawn during the case, at the end of the case, it was 250 seconds. Eventually, the de novo coronary thrombosis stopped, and complex bifurcation stenting of the LAD, left main artery, and LCX could be performed using 2 drug-eluting stents and a bifurcation minicrush technique (Figure 4, Supplementary Videos 4 and 5). Despite these efforts, he remained in cardiogenic shock (BP 101/57 mmHg, HR 107 bpm) while on significant hemodynamic support (IABP at 1 : 1 cycle, IV norepinephrine 20 mcg/min, IV vasopressin 0.04 units/min, and IV epinephrine 20 mcg/min). The advanced heart failure and cardiac surgical teams were consulted, and the decision was made to bring the patient directly to the operating room for an emergency left ventricular assist device (LVAD-CentriMag, Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA), which the teams felt to be more appropriate than an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit. Additionally, 1 g of hydroxyurea was given at the end of the procedure via an oral gastric tube following consultation with hematology for the acute treatment of PV.His postoperative course was complicated by left-sided weakness and radiologic evidence of a new stroke (right occipital parietal subacute infarct with hemorrhagic transformation along with multiple small subacute infarcts in the right frontal, left frontal, and left parietal occipital regions), pneumonia, and a slow wean from the LVAD-CentriMag. Postprocedure imaging demonstrated evidence of significant mitral regurgitation secondary to complete flail of the anterior mitral valve leaflet with chordal rupture, which may have occurred following the emergency insertion of the CentriMag device. The patient underwent an Alfieri stitch procedure on LVAD removal, to reduce the degree of mitral regurgitation from severe to moderate. The patient eventually made significant neurological recovery and was discharged from the hospital to an inpatient cardiac rehabilitation facility, 38 days after admission to our institution. His ejection fraction at discharge was 25-35% with moderate mitral regurgitation.After discharge, the patient had a single chamber ICD inserted due to the persistence of severe LV dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20-25% as well as moderate-to-severe RV dysfunction. The distal half of his LV, as well as the septum, was thinned and akinetic. Within 3 months after discharge, he was readmitted to the hospital with right-sided heart failure symptoms and weight gain. Investigations revealed portal vein thrombosis and right-sided heart failure as the causes. He has required multiple dose adjustments of his cardiac medications due to development of cardiorenal syndrome. At 1 year post MI, his ejection fraction remained <30% with anterior wall akinesis, aneurysmal apex, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. He continues to be followed by cardiology, a dedicated heart failure clinic, respirology, neurology, haematology, and nephrology.Polycythemia vera is a type of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm. The diagnosis is based on the World Health Organization criteria [7], requiring all three majors or the first major and 1 minor criterion (major criteria: (1)  g/L in men and >160 g/L in women or % in men and >48% in women or increased red cell mass, (2) hypercellular bone marrow with trilineage growth, and (3) presence of a JAK2 mutation; minor criteria: hypercellular bone marrow with trilineage growth, low serum erythropoietin levels, and endogenous erythroid colony formation). Clinical symptoms include pruritus, splenomegaly, vasomotor symptoms, and arterial and venous thrombosis. The JAK2 mutation is 95 to 100% sensitive in the diagnosis of PV. Our patient had both the major criteria at the time of diagnosis and has had evidence of arterial thromboembolism both on this current presentation (coronary and cerebrovascular) as well as when he was a child (cerebrovascular). We learned from the patient’s hematologist that he was noncompliant with therapy, despite being prescribed cytoreductive therapy (hydroxyurea). Hydroxyurea has been shown to significantly reduce recurrent thrombotic complications such as stroke and myocardial infarction [8]. The incidence of thrombotic complications in PV patients ranges from 13 to 60%. The presence of traditional cardiac risk factors further increases the risk of thrombosis, especially coronary artery thrombosis [9]. Our patient had hypertension and was an active smoker, satisfying the above criteria.In patients with PV, arterial thrombi form due to platelet activation, adhesion, and aggregation [10]. Proposed mechanisms of thrombogenesis are multifactorial but involve increased shear stress due to high hematocrit leading to vessel wall inflammation and closer contact of platelets to the endothelium leading to platelet activation. The use of intracoronary eptifibatide or abciximab inhibits platelet aggregation by reversibly blocking the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, decreasing fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet activation [11]. Intracoronary eptifibatide doses can be up to 1000 times that delivered intravenously and can disaggregate the thrombus itself [12]. In the case of our patient, initially, there was recurrent thrombosis and the use of intracoronary eptifibatide may have decreased further thrombus formation, allowing the visualization of the coronary anatomy and PCI to be performed. Previously, a meta-analysis comparing the use of intracoronary to intravenous abciximab demonstrated a mortality benefit of intracoronary abciximab in primary PCI patients, although more recent data suggest no difference in myocardial damage with intracoronary or intravenous GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors [13, 14]. The subsequent INFUSE-AMI trial showed that among early presenting anterior STEMI patients, infarct size is decreased with the use of intracoronary abciximab but not manual aspiration thrombectomy [11]. In our patient, high-dose heparin was used synergistically with eptifibatide to block the coagulation cascade and prevent further intracoronary thrombus formation. To our knowledge, no other case reports have reported double bolus IV unfractionated heparin during primary PCI when there is such extensive thrombus burden. Although our ACT was therapeutic, we believed that in this young male, the benefit of extra heparin outweighed the risk of a potential bleed, and without preventing further thrombus formation, he likely would have died intraprocedurally. As the heparin and eptifibatide took effect, de novo thrombus formation decreased and PCI to the LAD and the LCX was possible. We do not feel that the intraprocedural heparin contributed to the hemorrhagic conversion of his thrombotic stroke, as the procedure and stoke were separated by multiple days and the heparin would have already been cleared from his system. He still would have had to have some heparin on board due to the CentriMag, and this could have increased the risk of hemorrhagic conversion.In situations where the pathology is unclear, both IVUS and OCT can be helpful to determine pathology and possibly change management [15, 16]. It was clear that the LAD and LCX were occluded with thrombus, which is known to occur in patients with polycythemia vera without underlying atherosclerosis. As seen in the RCA injections, there was some collateral flow to the left system, although collaterals can form quite acutely and do not suggest chronic atherosclerotic disease in this patient [17]. Since this patient was hemodynamically unstable, the goal was to reestablish blood flow, irrespective of the underlying pathology; thus, no adjunctive imaging modalities were used. Furthermore, as we were unable to establish any significant flow down the coronary arteries until stent deployment, there would not have been enough opacification with contrast for OCT to be beneficial.Prior publications have reported intraprocedural phlebotomy to combat thrombus formation, although they were not known to us at the time [3]. There are no guidelines addressing the acute management of arterial thromboembolism in patients with PV, especially in those with extremis presentations like our patient. The decision for phlebotomy as well as NG hydroxyurea was made empirically by the treatment team to try all means possible to preserve cardiac function and life. Our goal was to acutely reduce the hematocrit to <45%. Indeed, a prior study of non-PV patients which stratified STEMI patients based on hematocrit levels (anemia with % for women and <39% for men, normal hematocrit, or erythrocytosis with % for women and >47% for men) showed that although the one-month mortality was highest in patients with anemia, the odds ratio for mortality in patients with erythrocytosis was 4.3 [18]. Furthermore, PV treatment guidelines suggest targeting a % in PV patients to prevent arterial thromboembolism through phlebotomy and the use of cytoreductive therapy such as hydroxyurea [19, 20]. Although we used these measures to treat his PV acutely, these measures were maintained throughout his subsequent hospital stay. It is unlikely that randomized controlled trials would be able to be conducted with a sufficient number of patients to determine the optimal treatment method for PV patients with massive arterial thromboembolism presenting in an extremis fashion as the patient in our case, and we are acknowledging there is no evidence to support our treatment method.The management of high intracoronary thrombus burden is difficult, and there are no guidelines regarding this management. Strategies to deal with high intracoronary thrombus burden include the use of adjunctive thrombectomy, intracoronary GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and/or intracoronary thrombolysis with PCI if immediate intervention is required, usually due to poor flow or an occluded vessel. But if there is TIMI 3 flow, another approach includes IV heparin and the use of IV GP IIb/IIla inhibitors to allow for clot dissolution and then PCI later. Although the most recent ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines [21] have decreased the use of mechanical thrombus aspiration to Class 2b, for selective use, we do believe our patient was appropriate for aspiration thrombectomy. The ESC STEMI guidelines, [22] also recommended against routine thrombus aspiration, do suggest that thrombus aspiration may be considered in patients with large residual thrombus after wire and balloon attempts to open the vessel (which our patient would fall under) [23]. Although we agree that thrombectomy should not be used in all situations, for this patient, both his LAD and LCX were completely occluded by thrombus and he was in cardiogenic shock. These patients were not included in most of the thrombectomy trials [11, 24], or the number of cardiogenic shock patients was not identified for subgroup analysis [25, 26].There are no large-scale trials that look at the use of intracoronary thrombolytics but only small single-centre trials that have shown positive results for thrombus dissolution after the use of thrombectomy and/or intracoronary GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. The DISSOLUTION trial [27], which included approximately 100 patients, with 50 in each arm, showed decreased thrombus burden but no measurable change in MACE. The same was the case for the even smaller ICE T TIMI 49 study, which had 10 patients in each arm and once again showed that there was a decrease in thrombus burden but was not powered for a difference in MACE. Both studies demonstrated safety of IC thrombolytics with minimal to no bleeding events. The dosage used was between 1/5 and 1/3 of the systemic dose. At this dosage, there were no significant bleeding events. In these two small studies and a few other case reports, there seemed to be successful establishment of TIMI 3 flow after other standard PCI techniques failed without significant morbidity or mortality. The best approach in this situation would be the use of a microcatheter to allow for directed thrombolytic injection and not injection through the guide catheter which would result in significant “spillage” and a more systemic effect.PV patients who undergo PCI are left with having a higher than normal risk of stent thrombosis, although the true risk is unknown, nor do any guidelines exist on the antiplatelet regimen that should be followed. Logically, using more potent P2Y12 inhibitors such as ticagrelor or prasugrel in combination with ASA would lead to a lower stent thrombosis risk than that of clopidogrel. No data exists on the use of anticoagulants in this scenario. Given the propensity for stent thrombosis in these patients, we agree that if the patient can be adequately treated without stent insertion, this would be preferable, but if unavoidable, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor/prasugrel, in addition to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy, would likely result in the least long-term morbidity/mortality and the lowest risk of stent thrombosis.Here, we presented a case of a young male with polycythemia vera who was noncompliant with treatment and who presented with sudden cardiac arrest due to massive and recurrent coronary thrombosis. Our unique treatment included a multipronged approach employing thrombectomy, acute phlebotomy, double-bolus intracoronary eptifibatide, and double-dose IV unfractionated heparin, allowing thrombus removal and prevention of recurrent coronary thrombosis. The patient eventually required temporary LVAD placement until his cardiac status improved and he made a relatively complete neurological recovery over 5 weeks from his initial presentation. This case highlights the importance of maintenance therapy among patients with polycythemia vera and the extremis presentation they can have with arterial thrombosis.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Supplementary 1.

Delayed Diagnosis of Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction in a Young Patient with Multivessel Disease and Familial Hypercholesterolemia Complicated by Cardiogenic Shock Finally Treated with Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump as a Bridge to Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation
12nd Department of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Interventions, University Hospital, Krakow, Poland21st Department of Cardiology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland3Department of Interventional Cardiology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, PolandCorrespondence should be addressed to Rafał Januszek; lp.airetni@farnaajReceived 29 October 2018; Accepted 9 January 2019; Published 17 January 2019Academic Editor: Markus FerrariCopyright © 2019 Rafał Januszek et al.

Familial history of premature coronary atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia could help in proper diagnosis and treatment. We present a case of a 29-year-old female admitted to the catheterization laboratory with cardiogenic shock and multivessel coronary artery disease treated successfully with multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation as a bridge to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the most common causes of premature coronary atherosclerosis and, in consequence, major cardiovascular events but still very often remains unrecognized early enough and therefore is not treated properly. The risk of coronary heart disease in patients with FH is estimated to be increased at least 10-fold [1]. Based on the presented case of a young woman being treated at our department due to acute myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS), we would like to draw attention to several recently discussed problems in cardiology: firstly, severe cardiovascular complications due to undiagnosed FH at a young age; secondly, the cardiac diagnostic process of patients after sudden cardiac arrest; thirdly, the issue of noninfarct related artery (IRA) revascularization in acute MI; and finally, the role of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) in CS as a bridge to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).A 29-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department (ED) after sudden cardiac arrest at home followed by effective resuscitation. The first recorded heart rhythm was ventricular fibrillation. After effective resuscitation, due to respiratory insufficiency, the patient was intubated and mechanical ventilation was set. Electrocardiography revealed ST-segment depressions up to 1 mm in I, aVL, II, III, and V1-4 leads. The patient was then transported to the ED. At admission to the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable and preserved systolic blood pressure without inotropes. Considering blood tests, including elevated level of serum D-dimers, at first, computed tomography of the head and chest in pulmonary embolism algorithm was performed. There were signs of cerebral stroke and evident pulmonary embolism. Chest radiograph depicted features of pulmonary edema. At that time, a cardiological consultation was made on the basis of which the cardiac echocardiography was ordered at patient’s bedside. Cardiologist consultation and echocardiography revealed impaired left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) (approx. 25-30%) with regional contractility impairment (recent akinesis of the lateral, inferior, and posterior walls and hypokinesis of other walls) and moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient was immediately qualified for coronary artery angiography and transferred from ED to the catheterization laboratory (CathLab). During transportation to the CathLab, the first symptoms of CS had developed, and the patient was given first inotrope—noradrenaline. Coronary artery angiography revealed multivessel disease including recessive right coronary artery with 60% stenosis; the left main coronary artery was without significant stenoses, ostial occlusion of the dominant circumflex branch (Cx), left anterior descendent artery (LAD) with multiple significant stenoses: ostial: 80-90%, proximal segment: 70%, medial segment: 80%, and distal segment: 60%, the intermediate branch with 80-90% ostial stenosis. This is presented in Figures 1(a) and 1(b). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within Cx with thrombectomy and drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, Onyx , 18 atm., was performed and followed by sequential inflation in the intermediate branch (c.b. , 20 atm.) and Cx (, 24 atm.). Due to the progression of CS and no improvement after adding other inotropes (dopamine, dobutamine) at high doses, the decision was made to implant IABP and perform PCI of LAD. Predilation with b.c.  20 atm. was performed. Implantation of two DES in the proximal and medial segment was performed: DES Ultimaster (, 18 atm.) and DES Create (, 16 atm.). Postdilatation, with b.c. , up to 20 atm., was executed using the proximal optimization technique. Then, the patient was then sent to the intensive care cardiology unit in a critical state, with the blood pressure of 40-50 mmHg. Control echocardiography revealed decreased LVEF (around 20%). A fourth inotrope was added (adrenaline) without significant improvement of systolic blood pressure. After consultation at the cardiac surgery department, the patient was qualified for ECMO treatment. The patient was successfully surgically connected to ECMO after transportation to the cardiac surgery unit and surgeons were able to wean from the ECMO, due to the improvement of LVEF after five days. During the long stay at the cardiac surgery unit, several complications developed, including severe bleeding demanding transfusion of more than 16 units of blood products, acute ischemia of the left lower limb, left femoral artery thrombectomy and surgical angioplasty, respiratory tract infections with negative culture (bronchoscopy), pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and recurrent mechanical ventilation necessity. The patient finally survived, was weaned from mechanical ventilation, and was discharged for further rehabilitation after almost 70 days without any neurological deficiencies and able to walk using a walker.According to the lack of any previous diagnostic results indicating FH, making the diagnosis at admission was difficult. Correctly collected interviews by rescuers during resuscitation of the patient at her home could shorten the time of transportation to CathLab. The patient’s sister’s MI performed at a young age and her father’s death as a complication of acute MI indicated suspicion of an inherited issue in our patient. All patients following the return of spontaneous circulation who do not have an alternate explanation for cardiac arrest irrespective of the electrocardiography findings may be considered for coronary angiography and possible PCI [2]. It has been demonstrated that direct transport to CathLab was associated with a significant increase in survival rate [3]. Also, the bedside echocardiography should be performed immediately if there is suspicion of underlying cardiac ischemia [4]. Delayed time of reperfusion in MI patients is especially important because it has great impact on mortality rate [5]. In the current case, there was an immediate worsening of clinical state after PCI of IRA at the CathLab. Then, the IABP was inserted and a decision was made to perform non-IRA PCI. The PCI of the IRA and complete revascularization approach were compared in four randomized clinical trials: PRAMI, CvLPRIT, DANAMI-3–PRIMULTI, and Compare-Acute trial. None of them has demonstrated superiority of complete revascularization in mortality reducing to primary PCI of the IRA [6–9]. Another option of left ventricle support device for that patient could be the Impella heart pump. However, first, we did not have this device in CathLab at that time, and secondly, the device is preferred in stable patients with low LVEF undergoing PCIs, although it is also successfully used in acute conditions. Therefore, according to the ESC 2017 consensus, non-IRA PCI during the index procedure is rather not advised in patients with CS [10]. However, in this particular case, we decided to perform PCI of non-IRA due to the young age of the patient. Cardiogenic shock is the main cause of death related to acute MI, with a mortality rate of 40-50% in the absence of aggressive and highly specialized technical care [11–13]. Until 2012, the European and American consensus considered the use of IABP; in the case of post-AMI, cardiogenic shock was rather recommended. Based on the results of recent meta-analyses, the current consensus has changed its recommendations, and now, IABP should be considered in acute MI-related CS and mechanical complications instead of short-term percutaneous mechanical support which is preferred in these patients [3, 14]. Currently, the European consensus does not advocate for the routine usage of IABP due to the results of the large randomized multicenter IABP-SHOCK II trial which showed no survival benefit with IABP support. At 30 days, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of mortality between IABP and control groups [15]. However, future longer follow-up could modify this approach. On the other hand, the specific use of IABP as a bridge to ECMO in CS has not been closely evaluated. Such a solution may bring special benefits at centers without a cardiac surgery department, without regular access to short-term left ventricle support devices. In this case, additional hemodynamic support is necessary to secure the patient during the time of transportation. In this specific situation, the lack of IABP affects the time for hemodynamic stabilization, length of stay at the ICU, the dose and duration of catecholamine therapy, and renal function. Our main purpose was to maintain the minimal critical organ blood supply and oxygenation until transportation to the cardiac surgery center and then connect the patient to ECMO. It should be noticed that despite the persistent extremely low systolic blood pressure and delay associated with the necessity of organization and transportation to another center, our patient does not have any permanent neurological deficiencies.In conclusion, IABP could serve as bridge therapy to ECMO in young and promising patients with acute MI in the course of multivessel disease complicated by CS. Nationwide screening programs for familial hypercholesterolemia should be conducted to detect patients with FH at the youngest possible age and treat them properly. Young patients after sudden cardiac arrest, and in particular with innate risk factors for premature atherosclerosis, should be first consulted at CathLab to implement the appropriate diagnostic and treatment procedures, which could affect the overall hospital stay length and condition of the patient. Selected patients with cardiogenic shock may benefit from PCI of non-IRA.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Cold at the Core: Osborn Waves in Neurosarcoidosis-Induced Central Hypothermia
1Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA2Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Morristown Medical Center, Atlantic Medical Group, Morristown, NJ, USA3Department of Medicine, Division of Sleep Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, New Brunswick, NJ, USA4Department of Medicine, Division of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Gregory Scott Troutman; ude.nosreffej@200tsgReceived 13 August 2018; Accepted 30 November 2018; Published 15 January 2019Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2019 Gregory Scott Troutman et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Osborn waves, or J waves, initially described by John Osborn in 1953 in hypothermic dog experiments, are highly sensitive and specific for hypothermia. Initially thought to be secondary to a hypothermia-induced “injury current,” they have more recently been attributed to a voltage differential between epicardial and endocardial potassium (Ito) currents. While the exact conditions required to induce such waves have been debated, numerous clinical scenarios of environmental and iatrogenic hypothermia have been described. Below, we report a novel case of hypothermia—that of neurosarcoidosis-induced central hypothermia with resultant Osborn waves and other associated findings found on electrocardiogram (ECG).Osborn waves, or J waves, initially attributed to a hypothermia-induced “injury current,” have more recently been attributed to a differential between epicardial and endocardial potassium (Ito) currents creating a voltage gradient and the observed J wave [1, 2]. While not pathognomonic for hypothermia, the presence of J waves, most commonly seen in the anterior and lateral precordial leads, is highly sensitive and specific for hypothermia [3, 4].Neurosarcoidosis is a relatively uncommon, often debilitating condition affecting approximately 5% of patients with sarcoidosis. Pituitary disease can cause thyroid, gonadal, and adrenal abnormalities or panhypopituitarism. Hypothalamic involvement can further result in central diabetes insipidus and dysthermia (either hypothermia or hyperthermia). Management often involves systemic corticosteroids and the replacement of all deficient hormones to correct the endocrine dysfunction [5].Below, we describe the case of a patient with neurosarcoidosis who presented with hypothermia and prominent Osborn waves on electrocardiogram (ECG) in the setting of significant pituitary and hypothalamic dysfunction.A 40-year-old African-American male with neurosarcoidosis involving the hypothalamus and pituitary (Figure 1) presented to an urban academic medical center with altered mental status. On arrival, the patient was lethargic but responsive to verbal stimuli and the physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. The patient was noted to be hypothermic (32°C) and hypernatremic (176 mEq/L). Admission ECG revealed sinus bradycardia at 41 beats per minute, first-degree AV block (PR interval 280 ms), premature atrial contractions, prolonged QRS (160 ms) and QT (QTc 584 ms) intervals, and Osborn waves most prominent in the precordial lateral leads (Figure 2(a)).The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit where careful intravenous fluid management and administration of intranasal desmopressin were initiated. After 24 hours, with the improvement of his serum sodium, the patient’s mental status improved. The patient was warmed via external warming blankets, with resolution of the above electrocardiographic findings (Figure 2(b)). The remainder of the patient’s treatment included corticosteroids, testosterone, levothyroxine, and desmopressin, and he was discharged home ten days after presentation.Neurosarcoidosis is a debilitating condition that affects a minority of patients (~5%) with sarcoidosis. As a systemic granulomatous disease, sarcoidosis can affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems with the neurological manifestations varying depending on the areas of disease involvement [6, 7]. Pituitary disease and hypothalamic involvement can result in severe endocrine dysfunction including panhypopituitarism and central diabetes insipidus and dysthermia (either hypothermia or hyperthermia), respectively, as were seen in this patient [4–7].Osborn waves, or J waves, initially described as a hypothermia-induced “injury current,” have more recently been attributed to a differential between epicardial and endocardial potassium (Ito) currents creating a voltage gradient and the observed J wave [1, 2]. Though not necessarily pathognomonic for hypothermia, the presence of J waves is highly sensitive and specific for hypothermia. Most commonly seen in the anterior and lateral precordial leads is the amplitude of the J wave which is inversely proportional to the degree of hypothermia and is present in 80% of individuals with a temperature below 35°C. Other electrocardiographic findings include PR, QRS, and QT prolongation, as in this patient, as well as supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in more severe hypothermia [3].Since its original description, it has been suggested that hypothermia must be accompanied by some other disturbance (i.e., acidosis) to result in the development of the Osborn wave [1, 3]. Subsequent reports, however, have suggested a hypothalamic or neurogenic cause for the J waves as seen in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage [3, 8]. Experimental animal experiments inducing subarachnoid hemorrhage have confirmed similar ECG findings to that of hypothermia suggesting a possible relationship between hypothalamic dysfunction and autonomic catecholamine imbalance with a resultant disorder of myocardial rhythm and function [9, 10].Thus, our patient represents an unusual cause of hypothermia with classic findings on ECG. These findings, unlike prior reports, may represent effects of both systemic hypothermia and hypothalamic dysfunction. To our knowledge, this is the first report of neurosarcoidosis-induced hypothermia with associated Osborn waves along with other associated ECG changes, all of which resolved with warming, steroid and hormone replacement, and supportive care.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
The Full Spectrum of Infective Endocarditis: Case Report and Review
1Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA2Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Jayant Nath; ude.cmuk@htanjReceived 13 August 2018; Revised 27 October 2018; Accepted 10 December 2018; Published 10 January 2019Academic Editor: Kathleen NguCopyright © 2019 Aniket S. Rali et al.

Classically, IVDU has been thought to affect right-sided valves. However, in recent times a more variable presentation of IVDU-associated IE has been reported. Here, we report a case of a patient with a known history of IVDU who presented with clinical symptoms concerning for right- as well as left-sided endocarditis. In addition, we also discuss what should be considered adequate evaluation for patients with suspected endocarditis, and more specifically, what should be the role of transesophageal echocardiography in patients with IE noted on transthoracic echocardiography.Extended intravenous drug use (IVDU) is a known risk factor for infective endocarditis (IE) [1]. Over the last five decades, the incidence of IE-related hospitalizations in North America has continued to increase with increasing IVDU. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative microorganism [2, 3]. Classically, IVDU has been thought to be the main cause of right-sided valvular IE. However, the incidence of specific valvular site involvement in patients with a history of IVDU is reported to be variable [3, 4]. A prospective, randomized clinical trial noted a higher incidence of right-sided lesions with IVDU. Two out of twenty patients had bilateral involvement [5]. In a sample population of patients with a history of IVDU who suffered death from IE, 16% were noted to have bilateral vegetations [6]. Another retrospective cohort study showed that left-sided lesions were more common than right-sided ones and that concurrent involvement was rare [7]. Older studies reported equal frequencies of right- and left-sided lesions [8].Here, we report a case of a patient with a known history of IVDU who presented with clinical symptoms concerning for right- as well as left-sided endocarditis.A 56-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of altered mental status and weakness. His past medical history was significant for long-standing IVDU, chronic purulent cellulitis of bilateral lower extremities, osteomyelitis of bilateral tibiae, latent tuberculosis treated eleven years prior to presentation, and previously treated hepatitis C infection. The current hospitalization was his second within eight months, as he was previously hospitalized for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia due to cellulitis and osteomyelitis attributed to extensive ongoing intravenous drug injections through lower extremity veins. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed during that hospitalization was negative for endocarditis.During the current admission, the patient’s Glasgow coma scale was 13 on presentation. Physical examination was limited by the patient’s inability to cooperate, but the patient was noted to have left lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, bilateral lower extremity and right upper extremity wounds, and a large tender sacrocoxal erythematous ulcerated lesion. Presenting vital signs included a blood pressure of 140/79 mm Hg, temperature of 36.4 Celsius, heart rate of 114 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 3 liters of supplemental oxygen. Laboratory studies were concerning for leukocytosis of 25.6 K/μL (4.5–11.0 K/μL), hemoglobin of 5.7 gm/dL (13.5–16.5 gm/dL), and platelet count of 129 K/μL (150–400 K/μL). Iron studies were suggestive of anemia of chronic inflammation. Other laboratory abnormalities included serum creatinine of 1.25 mg/dL (0.4–1.24 mg/dL), serum sodium of 127 mmol/L (137–147 mmol/L), and albumin of 2.0 g/dL (3.5–5.0 g/dL). Creatine kinase was 1288 U/L (35–232 U/L), lactic acid was 3.1 mmol/L (0.5–2.0 mmol/L), and troponin was 0.18 ng/mL (0–0.05 ng/mL). Blood as well as urine cultures were positive for MSSA. Furthermore, urine drug screening returned positive for cocaine and opioids. Soon after presentation, the patient developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure, hemodynamic shock, and worsening encephalopathy. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for pressor support and mechanical ventilation.Pan-computed tomography (CT) scans revealed bilateral multiple pulmonary nodular opacities, some of which were cavitary in nature concerning for multifocal pneumonia, acute hematomas in the abdominal wall musculature, and multiple subacute to chronic left cerebellar and left occipital infarcts, all concerning for septic emboli. These brain lesions were confirmed on subsequent brain MRI. Cultures from the bronchoalveolar lavage were positive for MSSA, negative fungal culture, and acid-fast stain. Further laboratory testing showed negative results in a fourth generation HIV1/2 immunoassay and in T-spot tuberculosis screening.A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a 0.5 cm mobile mass, consistent with vegetation, in the atrial aspect of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve without any valvular dysfunction (Figure 1(a)). Although the other valves were not well visualized on this study, the patient’s left ventricular ejection function was noted to be normal. Given concerns for left-sided endocarditis, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was pursued. TEE showed vegetations on the tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valves, as well as in the right ventricular outflow tract. The tricuspid valve had a  vegetation on the anterior leaflet and a  vegetation on the septal leaflet. The mitral valve had a  vegetation on the P3 segment. There was also a 0.8 cm vegetation on the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve with only mild aortic insufficiency. The pulmonic valve itself was without vegetations, but there was a 1.1 × 1.1 cm vegetation in the right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT) (Figure 1(b–d)).The patient continued to receive medical care in the MICU for 2 weeks with a progressive decline in his condition. The patient was deemed to be a poor unstable surgical candidate by the cardiothoracic surgery team, and hence, the patient was transitioned to comfort care measures only after detailed discussions with the family. The patient passed away shortly thereafter from multiorgan failure. An autopsy was declined by the family.Our report discusses a rather unusual presentation of infective endocarditis and hence leads into the discussion of an adequate work-up for suspected endocarditis. The American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ECS) both recommend TTE as the modality of choice for the initial evaluation of suspected IE [9, 10]. TTE is a noninvasive diagnostic modality with a reported sensitivity ranging between 44 and 70% for the detection of native valve vegetation and a sensitivity of 50% for the detection of abscesses [11, 12]. The ease of this test makes it the obvious choice for initial evaluation. However, the question begets if further evaluation is recommended if IE is already confirmed on initial TTE.In our case, multiple bilateral vegetations leading to pulmonic and systemic septic emboli were noted on TEE, only one of which was diagnosed on initial TTE. Those bilateral vegetations ultimately guided the patient’s goals of care discussion. TEE is well known to have much greater sensitivity for the detection of infective endocarditis. TEE has greater than 90% sensitivity for native valve vegetation and 90% sensitivity for paravalvular abscess. Specificity on both modalities is similar and is greater than 90% [11, 12].To the best of our knowledge, only five previous cases have been reported where patients with IVDU had bilateral cardiac IE. All of the patients had positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [13–16], except one who had negative blood cultures but vegetations with gram positive cocci on autopsy [17]. Among these cases, left-sided manifestations included paravalvular abscess with aortico-left atrial fistula [13], isolated mitral valve vegetations [14], aortic and mitral valve vegetations [15], extension of tricuspid vegetation through patent foramen ovale [16], and vegetation in the left ventricular outflow tract and mitral valve found on autopsy [17]. Only one prior case had more than two concurrent bilateral vegetations such as ours, with vegetations on pulmonic, tricuspid, and aortic valves with a perforation of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve [15].In conclusion, patients with a history of IVDU are at an increased risk for IE that could be right-sided, left-sided, or bilateral. Even though a TEE is logistically harder to obtain in the acute setting, physicians should generally be encouraged to obtain it early in the clinical course to allow for a more thorough evaluation. As was the case with our patient, this additional information can be pivotal in recommending the appropriate plan for care for patients.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.Aniket S.

Frequently Recurrent Takotsubo Syndrome in COPD
1Department of Medicine, Halmstad Hospital, Halmstad, Sweden2Department of Cardiology, Halmstad Hospital, Halmstad, Sweden3Krefting Research Centre, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, SwedenCorrespondence should be addressed to Juan Vaz; es.dnallahnoiger@sadinoelzav.naujReceived 21 August 2018; Revised 4 December 2018; Accepted 6 December 2018; Published 9 January 2019Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2019 Juan Vaz et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Cardiovascular disease is common among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a transient cardiac disorder that, in its typical form, involves left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning and mimics acute coronary syndrome (ACS). “Bronchogenic TTS” has been proposed as a specific form of TTS (during severe acute dyspnea in asthma or COPD) with atypical presentation. Recurrent TTS in COPD seems to be exceptionally rare since only a handful of clinical cases have previously been reported in the literature. Here, we present a unique case of a frequently recurrent TTS during COPD exacerbation in a 70-year-old woman, with at least 4 different episodes of TTS within 5 years. This case report exemplifies the difficulties of the diagnosis of TTS at the onset of acute COPD exacerbation. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic strategies are also briefly discussed.Cardiovascular disease is common among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). More than 3.2 million COPD patients die annually, and in approximately 30% of the cases, cardiovascular disease and its complications are the main causes of death [1, 2]. Despite formerly being referred to as “stress cardiomyopathy,” Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a complex transient cardiac disorder that, in its typical form, involves left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning, and mimics acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [3, 4]. The prevalence of TTS is unknown, but it is estimated to be 2-3% of all patients with diagnosed ACS [5]. Cumulative incidence of recurrence in TTS has been reported to be approximately 5% at 6 years, and the annual rate of recurrence is only 1-2% [3, 6]. TTS has also been related to severe dyspnea during respiratory disease [7, 8], but the pathophysiological mechanisms remain mostly unknown [9]. “Bronchogenic TTS” has been proposed as a specific form of TTS that occurs during severe acute dyspnea in asthma or COPD, with atypical presentation [10–12]. Recurrent TTS in COPD seems to be exceptionally rare since only a handful of clinical cases have previously been reported in the literature [13, 14]. Here, we present a unique case of frequently recurrent TTS during COPD exacerbation with at least 4 different episodes of TTS.At first medical contact (FMC), a 70-year-old Caucasian woman who admitted to be a heavy smoker and was slightly overweight, presented to the emergency room (ER) with severe dyspnea. Her past medical history, medications, and background information are summarized in Table 1.Hypoxia with pulse oxygen , tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertension were present. Signs of infection, cyanosis, and peripheral edema were absent. Clinical examination revealed expiratory wheezes and prolonged expiration. Chest pain and electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were absent. Chest radiography exhibited bilateral flattening of the diaphragm but no pulmonary infiltrates or pneumothorax. White blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were mainly normal, but troponin T (TPNT) level was elevated (53 ng/L: normal level, <15 ng/L). The patient was admitted to the hospital, and standard treatment for acute exacerbation of COPD was initiated.Soon after admission, increased dyspnea and vague chest discomfort were observed despite normal pulse oxygen saturation. ECG revealed T-wave inversion in several leads, normal QT interval (Figure 1, FMC), and an increased TPNT level of 108 ng/L. Pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection were outruled via computed tomography (CT). Echocardiography (ECHO) revealed a normal left ventricular ejection factor (LVEF) without dyskinesia, at the time (see under Discussion). Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), in concordance with the existing guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) for ACS, was initiated, and coronary angiography was performed. The latter showed no signs of significant stenosis or other pathologies that could explain the patient’s symptoms. During the following days, no other episodes of dyspnea or chest pain were registered, ECG and TPNT level returned to normal, and the patient was discharged from the hospital with prescriptions for standard treatment for COPD. Upon the initially assumed absence of pathology in ECHO, the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis and followed up 3 months after FMC with a new ECHO, which was without abnormalities. During the follow-up period, the patient managed to quit smoking.Almost 32 months after FMC, the patient was again admitted to the hospital. This time she was suffering from exhaustion, dyspnea, and leg swelling for 2 weeks. Bilateral crackles and pitting edema of legs were present. ECG revealed T-wave inversions on several leads without QT interval prolongation (Figure 1). TPNT level was elevated (58 ng/L). Likewise, NT-probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) level was also abnormal (2088; normal age-adjusted level, <450 pg/mL). CT scan showed no signs of pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or pleural effusion. ECHO, at the time, revealed severe left ventricular hypokinesia, most prominent in the inferolateral wall and the septum. LVEF was approximately 30%. Subsequent analysis revealed severe midventricular hypokinesia instead of inferolateral (see under Discussion). DAPT and heparin were given and acute coronary angiography was performed. Once again, no significant pathology was found despite the patient’s severe acute heart failure. Also, as during FMC and upon treatment with diuretics and standard COPD medications, dyspnea and chest pain disappeared, ECG returned to normal, and crackles and pitting edema were gone. TPNT levels decreased as well (Table 2). The patient was then diagnosed with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, and she was prescribed metoprolol, ramipril, and eplerenone. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed 3 weeks after discharge from the hospital. Oddly, no signs of previous myocardial infarction or myocarditis were found, LVEF was calculated to be 55%, and hypokinesia was absent. Subsequent follow-ups confirmed that the patient was feeling well without symptoms of heart failure or angina pectoris. Moreover, NT-pro-BNP level was normal and a new ECHO was completely normal. Treatment with eplerenone was discontinued due to adverse side effects, and after some months, follow-ups were discontinued on the patient’s initiative.Eight months after the second episode (4 months after the last follow-up), the patient was once again hospitalized due to acute COPD exacerbation. Chest pain was denied, but a burning feeling over the back was present. Clinical examination was concomitant with previous episodes, but pitting edema and crackles were absent. The initial ECG at ER was normal except for sinus tachycardia, and cardiac troponin, NT-pro-BNP, CRP, and WBC levels were normal.During the first hours after admission, severe dyspnea was observed and TPNT levels increased to 244 ng/L. ECG now revealed T-wave inversions similar to those found at previous hospitalizations (Figure 1). A small quantity of pleural effusion was found at CT scan, but pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection were absent. ECHO showed severe left ventricular hypokinesia, most manifest in the apical and midventricular segments. LVEF was estimated at 20%. NT-pro-BNP level increased from the previous normal level to 1000 pg/mL. As chest pain was still absent, treatment with intravenous diuretics was started; the patient’s status improved rapidly, but the TPNT level remained unchanged. On day 4, severe chest pain started and the TPNT level increased to 300 ng/L. ECG was still abnormal with unspecific T-wave inversions. DAPT was given, and coronary angiography was once again normal. Astonishingly, soon after coronary angiography, chest pain ceased, ECG and NT-pro-BNP were normal, TPNT levels decreased considerably, and ECHO revealed an LVEF of 50-60% without hypokinesia. She was again diagnosed with myocarditis, and furosemide was prescribed. A follow-up within a month was planned.Almost 2 weeks after being sent home, the patient returned to the ER with dyspnea and acute chest pain. Crackles were present, but chest radiography was normal. Pitting edema was absent. TPNT level was 107 pg/mL. The patient was again admitted to the hospital, and ECHO performed on the next day was evaluated as normal. At this point, the patient was completely recovered and stated that she had had a rough week with high stress levels. The TPNT level decreased, and since a follow-up was previously planned, she was discharged without new prescriptions. She was diagnosed with unspecific chest pain.During the succeeding follow-ups, a grade 3 COPD was confirmed via spirometry (FEV1/FVC0.39, FEV1 39% of normal) and her COPD treatment was adjusted. Treatment with metoprolol was substituted with amlodipine, and a new ECHO was normal with an LVEF of 60%.Six months after past hospitalization (4 months after the last follow-up), the patient was again admitted to the hospital due to severe dyspnea. Chest pain was negated, ECG showed T-wave inversion on leads AVL and I, and TPNT was slightly elevated. ECHO at ER revealed severe generalized left ventricular hypokinesia with midventricular akinesia, but the basal and apical segments were less affected. LVEF was estimated to be less than 20%. On day 2, TPNT level increased to 431 ng/L, NT-pro-BNP level was normal, and T-wave inversions on several leads were observed (Figure 1). During the following days, the patient recovered, ECG returned to normal, and TPNT level decreased considerably. Importantly, chest pain was never observed. ECHO previous to discharging from the hospital showed normal global function with an LVEF of 50% with remaining left basal hypokinesia. Treatment with carvedilol was started since the patient did not tolerated amlodipine, and verapamil was considered contraindicated due to a potential interaction with lithium (see Table 1). During this hospitalization, the patient was given the diagnosis of TTS for the first time. Additionally, a comprehensive review of the patient’s previous medical history and saved ECHO images exposed several episodes of TTS (see under Discussion).Finally, 2 months after her first diagnosed TTS, she was again admitted to the hospital due to dyspnea and elevated TPNT (107 ng/L). ECG was mainly normal. For unknown reasons, an ECHO wasn’t performed and the patient was discharged on the first day. Cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was performed after two months, and no significant stenosis was observed. A previously planned ECHO showed normal LVEF and minor left basal hypokinesia. To date, no new TTS episodes have been observed and concurrently, no new acute COPD exacerbations have been noted.A case of recurrent TTS with different wall motion patterns in the same patient has previously been reported [15]. “Bronchogenic TTS” has been defined as an atypical form of TTS [10–12], and acute respiratory failure has also been associated to atypical TTS [8]. Our review of our patient’s preceding medical data uncovered four probable episodes of atypical TTS. In three of them, our ECHO expert established the presence of midventricular hypokinesia, and in one case, akinesia was established; no signs of right ventricular strain and/or pulmonary hypertension were found (Table 2). Midventricular TTS is a rare form of TTS, found in only 14.6% of the cases [3, 4]. Likewise, in FMC, our ECHO expert found signs of apical hypokinesia but not apical ballooning that might be similar to those found in focal type TTS [3]. In one of the episodes, the quality of the data was insufficient for analysis of ECHO images, and in the last episode, no ECHO was performed. In summary, based on the recently published International Takotsubo Diagnostic Criteria (InterTAK Diagnostic Criteria) [4], International Takotsubo Diagnostic Score (InterTAK Diagnostic Score), and diagnostic algorithm of Takotsubo syndrome [16], we advocate that our patient had had 4 different episodes of atypical TTS (1 focal type TTS and 3 midventricular TTS), the last 3 occurring with high frequency (Table 2). This postulation is supported by the occurrence of new ECG abnormalities (T-wave inversions) combined with transient elevation of cardiac troponins, confirmed transient echocardiographic hypokinesia compatible with TTS, and no evidence of infection, myocarditis (even if the patient was previously diagnosed with myocarditis, there is enough clinical data to dismiss this diagnosis since there is no sign of myocarditis on CMR), or significant coronary artery spasms (coronary angiography and CCTA).TTS is a puzzling and complex medical condition with a largely unknown pathophysiology, and a comprehensive review of it is beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, since TTS is frequently elicited by emotional or physical stressors, sympathetic stimulation has long been proposed as a key factor in TTS [4, 17]. Among others, oxidative stress, infective agents, genetic predisposition, transient coronary artery spasm, and estrogen deficiency appear to be involved in the development of TTS [4, 18, 19].There are several factors in this case that may have contributed to the high recurrence of TTS observed. Female sex, emotional and physical stresses, no ST-segment depression, and psychiatric disorders are the main risk factors in this case, according to the InterTAK Diagnostic Score [16].Approximately 90% of TTS patients are postmenopausal women [3], which might support estrogen-deficiency theories [20]. In our patient, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed approximately 15 years before FMC and she had had no estrogen supplementation (Table 1). Estrogen supplementation might attenuate glucocorticoid and catecholamine responses to mental stress in perimenopausal women [21]. However, there is no evidence of similar responses in postmenopausal women and clear associations between estrogen levels and the development of TTS have not been reported yet. Hypothyroidism might predispose to TTS since 35% of the patients in a single center retrospective study (predominantly elderly female) had a history of hypothyroidism and the use of levothyroxine did not have protective effects [22, 23]. Still, the role of hypothyroidism in TTS is unknown and multicentric prospective studies are lacking.The InterTAK Registry reports a 41% T-wave inversion frequency in TTS [3]. Moreover, initial T-wave inversion has been described in atypical TTS due to acute respiratory failure [8] and even in “bronchogenic TTS” [10]. Our patient’s initial ECG showed unspecific T-wave inversions in all TTS episodes (Figure 1, Table 2). However, no QT interval prolongation was observed, which otherwise is found in up to 50% of TTS patients at admission [3] and might cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during the subacute phase [16]. Interestingly, in a recent study, no ECG differences were found on admission among patients with TTS due to emotional stress compared to patients with TTS secondary to neurological diseases, physical activities, and medical conditions or procedures, respectively [24].In 3 of the episodes (including FMC), the development of TTS was observed during the first hours after hospitalization and after successful respiratory therapy with inhaled drugs. Normally, COPD patients are given high doses of a beta agonist (such as terbutaline or salbutamol) combined with ipratropium. As elevated catecholamine levels seem to play a key role in TTS [4], the additional stimulation of cardiac beta-2-adrenergic receptors might potentiate the development of TTS in patients under extreme stress, such as under hypoxia and acidosis. It has been suggested that epinephrine has a stunning effect on myocardial tissue in TTS due to the induction of beta-2 receptors, which in turn were more frequently found in the cardiac apex during TTS [25]. Thus, the use of a high dose of a beta-2 agonist at the ER might have been important for our patient’s TTS development. In one occasion, the patient presented to the ER with manifest heart failure (Table 2). The medical records reveal that the patient had been inhaling high doses of salbutamol and ipratropium prior to hospitalization. Remarkably, ipratropium has also been proposed as an inducer in “bronchogenic TTS” [26]. Still, the use of ipratropium may mainly have favorable effects in “bronchogenic TTS” since it may reduce the need of beta-2-agonist administration. Even if hypothetically promising, the use of beta blockers in TTS is controversial and, at 1 year, there is no evidence of survival benefit for the use of beta blockers [3]. Glucocorticoids, such as prednisolone or betamethasone, are often administrated in high doses during acute COPD exacerbation. There is no known relationship between the use of systemic steroids and TTS. Despite being a stressor, high-dose corticosteroids may have had favorable effects in our patient since (as with ipratropium) this obviously reduced the need for beta-2-agonist administration during the subacute phase. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effects of cortisone might have relieved the patient’s chronic muscle pain, decreasing the underlying stress levels and possibly even the level of catecholamines.Chronic pain diseases, such as fibromyalgia, may be related to nocturnal “sympathetic overdrive,” and in animal models, increased plasma cortisol and epinephrine levels have been noticed upon long-lasting stress due to chronic pain [27].Up to 42% of TTS patients suffer from psychiatric illness, and half of those had previously been diagnosed with an affective disorder [3]. Elevated sympathetic activity and reduced catecholamine uptake might be responsible for persistent cardiac sympathetic stimulation, increasing the risk for TTS in these patients, when exposed to stressful situations [28, 29]. Furthermore, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been associated with a lower survival rate in TTS [30]. In animal models, lithium appears to stimulate catecholamine release from the adrenal gland and increase catecholamine concentration in the plasma [31]. However, lithium seems to reduce plasma epinephrine response upon insulin stimulation in humans [32]. Thus, it is unclear if a long-standing medication with SSRIs and/or lithium plays a role in the development of TTS.A strong connection between the central nervous system (CNS) and the heart in TTS is highly probable as sympathetic overactivity seems to be an important factor in the development of TTS [17, 33]. Moreover, substantial anatomical alterations in the limbic system have been reported in TTS patients [34]. Decreased cortical thickness in the limbic system might result in less efficient emotional control, predisposing then for TTS. However, this hypothesis need to be confirmed in longitudinal studies [34]. Interestingly, similar brain alterations in the limbic system were found in major depression and bipolar disease when compared that in to healthy controls [35, 36]. These alterations have also been coupled to emotional dysregulation in bipolar disease [36].Previous to FMC, the patient had a long history of bipolar disorder with several episodes of mania or severe depression. Her last hospitalization due to severe psychiatric illness was registered two years before FMC. There is no data indicating that the patient’s background psychiatric illness was acutely aggravated prior to her hospitalizations due to dyspnea. During the 48 months between FMC and the last contact with the ER due to dyspnea, the patient was hospitalized several times due to psychiatric disease, including severe depression and acute stress reaction. Still, none of these episodes was coupled to chest pain or severe dyspnea. Additionally, hospitalizations due to psychiatric illness and dyspnea were registered with a period of several months in between them. This suggests a physical TTS trigger in our patient, in this case acute COPD exacerbation, even if a combination of emotional and physical triggers could also be possible. Interestingly, all the TTS episodes started during the night hours, which also was the time of the day when the patient felt more intensified muscular pain and anxiety. In theory, both conditions, chronical pain and psychiatric illness, might predispose for increased levels of catecholamines and other stress hormones (possibly having an additive effect), which in turn might increase the risk for the development of TTS upon an external trigger. Suffering from both conditions for several years, our patient developed TTS first during her first event of severe dyspnea due to acute COPD exacerbation. This may have been the droplet that caused the beaker to overflow (Figure 2). Here, we suggest an explicatory model in which the patient’s previous medical and psychiatric conditions predispose the development of TTS due to chronic increased stress levels with subsequent elevation of systemic catecholamines. Upon additional stressors or triggers, such as in this case severe dyspnea (with consequent hypoxemia, acidosis, and anxiety), the further catecholamine elevation might initiate a cascade of mechanisms resulting in manifest TTS.Although originally considered a less severe condition, TTS is nowadays considered a serious clinical condition with potentially poor prognosis as early and late mortality can be similar to those observed in ACS [37]. Typical type TTS and atypical type TTS appears to have comparable in-hospital mortality and a similar prognosis at long-term follow-up [38]. Additionally, a recent study revealed that patients with TTS secondary to neurological diseases had the worst prognosis [24]. Moreover, patients with emotional stressors showed the most favorable outcome when compared to ACS patients and TTS patients secondary to physical stressors; a novel classification for TTS has also been proposed (InterTAK Classification) based on the type of triggering event [24].Among others, physical triggers and admission  are connected to adverse in-hospital outcome [3]. Moreover, a high heart rate is associated with increased mortality in TTS [39]. All these features were observed in our patient. However, common in-hospital complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular thrombus, and cardiogenic shock were absent. On the contrary, our patient was fully recovered clinically before leaving the hospital (4 to 16 days, Table 2). Why our patient recovered rapidly is undetermined, but possibly it could be related to the main physical stressor, acute COPD exacerbation, for which there are effective therapeutic management strategies. Besides fatigue and shortness of breath, our patient does not show clinical signs related to cardiac dysfunction. These symptoms are nonspecific and could more likely be caused by her other medical conditions, specially COPD. Curiously, the HEROIC study revealed that post-TTS patients can develop a persistent, long-term heart failure phenotype in which fatigue and shortness of breath are common [40, 41]. The importance of this reported heart failure phenotype in recurrent TTS has to date not been investigated.Acute COPD exacerbations might induce TTS in patients with concomitant psychiatric conditions and/or chronic pain. If so, the use of a beta-2 agonist should be limited or avoided in these patients and other treatment options, such as inhaled ipratropium and corticosteroids, should be prioritized. The patients might also have the benefit of an early ECHO if electrocardiographic abnormalities are observed, cardiac troponin levels are elevated, or if chest pain is described. However, “bronchogenic TTS” has been described as an atypical form of TTS, which might lack chest pain as a cardinal symptom [10].This case report exemplifies the difficulties of the diagnosis of TTS on the onset of acute COPD exacerbation. In order to the prevent recurrence, improve acute treatment, and change the prognosis of “bronchial TTS,” further research and elucidation of the involved mechanisms are demanded. Until then, the recently published InterTAK diagnostic algorithm in TTS is a promising diagnostic tool that, if it had been made available a few years earlier, could have led our patient’s medical history towards an early TTS diagnosis with less morbidity and possibly less recurrence.The authors have no conflict of interest to disclose.The authors would like to thank the patient for her written informed consent.

Herein, we present a rare case of systemic arteriovenous emboli in a healthy 33-year-old male after an episode of acute viral perimyocarditis. The culprits are postulated to be viral-induced myocardial necrosis and resulting proinflammatory state in the setting of negative malignant, autoimmune, genetics, and chronic infectious conditions. The patient was successfully managed with guideline-directed medical therapy and safely discharged to a subacute rehabilitation facility.Simultaneous arteriovenous thromboembolism is an extremely rare phenomenon. This is a case of a 33-year-old male with dual cardiac chambers thrombi, complicated by arteriovenous thromboembolism, four months after an acute episode of viral perimyocarditis.A 33-year-old African-American man (BMI 22) presents to the emergency department of our facility with progressive dyspnea with mild exertion and bilateral lower extremity (LE) edema associated with paresthesia and pain. Four months prior, he was treated for viral perimyocarditis complicated by new onset heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ~ 30–35%).He was noted to be afebrile, tachycardiac to (110 s) BPM, tachypneic (20 s) Br/min, pulse oximetry of 93% on room air, normotensive (110/70 mmHg) and oxygen saturation is 93% breathing ambient air. Cardiopulmonary exam revealed jugular venous distention, diffuse bilaterally crackles, bilateral pitting LE edema up to the knee, reduced femoral, and dorsalis pedis pulses. The rest of the exam was otherwise unremarkable. Initial laboratory findings were significant for neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis (WBC 19 × 103 mcL), elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP 2506 pg/mL), troponin-I 0.48 ng/mL (normal < 0.03), D-dimer 6.6 μg/mL (normal high < 0.46), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 110 mm/Hr (normal high 15), and C-reactive protein 12.7 mg/dL (normal high 0.99). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe global hypokinesis, moderate-to-severe systolic dysfunction, paradoxical septal motion, and multiple biventricular pedunculated mobile echodensities (about 2-3 centimeters in size) consistent with thrombi with trace pericardial effusion (Figure 1). Contrast-enhanced pulmonary embolism (CTPE) study revealed right lobar pulmonary embolus and bilateral small pleural effusions (Figure 2). Lower extremity computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed bilateral occlusion of the superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal, and anterior tibial arteries (Figure 3). Patient underwent urgent embolectomy and thrombectomies, with successful restoration of adequate inflow. Contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI revealed diffuse patchy late enhancement of the epicardial layer of the myocardium and small pericardial effusion consistent with perimyocarditis (Figure 4). He was managed with intravenous furosemide, heparin drip, successfully transitioned to rivaroxaban, and safely discharged to a subacute rehabilitation facility, with significant improvement noted on subsequent follow-ups.Intracardial thrombi are common in patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but multiple intracardial thrombi leading to simultaneous arteriovenous thromboembolic are extremely rare moderately reduced left ventricular ejection [1, 2]. The underlying mechanisms for intracardiac thrombogenesis have been postulated as a complication of blood stasis, hematological hypercoagulability, inflammatory conditions (i.e., viral myocarditis, vasculitis), cardiac dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathic states, or genetic conditions and deficiencies [1–6]. This is a unique case because unlike previously reported cases of multicardiac chamber thrombi, our patient only had a moderately reduced LVEF (30–35%) but with a higher clot burden. Concerning the possibility of hypercoagulability, a thrombophilia screen was performed before the initiation of heparin, revealing normal antithrombin III level, protein S, and protein C along with negative anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant, and beta 2 glycoprotein antibody. Genetic tests for factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation were also unremarkable. Possible explanation in our case includes viral-induced myocardial necrosis (elevated troponin I) prompting chronic inflammatory state (elevated ESR and CRP). Acute viral perimyocarditis causes myocardial necrosis, which leads to chronic inflammatory state and stimulates systemic cytokines circulation, causing further endothelial injury, platelet activation, thrombi generation, and propagation. Acute viral myocarditis is also associated with increased tissue factor (TF); a low molecular weight glycoprotein initiates the clotting cascade and is considered to be a major regulator of coagulation, hemostasis, and thrombosis [1, 7].The optimal management of intracardial thrombi remains uncleared [8]. Warfarin, the antithrombotic therapy of choice for intracardial thrombi management, has unpredictable pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, making it an unattractive option. Thus, there is limited data on direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) usage in intracardial thrombi; DOAC has a better safety profile compared to warfarin [4, 8, 9]. Direct oral anticoagulation (i.e., rivaroxaban) has been extensively studied in deep vein thrombosis, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary embolism and has been used for many years for the prevention of stroke in patients with these conditions [8, 9]. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that if patients are compliants, DOAC could be a safer and effective alternative to warfarin in intracardial thrombi management. Our patient was optimized with guideline-directed heart failure therapy and safely discharged to subacute rehabilitation center on rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 21 days and 10 mg once daily thereafter. The patient has clinically improved and is free of any complication as noted in subsequent follow-up visits. This case illustrates a rare complication of acute viral perimyocarditis and highlights the need for a randomized controlled clinical trial involving the use of DOAC in patients with intracardiac thrombi.This case illustrates a rare complication of acute viral perimyocarditis: intracardial thrombi complicated by simultaneous arteriovenous thromboembolic events. Besides warfarin, there are few data to guide clinicians’ decision regarding choice of antithrombotic therapy in intracardial thrombi management. Our case demonstrates that DOAC is a safe and effective antithrombotic option. Nonetheless, randomized clinical trials are needed before DOAC can be universally recommended as the mainstay of antithrombotic therapy in intracardial thrombi management.Authors have none to disclose.All authors contributed significantly to this manuscript.
Inappropriate Defibrillator Shocks due to Mechanical Inference from an Investigational Device

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) is an investigational device-based therapy to enhance ventricular contractility in systolic heart failure patients who are not candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) owing to the absence of wide QRS complexes or who have failed to respond on CRT. The principal mechanism is based on the stimulation of cardiac muscles by nonexcitatory electrical signals to augment the influx of calcium ions into the cardiomyocytes. The majority of patients receiving CCM therapy have concurrent implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and the manufacturer declares both devices can be used in parallel without any interactions. Nevertheless, proper lead positioning of both devices are crucial, and it is mandatory to check device-device interactions during each and every cardiac electronic implantable device-related procedure to prevent adverse outcomes.Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) can be attained by an investigational device designed to improve the strength of myocardial contractility by delivering nonexcitatory electrical signals to increase calcium ion influx into the cardiomyocytes during the absolute refractory period of the cardiac cycle. The CCM device, Optimizer, is accepted in the United States as an investigational device to treat systolic heart failure patients with narrow QRS complexes or who are nonresponders of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). A CCM unit includes a pulse generator and three pace-sense leads; a sensing lead in the right atrium and two signal-delivering leads implanted at the right ventricular (RV) septum. The manufacturer declares that CCM devices work in parallel with any kinds of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system without affecting the ICD function. We present a case in which CCM leads chatter with the ICD lead in the RV which resulted in inappropriate sensing of the CCM signals by the ICD with subsequent delivery of inappropriate shocks.A 72-year-old male with past medical history of myocardial infarction status postpercutaneous coronary intervention, chronic systolic heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, received a single chamber Biotronik implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) with a Medtronic single-coil defibrillator lead (model 6949-65) in 2005. A year later, the patient also received an investigational device, Optimizer III (Impulse Dynamics, Orangeburg, NY) (model #CCMX8), assembled with St. Jude Medical active fixation pace-sense leads (Model 1388-T), one lead in the right atrium and two in the upper and lower interventricular septum. Prominent electrical signals were identifiable on the patient’s surface EKG when CCM was activated.In August 2014, the old Medtronic lead (Model 6949-65) was found to have a sudden increase in RV impedance to >2000 Ohms with “RED” alert warning of the Biotronik device. The particular Medtronic lead was also a subject of a Class-I recall by the Food and Drug Administration. Subsequently, he underwent laser lead extraction and replacement for a new ICD lead, Medtronic Sprint Quattro (Model 6947) dual coil defibrillation lead. The procedure was uneventful. The function of the new ICD system was assessed, and all the device parameters were found within normal limits. Patient’s CCM was eight years old at that time and was found no longer functional due to battery depletion. Hence, the device-device interaction with the concurrent CCM unit was not evaluated.In earlier 2015, the patient presented with receipt of six ICD shocks without prior symptoms. Interrogation of the ICD disclosed intermittent, noncyclical, and nonphysiologic noise signals. The intracardiac electrogram recording was shown (Figure 1). All the device parameters were found within normal limits.Lead failure was unlikely as all sensing and pacing parameters including lead impendence of the new Medtronic Sprint Quattro lead were normal. The signals (Figure 2) were noncyclical and very chaotic, ruling out the T-wave oversensing or crosstalk from far-field P-wave sensing. The noise signals were not suggestive of electromagnetic interference since external interferences are often repetitive high-frequency signals. The signals were not reproducible with isometric arm exercises. The patient was not physically active prior to or during the delivery of inappropriate shocks excluding the possibility of interference from pectoral myopotentials.The patient underwent fluoroscopic examination (Figure 3) on which right ventricular leads of the CCM unit were found to be chattering with the newly inserted dual-coil ICD lead at the tricuspid annulus. Intracardiac mechanical interference/lead chattering was the cause of inappropriate sensing to result in an inappropriate ICD firing. The intermittent noise signals seen on the device intracardiac electrogram were coincidental with the leads chattering on the fluoroscopy.The CCM device along with two St. Jude Medical right ventricular pace-sense leads was extracted, but the same ICD unit was left in place. During the follow-ups over two years, no further noise signals had been detected by his ICD and the patient had not received any more inappropriate shocks.Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) device is designed to enhance ventricular contractility in a subgroup of systolic heart failure patients who are not candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) owing to the absence of wide QRS complexes or who have failed to respond on CRT. Although CCM therapy falls under the investigational category in the United States, it is approved as one of the device-based therapy for heart failure in Europe. CCM therapy can provide a better quality of life and NYHA functional class by improving peak venous oxygen (pVO2), Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaires (MLWHFQ) in narrow QRS systolic heart failure patients despite its lack in mortality benefits or all-cause hospitalizations [1–3]. Also, improved myocardial contractility induced by CCM was not found in association with an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption [4, 5].The Optimizer CCM system includes a pulse generator and three leads. Current available CCM devices use three pace-sense leads with one lead in the right atrium and two in the right ventricular septum with a minimum of 1-2 cm apart. The right atrial lead detects atrial signals and transmits to the pulse generator. Based on atrial signals and predetermined measurements, the pulse generator generates the CCM signals to the right ventricle during the absolute refractory period [6–8].As the primary use of CCM is for systolic heart failure, most of the patients on CCM therapy have a concomitant ICD device. The manufacturer of Optimizer CCM declares that the system is designed to work in parallel with any CEIDs (cardiac electronic implantable devices) including ICDs and generally does not cause any interruption with ICD functions. However, functional testing of both Optimizer CCM and ICD systems is crucial and mandated to conduct during every procedure including the time of CCM implantation, an addition or revision of a lead(s) to ensure there is neither oversensing of CCM signals by the ICD nor any device-device interactions. It is important to allow an optimal spacing between the ICD lead and the CCM signal-delivering leads to prevent chattering each other in the RV.To our best knowledge, the consequences of CCM-ICD leads chattering as an outcome of inappropriate delivery of ICD shocks which even warranted the extraction of the CCM device have never been reported. In our case, CCM and the old ICD units were working in parallel without any interactions until the ICD lead was replaced. The diagnosis was challenging since signals were similar to those of ICD lead dysfunction but the leads parameters were normal. Under fluoroscopic examination, it was found that all the leads were implanted 1-2 cm apart as recommended by the manufacturer. However, there was the excessive redundancy of some of the leads, and it was believed to be the etiology of leads chattering and oversensing by the ICD. Our case gives us a valuable lesson regarding the crucial role of CCM-ICD leads positioning and mandatory testing of device-device interactions during each and every CEID procedure.Optimizer is an investigational device based on the concept of cardiac contractility modulation. It is designed to improve myocardial contractility without increasing cardiac oxygen consumption by facilitating the calcium handling of cardiomyocytes. The device has a potential to fill up the present therapeutic gap in the treatment of systolic heart failure patients who have narrow QRS complexes or failed to CRT. The majority of patients receiving CCM therapy have concurrent ICD and the manufacturer declared both devices can be used in parallel without any interaction in between. Nevertheless, proper leads positioning of both devices are crucial, and it is mandatory to check device-device interactions during each and every CEID procedure to prevent adverse outcomes.The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.
Transvenous Extraction and Removal of Pacing Leads Placed after Cardiac Transplantation
1Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA2Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Jay Montgomery; gro.cmuv@yremogtnom.a.yajReceived 11 September 2018; Revised 7 December 2018; Accepted 17 December 2018; Published 3 January 2019Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2019 Caleb Norton et al.

With the increased prevalence of these life-saving devices, there has also been an increased demand for lead removal and lead extraction. Understanding the specific subgroups of patients at high risk for complications during and after lead extraction has become imperative to properly manage endovascular CIED leads. There have been multiple published studies describing clinical variables that predict adverse outcomes in CIED system extractions; however, the risk of complications in leads placed after cardiac transplantation has not specifically been addressed to date. We present four cases of transvenous extraction and removal of pacing leads placed after cardiac transplantation. There were no major complications related to extraction in these four cases; however, three of the four patients died within one year after the procedure. While the etiology of death in these cases seemed to be unrelated to the extraction procedure, the indications for extraction (infection in the setting of immunosuppression and calcineurin-associated ESRD and poor sensing/capture possibly secondary to chronic rejection and/or frequent right heart biopsies) likely contributed at least indirectly to the subsequent death.There is an increasing prevalence of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) due to expanding adoption and availability of these evidence-based therapies [1–3]. From 1993 to 2006, it is estimated that index pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implants in the U.S. increased from 46.7 to 61.6 and 6.1 to 46.2 per 100,000, respectively [4]. With the increased prevalence of these life-saving devices, there has also been an increased demand for lead removal and lead extraction (defined as removal of a lead implanted for >12 months or requiring specialized tools) [5]. Understanding the specific subgroups of patients at high risk for complications during and after lead extraction has become imperative to properly manage endovascular CIED leads. There have been multiple published studies describing clinical variables that predict adverse outcomes in CIED system extractions [6–9]. In review of these large retrospective registries, the risk of complications in the cardiac transplant population has not been specifically addressed to date. Based on Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data as of November 25, 2018, there were 3,242 cardiac transplants performed in the United States in 2017. It is estimated that 10.9% of transplant recipients develop bradyarrhythmias requiring pacemaker implantation, with the most common indication being sinoatrial dysfunction [10, 11]. We present four cases of transvenous extraction and removal of pacing leads implanted after cardiac transplantation.A 75-year-old man with a past medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) in 1997 (biatrial anastomosis) was referred for pacemaker system extraction. His initial posttransplant course had been complicated by sinus node dysfunction with a slow junctional escape rhythm, and he underwent implantation of a single chamber AAI Medtronic 8088B pacemaker with a Medtronic 4068 lead placed in the right atrium shortly after his transplantation. In 2007, the atrial lead had low impedance and impending failure, so a Medtronic 3830 lead was added in the right atrial appendage at the time of generator change.He developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, and hemodialysis was started in 2012. He developed recurrent infections in his left upper extremity fistula site (initially methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus but later polymicrobial) in 2016 with eventual pacemaker pocket infection requiring full CIED system extraction.The Medtronic 3830 lead, which had been indwelling for nine years, was extracted using laser energy application along the proximal portion of the lead. The older Medtronic 4068 lead, indwelling for 19 years, required extensive application of laser energy at multiple points along the lead for removal. The pocket was debrided, and the incision was closed using vertical mattress sutures. There was no temporary pacemaker placed, as he was not pacemaker-dependent. The patient was readmitted within 30 days due to concern that the pacemaker pocket site infection had not been fully cleared. This was ultimately treated by drainage of a complex fluid collection associated with the previous pacemaker site. The patient was admitted six months later due to sepsis secondary to disseminated histoplasmosis and ultimately died secondary to multiorgan failure.A 59-year-old man with a past medical history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy who initially underwent OHT in 1994 (biatrial anastomosis) was referred for pacemaker lead revision. His posttransplant course had been complicated by transplant vasculopathy, and he ultimately required a second heart transplant in 2002 (bicaval anastomosis). He also developed ESRD and underwent deceased donor kidney transplantation in 2004. He developed ehrlichiosis in 2011 in addition to cryptococcal pneumonia and histoplasmosis requiring chronic treatment with antifungals. In 2013, he had syncope leading to a subarachnoid hemorrhage and was diagnosed with sinus node dysfunction in the setting of intermittent sinus bradycardia to less than 20 beats per minute. He underwent dual chamber pacemaker placement in 2013 (Medtronic ADDRL1) with a Medtronic 5076 lead in the ventricular position and a Medtronic 5592 lead placed in the right atrial appendage after an active fixation lead was deemed to be unstable.He was admitted for volume overload three years later, and pacemaker interrogation revealed undersensing on the atrial channel due to a gradual P wave amplitude decrease from 4.7 mV at implant to ~0.4 mV, leading to asynchronous ventricular pacing and failure to recognize atrial arrhythmias. No change in lead position was detectable on chest X-ray. An atrial lead addition was planned. However, the left subclavian vein was occluded. He underwent extraction of the atrial lead to obtain venous access. A 12 French Spectranetics SLS II laser sheath was advanced over the lead, and minimal application of laser energy was used to free adhesions. Countertraction using a snare was also employed from the femoral vein. The lead was removed, and subclavian access was retained. A Medtronic 3830 lead was implanted in the right atrium. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and he had no complications within the next 30 days. However, he was admitted with cryptogenic encephalopathy two months later which was thought to be at least partially related to subclinical cirrhosis. He was ultimately discharged to inpatient hospice and died shortly thereafter.A 60-year-old man with a past medical history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent OHT in 1994 was referred for pacemaker extraction (biatrial anastomosis). His posttransplant course was complicated by sinus node dysfunction, and he underwent dual chamber pacemaker placement (Medtronic P1501) in 2008 with Medtronic 3830 leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. He also developed ESRD secondary to calcineurin inhibitor toxicity and underwent deceased donor kidney transplant in 2008. He was admitted with sepsis secondary to Escherichia coli in 2014, and a TEE during this admission demonstrated vegetations involving the pacemaker leads. He underwent extraction of the six-year-old system with manual traction alone. His hospital course was complicated by worsening renal graft function thought to be secondary to sepsis, which ultimately required reinitiation of dialysis. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility with a plan for four weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone but was subsequently readmitted with recurrent sepsis secondary to Escherichia coli within 30 days. He was found to have a left atrial appendage thrombus (despite sinus rhythm). The source of his persistent E. coli bacteremia was unknown; however, it was hypothesized that the left atrial appendage thrombus could have been a nidus for recurrent infection. He was discharged on a 6-week course of meropenem with eventual clearance of the bacteremia and reimplantation of a dual chamber pacemaker 10 months later. He ultimately died three years later after a prolonged hospital stay related to ascending cholangitis and septic shock as well as hemorrhagic shock related to a spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage.A 68-year-old man with a past medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent OHT in 1991 (biatrial anastomosis) was referred for pacemaker lead revision. His course had been notable for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and sinus node dysfunction developing 25 years after transplantation. He underwent dual chamber pacemaker placement in 2017 (Medtronic A2DR01) with a Medtronic 3830 atrial lead and Medtronic 5076 ventricular lead.He was admitted for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response four months after device implantation. Device interrogation during the admission showed undersensing on the atrial channel. He underwent revision of the atrial lead 8 months after the initial implantation with lead removal via manual traction and new lead placement on the posterior right atrial septum due to poor sensing and pacing thresholds elsewhere. He had no immediate complications and was discharged home the same day. He had no complications within 30 days after discharge. However, he died from complications of recurrent aspiration pneumonia unrelated to the procedure two months after lead revision.We present four cases of transvenous extraction/removal of CIED leads placed after cardiac transplantation. All four of these patients underwent extraction for reasons that are plausibly related to their posttransplant status: two related to infection and two due to poor sensing on the atrial channel. Overall, these patients seemed to have a similar or slightly reduced degree of lead binding and tissue in-growth, with a 19-year-old lead requiring significant manual sheath dissection and laser-assisted dissection. More recent leads were removed more easily, often with manual traction. The average procedure duration was 92 minutes (longest 120 minutes, shortest 72 minutes), in comparison to estimated average procedure duration of 135 minutes in the largest single-center registry (though this comparison is clearly confounded) [8]. While no conclusions can be made based on the limitations of this small case series, this does suggest that there is likely no major increase in procedural duration related to prior transplantation status. In addition, three out of four patients died within seven months of the procedure (the fourth lived 44 months), though none had a major complication from the procedure itself. Overall, this may suggest that nonprocedural factors predict high mortality in patients requiring lead extraction after heart transplant.Several attempts have been made to identify high-risk groups for developing adverse outcomes after lead extraction [6–9]. Brunner et al. analyzed more than 5000 cases of transvenous lead extraction in a single center and identified multivariable predictors of major complications [8]. The risk factors for major periprocedural complications were cerebrovascular disease, ejection fraction less than or equal to 15%, lower platelet count, INR greater than or equal to 1.2, use of mechanical sheaths, and use of powered sheaths. This study also identified predictors of all-cause mortality within 30 days of lead extraction, including body mass index less than 25, ESRD, advanced NYHA functional class, lower hemoglobin, higher INR, lead extraction for infection, and extraction of a dual coil ICD lead. Cardiac transplantation was not considered in the patient characteristics in this study, nor was it considered in other studies that attempted to identify high-risk populations [6–9].Several prior studies have shown longer lead implant duration to be associated with an increased need for powered or mechanical sheaths as well as an increase in procedural failure [12–15]. In our series, increased lead dwell time (up to 19 years) seemed to be associated with a proportional increase in lead adhesions, as would be expected in a nontransplant population. Of note, case 4 was the only patient that had leads removed within 12 months of initial implantation. The other extractions ranged between 3 and 19 years after initial implantation.Lead extraction for infection has previously been cited as a risk factor for mortality at 30 days and at one year after lead extraction [8, 16]. In our series, we present two patients who required system extraction secondary to infections (one case due to pocket infection; the other due to lead vegetations and bacteremia). Staphylococcus aureus (as seen in case one) is a relatively frequent pathogen in CIED-related infections [17]. The presence of ESRD with an arteriovenous fistula that became infected seemed to be the initial inciting event for this patient. Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteremia (as seen in case three) is a relatively uncommon cause of lead-related endocarditis, and it is likely that it was related to underlying immunosuppression [17]. Case one required readmission within 30 days due to sepsis secondary to a persistent fluid collection at the site of the previous pacing system. Case three had readmission for sepsis and E. coli bacteremia of unclear etiology. Pocket site infection after extraction is an uncommon scenario after extraction for infection and is presumably related to the posttransplant immunosuppressed state.In theory, chronic rejection leading to progressive fibrosis after cardiac transplantation could be a mechanism of poor sensing and capture over time after CIED implantation. In addition, partial or complete dislodgement may occur over time due to frequent right heart catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy with unintentional force placed on endocardial leads. In the two patients without infection, the initial procedural plan for lead failure was for lead addition rather than extraction and replacement. Given the relatively short lifespan of the patients in our cohort, this seems like a reasonable strategy when feasible. However, given the increased incidence of superior vena cava syndrome in some OHT populations (younger patients, bicaval anastomosis), procedural decision-making should be individualized as increased lead burden is thought to be a risk factor for this entity [18–20].The predominant surgical technique used for cardiac transplantation has changed over time from primarily biatrial to bicaval anastomosis. While this series is too small to detect any difference in safety, it is plausible that surgical technique may affect the likelihood of major perioperative complications. In addition, it is thought that patients with prior cardiac surgery (including transplant) may be protected against some major adverse events, such as hemodynamically significant venous lacerations, due to the presence of adhesions, though the largest available dataset did not detect a significant difference [8].We describe four patients who underwent transvenous extraction/removal of CIED leads placed after cardiac transplantation. There were no major complications related to extraction in these four cases. However, in three of the four cases in our series, the patients died within one year of extraction (2, 3, 7, and 44 months, respectively). Small numbers and the retrospective nature of this series preclude a comparison of the degree of lead binding and procedural complexity. For the same reason, a determination cannot be made regarding the appropriateness and safety of lead extraction for various indications in the transplant population. While the etiology of death in these cases seemed to be unrelated to the extraction procedure, the indications for extraction (infection in the setting of immunosuppression and calcineurin-associated ESRD and poor sensing/capture possibly related to chronic rejection) likely contributed at least indirectly to the subsequent death.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Complete Heart Block in a Diabetic Patient with a Preexisting LBBB and Normal Coronaries, Paradoxically Responding to Atropine

A 66-year-old woman visited our emergency department complaining of sudden onset dizziness and fatigue over the past thirty minutes. Her medical history was remarkable for arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. The patient had a known Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) on past ECGs. Upon palpation of peripheral pulse, a measurement of 32 beats per minute was obtained. No other sign of hemodynamic instability was present. A 12-Lead ECG revealed a complete heart block with sparse QRS complexes with a Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) morphology. Before the insertion of a temporary transvenous pacemaker, atropine was administered intravenously. Shortly after the administration, the patient’s heart rhythm was restored to sinus rhythm (SR) with LBBB. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and in sinus rhythm at the cardiac ICU and was scheduled for implantation of a permanent pacemaker at a specialized tertiary center. Before successful implantation, a coronary angiography revealed normal coronary anatomy with no atherosclerotic lesions.Complete heart block or 3rd degree atrioventricular block is a clinical entity described in case series from the early years of electrocardiography [1]. Its prevalence is quite low at approximately 0.04% in the general population [2]. However, it is found to be increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [3].A 66-year-old woman presented at the emergency department of our hospital complaining of sudden onset dizziness and fatigue over the past thirty minutes. Before her arrival, she was at home relaxing and not engaged in any physical activity. Her past medical history was significant for arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. Her medications were tab. vildagliptin/metformin (50/1000) (mg) BID, tab. amlodipine/valsartan (5/160) (mg) once daily, and tab. levothyroxine 75 mcg once daily. She had a known and asymptomatic Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) and a normal echocardiogram on previous regular visits at her cardiologist (Figure 1). Upon palpation of peripheral pulse, a measurement of 32 beats per minute (bpm) was obtained. Her blood pressure was 115/60 millimeters of mercury and her oxygen saturation 96% on room air. A 12-Lead ECG was recorded and revealed a complete heart block (CHB) with sparse QRS complexes with a Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) morphology (Figure 2). Before the insertion of a temporary transvenous pacemaker, atropine 2 mg was administered intravenously as a bolus infusion. Shortly after, sinus acceleration was observed and conversion of the complete AV block into 2nd degree AV block with 2 : 1 conduction (note that the blocked P waves are more visible in Lead V1) (Figure 3). Eventually, her heart rhythm was restored to SR with LBBB, at approximately 72 bpm (Figure 3). Laboratory studies revealed a normal complete blood count, normal electrolytes, cardiac enzymes, and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit, hemodynamically stable and under continuous ECG monitoring. Her stay at our clinic remained uneventful until her transfer to a specialized tertiary center for a permanent pacemaker implantation (Figure 4). Apart from the implantation, a coronary angiography was performed which revealed normal coronary arteries without atherosclerotic lesions (Figure 5).Regarding the substrate of our patient’s CHB, it is important to mention that increased prevalence of high-degree atrioventricular block in diabetic patients is reported by numerous studies [3–5]. However, randomized prospective studies on the matter are lacking. The pathophysiological mechanisms behind the association of DM with CHB remain largely unclear, with possible explanations including diabetic microangiopathy or progression of bundle branch blocks to a CHB [6]. The clinician, regardless of specialty, should be well aware of the implication of DM in cardiac conduction system abnormalities.The effect of atropine is known to improve AV block at the nodal level and not at the level of the His-Purkinje system [7]. However, in the presented case, the preexistent LBBB during SR and the escape rhythm at a very slow rate (about 30 bpm) with a wide QRS pattern are all suggestive of an infranodal level of this AV block. The mechanism underlying the response to atropine is unknown in this particular case and might be due to vagolytic effect in the context of a “diseased” His-Purkinje system. In the presence of a 2 : 1 AV block, as our patient exhibited after atropine administration, it can be perplexing to differentiate nodal from infranodal block by ECG interpretation alone. During the brief 2 : 1 AV block, we notice that the PR interval is approximately 140 ms, smaller than 160 ms, suggesting that the block is localized in the bundle of His or bundle branches [8]. The most probable origin of the escape rhythm is the left bundle branch distally to the site of block and thus resulting in a typical RBBB morphology. An invasive electrophysiological study would have been proven extremely useful in clarifying the exact substrate of the patient’s complete heart block.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Loeys-Dietz Syndrome Complicated by Right Coronary Artery Pseudoaneurysm
MU Internal Medicine Residency Program, Marshall University, 1249 15th Street, Huntington, WV 25701, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Aman N. Ajmeri; ude.llahsram@iremjaReceived 3 September 2018; Accepted 11 December 2018; Published 23 December 2018Academic Editor: Hiroaki KitaokaCopyright © 2018 Yasir Jawaid et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder notable for rapidly progressive vascular aneurysmal disease and craniofacial defects. Patients are at an increased risk for aneurysm rupture and dissection at younger ages compared to other aneurysmal syndromes. Early surgical intervention is important for prevention of ruptures and/or dissection. The coronary arterial tree is mostly involved as a result of postoperative complications of an aortic root repair. This fact has been sparsely reported. We report a unique case of LDS2 presenting with chest pain that was later diagnosed as a pseudoaneurysm as a result of a right coronary artery graft dehiscence.Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome which is caused by a mutation of genes encoding for transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, and TGFB2. LDS is primarily a connective tissue disorder distinguished by cardiovascular, craniofacial, and skeletal defects. Hallmark findings of LDS are early and aggressive aortic and arterial aneurysms and dissection [1]. We present a case of a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent an aortic root replacement, which was complicated by coronary artery graft dehiscence leading to a right coronary artery pseudoaneurysm. Previous cases have described postoperative coronary artery aneurysms. We believe that a postoperative graft dehiscence presenting as a coronary artery pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication.A 60-year-old male, with a pre-existing diagnosis of Loeys-Dietz type 2, presented to the emergency room with left-sided chest pain for three weeks. He had a sudden onset of left-sided chest pain around 3 weeks ago, which was described as stabbing in nature and was 6/10 in intensity. It radiated to the back occasionally, was exaggerated by lying down, and did not increase upon exertion.He was diagnosed with Loeys-Dietz syndrome in 2005. Genetic testing revealed a TGFBR2 mutation specifically R460H. In 2006, he underwent a prophylactic aortic root replacement for an aortic root aneurysm measuring 4.6 cm with a porcine bioprosthesis. On a routine two-year follow-up, a CT showed a left coronary artery pseudoaneurysm secondary to a left coronary artery dehiscence. He underwent another aortic root replacement and single coronary bypass with an aortosaphenous vein graft. Intraoperative findings revealed a left coronary artery sinus that had detached from the aortic graft, with increased the friable aortic tissue preventing a patch repair, necessitating an aortic replacement. In addition, other aneurysms included a right popliteal aneurysm measuring 4.4 cm, AAA measuring 3.5 cm, left internal carotid artery aneurysm measuring 9 mm, left subclavian artery aneurysm measuring 3.6 cm, and right ICA aneurysm measuring 6 mm.On arrival to our emergency room, his vital signs were stable. Physical exam and electrocardiogram were unremarkable, serial cardiac enzymes were negative, and additional lab work-up was negative. Chest X-ray was obtained and was negative for any acute cardio pulmonary abnormalities. Keeping in mind his medical and surgical history, a cardiac CT scan with IV contrast was ordered which (Figure 1) revealed an aneurysm of the left subclavian artery, a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm arising from the right lateral aspect of the aorta measuring  and the right coronary artery arising from this aneurysm. A three-dimensional reconstruction of this pathology is shown in Figure 2. This was compared to a CT scan done approximately 2 years ago which was within normal limits, showing an aortic root replacement with stable postoperative changes. He was transferred to a specialized facility for surgical repair of the aneurysm.He underwent a redo sternotomy where the superior vena cava was cannulated, a vent was placed in the right superior pulmonary vein, the aorta was clamped, and the heart was arrested. A pseudoaneurysm was identified and recognized to be caused by dehiscence of the right coronary artery from a large defect in the old Freestyle graft. Patch and reimplantation of the right coronary artery were considered, but this was unsuccessful in prior operations. Replacement of the old prosthesis was decided upon.The old Freestyle was excised, and the old saphenous vein interposition graft to the left coronary was detached from it. The annulus was then rimmed with mattress sutures which were passed through the base of a Valsalva graft then a magna pericardial valve. The valve and graft were lowered, and the sutures tied in and cut. The old vein graft to the left coronary could not be directly implanted, so a segment of autologous saphenous vein was interposed. The distal end of the Valsalva graft was grafted to the ascending aorta, and the right coronary artery was anastomosed to the Valsalva.Though the heart was resuscitated, there was significant bleeding from the undersurface of the right coronary, which was not repairable. The heart had to be rearrested, and the right coronary anastomosis was taken down. The ostium of the right coronary artery had become quite macerated, so it was oversewn, opened longitudinally, and another segment of autologous saphenous vein was grafted onto it. The proximal end of that vein graft was joined to the Valsalva graft.The aortic clamp was released again and the heart resuscitated. The patient was warmed and weaned from bypass. Hemostasis was achieved. The heart initially seemed to be functioning normally, but when LV function worsened, it introduced the possibility that the interposition vein graft to the left coronary graft was stenotic. Accordingly, the interposition graft was revised which successfully addressed the stenosis. The heart was resuscitated again, the patient was weaned from bypass uneventfully and hemostasis was achieved. The postoperative course was unremarkable. The patient received a predischarge CT scan which showed no residual pseudoaneurysm. Coronary reimplantation grafts to the RCA and left main were patent. Additionally, the left main graft had approximately 50% stenosis due to mild kinking. The patient was ultimately discharged in a stable condition.Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by aortic aneurysm and arterial tortuosity, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula/cleft palate. Aneurysmal disease is not limited to the aortic root and has been reported in other parts of the arterial vasculature such as vertebral, cerebral, carotid, and branches of the thoracic and abdominal aorta [1]. TGF-beta superfamily is composed of multipotential secreting cytokines which mediate normal cell growth and development, including differentiation, proliferation, motility, organization, and death. Perturbation of TGF-beta signaling is associated with vascular malformation in LDS and is manifested histologically as elastin disarray, loss of elastic fiber architecture, and increased collagen expression in the arterial wall [2].A hallmark finding of LDS is a rapidly progressive aortic aneurysmal disease; this necessitates close monitoring [1]. Dissections of the aorta have been reported in patients as young as 3 months [3]. Surgical therapy is recommended and is dependent on the dimensions of the aorta, rate of progression, valve function, severity of noncardiac features, genotype information, and family history [4]. Dissections have been reported at aortic dimensions of 3.9-4.0 cm. As a result, in adults, surgery is recommended when the aortic root dimension is equal to or more than 4 cm or when there is a growth progression of more than 0.5 cm per year. Surgical intervention of choice is a valve-sparing surgery, as this has a low rate of complications reported and this avoids the need of anticoagulation [1].The coronary arteries can be affected by the disease process itself or occur as a postoperative complication following an aortic root replacement. Fattori et al. reported a case of a young woman with coronary dissection extending from the left main to the proximal LAD and left circumflex artery [5]. Williams et al. reported a case of post aortic root and valve replacement (Bentall procedure) proximal RCA aneurysm [6]. Carrel et al. reported a left main coronary aneurysm following multiple aortic root replacements [7].Patients with LDS may need multiple aortic root interventions many years following an aortic root replacement necessitating long-term surveillance. A retrospective study by Patel et al. discovered that following aortic root replacement, the freedom from reoperation at 5 years is 92% and the freedom from reoperation at 10 years is significantly lower at 54% for LDS patients [8]. This data falls in line with our patient as he required multiple aortic root replacements.Coronary artery dehiscence is a rare complication of aortic procedures. In our patient, it may have been multifactorial. It is most commonly caused by infection of the aortocoronary vein graft suture lines, but it also occurs more frequently in patients with connective tissue disorders or in genetically defined aortopathies such as LDS. Other reasons for coronary graft dehiscence relate to more technical aspects of the Bentall procedure like increased bleeding or difficulty achieving hemostasis that may limit the reestablishment of coronary flow [9]. Pseudoaneurysm formation after aortic root replacement may also be an inherent risk in patients with LDS. A retrospective study by Liu et al. found that 4 of 31 patients that developed postoperative pseudoaneurysms requiring reoperation. They concluded that pseudoaneurysms following aortic root replacement can occur in patients with severe subtypes of LDS as all of their patients had a severe subtype with a TGFBR2 mutation [10]. This was also the case with our patient.Our case is unique because, to the best of our knowledge, this will be the second case of an RCA aneurysm and a first report of an RCA pseudoaneurysm due to coronary artery graft dehiscence. We believe that the natural course of the disease may be responsible for this complication. Multi-institutional studies of postoperative complications following aortic root replacement in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome will be required to determine the incidence of coronary artery involvement.Loeys-Dietz syndrome is very rare and characterized by aggressive thoracic aortic aneurysmal pathology. Surgical repair with an aortic replacement is strongly recommended but can be complicated with coronary artery involvement. Herein, we report an unusual case of coronary artery graft dehiscence leading to a right coronary artery pseudoaneurysm which has previously been sparsely reported in literature. The natural course of the disease may be responsible for this complication.The paper is original and has not been published elsewhere nor is it currently under consideration elsewhere.

Rotate-on-Retract Procedural Automation for Robotic-Assisted Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: First Clinical Experience
Al Qassimi Hospital, Sharjah, Dubai, UAECorrespondence should be addressed to Arif Al Nooryani; moc.oohay@543firaReceived 13 August 2018; Accepted 3 December 2018; Published 20 December 2018Academic Editor: Ertugrul ErcanCopyright © 2018 Arif Al Nooryani and Wael Aboushokka. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The advent of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has dramatically changed the outlook for patients with cardiovascular disease. However, room for improvement and advancement remains in the safety, speed, and efficiency of manually guided PCI. In recent years, the CorPath robotic platform (Corindus Inc., Waltham, MA) has been approved to aid the interventionalist during PCI and other endovascular interventions. Favorable results in several clinical studies suggest that robotic-assisted PCI may further improve patient outcomes while also benefiting the interventionalist through reduced orthopedic strain and less exposure to ionizing radiation. In this report, we communicate our experience with the first-in-human use of a new, optional automation feature that has been added to the platform’s guidance software. This “Rotate-on-Retract” feature is designed to facilitate faster and more precise maneuvering of the guidewire through tortuous vessels by automatically rotating the guidewire whenever it is retracted by the operator. This movement changes the tip’s orientation in preparation for the next advancement. We evaluated this feature in a patient undergoing PCI to treat a severe (90% stenotic), long, diffuse, and calcified lesion of the proximal to mid LAD segments.The advent of percutaneous approaches to the treatment of obstructive coronary disease more than 40 years ago triggered a foundational shift in the management and outcomes of cardiovascular disease [1]. Since the first successful balloon dilatation angioplasty, the field of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has witnessed the evolution of balloons and, later, stents of increasingly sophisticated design and functionality. However, the mechanics of delivering these life-saving devices to the target lesion has largely remained unchanged—the interventionalist must manually thread a coronary guidewire through the peripheral vasculature to the diseased vessel. Navigating the coronary guidewire through the turns, twists, and branches of the coronary vessels typically requires an iterative, trial-and-error process of advancing, rotating, and retracting the wire until the target vessel is reached. The safety, speed, and efficiency of the procedure must be balanced delicately and can vary widely depending on the interventionalist’s experience and procedure volume.Robotic systems represent the newest tool in the armamentarium of the interventionalist [2, 3]. Serving as an extension of the skilled operator’s hands, they translate manual movements of the guidewire, guide catheter, and rapid-exchange device into precise, millimeter-scale, robotically guided ones. The CorPath® GRX System (Corindus Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, United States of America) is currently the only CE Mark-approved and FDA-cleared robotic platform for robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary and peripheral vascular procedures [4, 5]. In its ongoing effort to improve the features, functionality, and utility of the CorPath platform, the manufacturer has recently added a novel, optional automation to the platform’s guidance software. Known as the “Rotate-on-Retract” feature, its function is to rotate the guidewire whenever it is retracted by the operator, changing the guidewire tip’s orientation in preparation for the next advancement. By relieving the need for the operator to perform this action, Rotate-on-Retract facilitates faster and more precise maneuvering of the guidewire to the target lesion. The case presented here represents our experience with the first-in-human use of this new, automated guidance feature.In March of 2018, a 62-year-old male with a history significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia, and a body-mass index of 30.4, presented with symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. After counseling and informed consent, the patient was treated with a staged treatment approach, beginning with PCI and stent placement in the codominant right coronary artery (RCA). He was asked to return three weeks later for angiography and robotic-assisted PCI to the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery.Angiography confirmed the presence of a patent stent in the RCA, a class IIB severe, long, diffuse, and calcified lesion of the proximal to mid LAD segments (90% stenosis; TIMI grade 1 flow). A severe lesion of the first obtuse marginal artery was also identified.Prior to the procedure, the patient was sedated and an appropriate local anesthetic was applied at the radial access site. Clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid, and heparin were administered. Preparation for the robotic PCI procedure involved manual introduction of a radial access guide catheter (6F, EBU 3.5; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) and cannulation of the LAD according to standard practice. The guide catheter was then connected to the Y-connector, which was loaded into the appropriate drive of the robot’s single-use cassette. A coronary guidewire (Balance Middleweight, ; Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA) was then introduced through the Y-connector into the guide catheter, and the distal end was also loaded into the cassette’s guidewire track.With set up of the robotic system complete, the operator was seated at the radiation-shielded workstation and began advancing the guidewire to the LAD under fluoroscopic guidance, employing the joystick controls on the robotic console, with the Rotate-on-Retract feature enabled. On initial advancement of the guidewire toward the LAD, the wire went into a diagonal branch. It was retracted and readvanced, and it went into another new branch. Following the second retraction, the guidewire moved forward to enter the target lesion (refer to the Supplemental Video (available here)). Total time for guidewire placement was a few seconds. Once the guidewire was in position at the target lesion, a rapid-exchange coronary angiography balloon was loaded and advanced for predilation using the robotic system.A rapid-exchange system for the delivery of two everolimus-eluting stents (XIENCE, Abbott Vascular) was subsequently loaded, delivered, and deployed using the robotic system. One  stent and one  stent were delivered to the mid and proximal LAD segments, respectively. Total procedure time was 1 h 55 min with 19.9 minutes of total fluoroscopy time. The entire PCI procedure was performed using the robotic system, and there were no intraprocedural dissections, perforations, device malfunctions, or other complications. At the conclusion of the case, vessel patency was confirmed by angiography with no evidence of residual stenosis and angiographic flow of TIMI grade 3 (Figure 1).The patient returned later for scheduled PCI to the first obtuse marginal artery. He experienced a complete recovery.The evolution of minimally invasive, percutaneous interventional procedures has revolutionized cardiac medicine and surgery, vastly improving patient safety and outcomes after a wide variety of cardiac and peripheral procedures [1]. A great deal of energy and resources have successfully been invested in improvements focused on patient safety and outcomes. This success has provided the opportunity to now pay increasing attention to workflow and procedural efficiency, as well as the safety of clinical personnel.We have been using the second-generation CorPath GRX platform at our institution for 7 months, for a variety of procedures including wiring side branches, main-vessel circumflex, and LAD with steep-angle issues. To our knowledge, this is the first report of first-in-human use of the new Rotate-on-Retract automation. Since this case, we have used it in at least 3 others. In our view, the principal advantage of the feature is that it automates a common maneuver, essentially combining the time usually required for two separate steps—retracting the guidewire and then rotating it—into one. Based on our experience with this feature, we believe that it has the potential to shorten wiring times, which is one of the more time-consuming parts of the PCI procedure, especially in the presence of tortuous vessels and challenging angulation. Indeed, preclinical data presented at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) Conference in October 2017 demonstrated a  reduction in wiring time ( versus ; ) when Rotate-on-Retract was enabled, even among operators who were highly experienced with robotic wiring [6].We found it easy to adjust to the new feature. In this first case, manual rotation was employed a single time as we became familiar with its operation. Since then, we have found no need to use manual rotation in order to reach the target lesion. The automation has helped us navigate very quickly through what would previously have represented very challenging subtotal occlusions.It is noteworthy that the use of the robotic-assisted PCI is also an advantage in terms of the operator’s safety and well-being. While the robotic control of instrumentation affords greater control and millimeter-level precision to the operator, it also allows the procedure to be carried out remotely. Thus, the operator’s ongoing exposure to intraprocedural fluoroscopy is reduced by shielding and physical distance, and at the same time, the need for heavy, orthopedically stressful protective equipment is eliminated.In conclusion, we find that the CorPath Rotate-on-Retract feature is a safe and effective addition to the CorPath platform, improving the maneuverability of coronary guidewire movements. We believe it has the potential to shorten wiring times and enhance the overall efficiency of PCI procedures.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.The authors thank Jeanne McAdara PhD for professional assistance with manuscript preparation, which was funded by Corindus Inc.Supplemental Video S1: navigation of the guidewire toward the LAD using the CorPath Rotate-on-Retract feature.

Four-Chamber Intracardiac Thrombi Complicating Wild-Type TTR Amyloidosis
1Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, USA2Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Rosanne Rouf; ude.imhj@1fuorrReceived 29 June 2018; Accepted 1 November 2018; Published 20 December 2018Academic Editor: Gianluca Di BellaCopyright © 2018 Jan M. Griffin et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Cardiac amyloidosis is a rare disease, and its prevalence varies depending on the type of amyloid protein involved. Several case reports make reference to the increased risk of thrombosis and thromboembolic events in cardiac amyloidosis. We report a case of rapidly evolving, multichamber thrombi in a patient who was ultimately diagnosed with wild-type TTR cardiac amyloidosis.Cardiac amyloidosis results from the abnormal extracellular deposition of amyloid protein in the heart, particularly light chain (AL), wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt), or familial transthyretin (ATTRmut) amyloid [1]. The type of amyloid protein involved determines the patient’s clinical course and treatment options. Several case reports make reference to the increased risk of thrombosis and thromboembolic events in cardiac amyloidosis [2, 3]. We report a case of rapidly evolving, multichamber thrombi in a patient who was ultimately diagnosed with ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis.A 73-year-old African American male presented to an outside hospital with a three-week history of shortness of breath on exertion, 3 pillow orthopnea, and bilateral lower extremity swelling. The patient had been diagnosed with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) 4 months prior, but he stopped his cardiac medications when he developed worsening symptoms. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and ongoing high alcohol consumption. Physical examination revealed bilateral lower extremity edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, and bibasilar pulmonary rales. One day after admission, his troponin I peaked at 18 ng/ml (reference range < 0.04 ng/ml). Electrocardiography revealed nonspecific T wave changes in the anterolateral leads. He was treated for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with aspirin, clopidogrel, low molecular weight heparin, and intravenous furosemide. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35%, moderate biatrial enlargement, and moderate right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction. In addition, a 2.0 cm spherical mobile echodensity was noted to be attached to the left side of the interatrial septum, concerning for myxoma vs. thrombus. Given the TTE findings and the need for coronary angiography, transfer was requested to our hospital.Coronary angiography was performed and showed thrombotic subtotal occlusion of the ramus intermedius coronary artery branch, thought likely to be the culprit lesion. He also had 80-90% occlusion of the second obtuse marginal (OM2) and 50% occlusion of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Due to the need for further evaluation of the left atrial (LA) mass, no intervention was performed. TTE subsequently showed severe global hypokinesis of the left ventricle (LV) (EF 10-15%) and mild LV hypertrophy. The previously noted LA mass measured 2.1 cm by 1.4 cm, appeared pedunculated and was attached to the left side of the interatrial septum with echogenic characteristics concerning for atrial myxoma (Figure 1). Within the right atrium (RA) was a large (3.2 × 2.0 cm) semimobile mural thrombus (Figure 2), and spontaneous echo contrast was also evident in the LV cavity. He remained anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin. Despite this, subsequent TTE imaging demonstrated the development of biventricular thrombi over the course of several days (Figure 3). On hospital day 7, he went to the operating room. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed a new subcentimeter mass on the RV free wall. The previously noted masses in the RA and LA were resected (Figure 4). Two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting was performed with the left internal mammary artery to LAD and saphenous vein graft to OM2. Given that the etiology of his cardiomyopathy was also yet to be determined, an intraoperative LV biopsy was performed. Pathology of both the RA and pedunculated LA masses showed organized thrombus. The LV biopsy was negative for histopathologic evidence of inflammatory infiltrate, granulomas, or eosinophils but was strikingly positive for amyloid deposition by Congo red staining. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated ATTRwt amyloidosis and did not detect an amino acid sequence abnormality in the TTR protein. The patient’s postoperative recovery was complicated by a left frontal cerebrovascular accident, thought likely to be cardioembolic in nature. He was discharged for rehabilitation on postoperative day 15 on chronic anticoagulation with warfarin.We attribute this patient’s rapidly evolving four-chamber intracardiac thrombi to his underlying ATTRwt amyloid cardiomyopathy and concomitant systolic dysfunction. To our knowledge, this is the first report of thrombi identified in all four cardiac chambers in a patient with cardiac amyloidosis. A previously published report suggests one case of multichamber thrombi wherein biatrial thrombosis resulted in death by massive pulmonary embolus [2]. Intriguingly, a study of autopsy patients from the Mayo Clinic involving 116 cardiac amyloid cases (mainly AL and ATTRwt) found intracardiac thrombi in 33% (38) of hearts [4], most of which had a single thrombus. Fifteen of 116 cases had between 2 and 5 thrombi, and the majority of which were in the RA or the LA with 23 embolic events identified, 19 of which were fatal [4]. Another study [5] of 156 patients with mainly AL and ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis reported that 27% had one or more thrombi, with a prevalence of 18% in ATTRwt, though all occurred in the setting of concurrent atrial fibrillation. Related risk factors for intracardiac thrombosis for our patient were intermittent atrial fibrillation during hospitalization, depressed EF from occlusive coronary artery disease, and possible alcohol cardiomyopathy.It has been shown that the intracardiac thrombosis in ATTRwt or ATTRmut amyloid is associated with more advanced amyloid deposition [4]. The mechanism for thrombus formation in cardiac amyloid is not known. Amyloid infiltration may play a role in mechanical dysfunction, which contributes to blood stasis, thus promoting clot formation even in sinus rhythm [4, 6]. Endomyocardial and endothelial damage secondary to amyloid deposition [7, 8] and a hypercoagulable state [9] are also thought to be involved. In cardiac amyloidosis, anticoagulation is indicated for patients with atrial fibrillation, regardless of their CHA2DS2-VASc score [10]. Intriguingly, our patient continued to have thrombus formation while adequately anticoagulated; however, a full hypercoagulability evaluation could not be performed while on therapeutic anticoagulation, and so we cannot rule out a concomitant hypercoagulable state. It is also interesting that this patient evolved into having intracardiac thrombi in all four chambers.In summary, embolization of the LA or LV thrombus into the ramus intermedius coronary artery likely precipitated ACS and reduced EF and the subsequent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis in this patient. Epicardial LV biopsy revealed ATTRwt amyloid on histopathology. This case emphasizes the need for a high suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis in patients with intracardiac thrombosis and LV dysfunction.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Jan Griffin is responsible for the concept/design.

Anomalous Origin of a Right Coronary Artery from Pulmonary Artery

The first case of an anomalous origin of right coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ARCAPA) was described by Brooks in 1885. ARCAPA has an overall incidence of 0.002% in the general population. Most of the cases are asymptomatic; however, it can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, ischemia, and sudden death. A 57-year-old man presented to the cardiologist’s office with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient also had a previous history of coronary stents and heart failure. Initially, he was evaluated with a stress test which was reported as abnormal. The patient then underwent an invasive coronary angiography that revealed anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) and multivessel disease. Cardiothoracic surgery evaluated the patient and coronary artery bypass graft was performed. During the surgery, the anomalous origin of RCA from the pulmonary artery was identified and was successfully corrected by reimplanting the RCA into the ascending aorta. The anomalous origin of RCA is a rare yet life-threatening condition. The RCA due to its location of origin from the pulmonary artery tends to be a low-pressure vessel with a very thin and fragile wall. It also serves as a retrograde venous conduit from the left coronary circulation into the pulmonary artery. This connection results in a left-to-right shunt that explains the increase in oxygen saturation in the pulmonary artery and the high cardiac output which is normally seen in these cases. The clinical presentation can vary from coronary ischemia to heart failure or sudden death. Therefore, surgical correction is recommended even in asymptomatic patients. We present a case of an anomalous origin of RCA from the pulmonary artery which, unlike the origin of left coronary from pulmonary artery, is very rare. Patients with this condition should have early correction even if they are asymptomatic in order to prevent long-term complications.Anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA) is a rare congenital defect [1]. Brooks described the first case of ARCAPA in 1885 [2]. ARCAPA is potentially life threatening due to its consequential conditions such as coronary ischemia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death (in infancy/adolescence/adulthood due to fatal arrhythmia) [3]. This defect is also known to pose as a challenge during surgical procedures, usually because it is incidentally diagnosed in the operation room [4]. Most patients with ARCAPA are asymptomatic and sometimes the anatomical defect may be subtle and thus difficult to visualize. For these reasons, patients may not be diagnosed until the disease is highly advanced, or oftentimes, it may only be detected during a postmortem examination [5, 6]. Many different imaging modalities are available to diagnose ARCAPA. These include echocardiography, magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), and multislice-gated coronary CT angiogram, with the latter two being more reliable [3]. The detection of ARCAPA is usually incidental while patient is undergoing evaluation for other problems, for example, a coronary angiography being done for chest pain [7]. Because of its high-risk profile, surgical treatment of ARCAPA is strongly recommended, even for asymptomatic patients [8].A 57-year-old man presented to the cardiologist’s office as a part of the preoperative evaluation before undergoing an ophthalmological surgery. He complained of shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient had a prior history of coronary stents and heart failure. Physical examination was unremarkable. Echocardiogram reported moderate dilation of the left ventricle and hypokinesis of the apical lateral wall and apical septal wall. Ejection fraction was reported to be 35-40% (Figure 1). The patient was evaluated by a nuclear stress test which came out to be abnormal. The patient then underwent an invasive coronary angiography that showed a 70% eccentric obstruction of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery and a 70% obstruction of the left circumflex artery as well with diffuse calcification. The right coronary artery (RCA) was believed to be anomalous (Figures 2 and 3). Cardiothoracic surgery evaluated the patient and coronary artery bypass graft was performed that identified intraoperatively an anomalous origin of RCA from the pulmonary artery which was then successfully reimplanted into the ascending aorta.Congenital coronary artery anomalies are known to be rare in the general population. The incidence of isolated ARCAPA is only 0.3%–0.9%, with the rate being up to 36% in patients with other associated congenital heart anomalies [9]. The congenital coronary artery defects described in the literature mostly include the left coronary artery originating from the pulmonary artery. There are very few case reports describing the ARCAPA [4]. ARCAPA represents 0.12% of all coronary anomalies and its overall incidence is estimated to be 0.002% in the general population [1]. Many cases are asymptomatic and undiagnosed; hence, the true prevalence of ARCAPA is likely underestimated [9].The most common cardiac defects reported to be associated with ARCAPA were tetralogy of Fallot and aortopulmonary window. Other relatively less common ones include aortic stenosis, septal defects, and aortic coarctation [1].ARCAPA is known to be associated with a risk of sudden cardiac death. A great number of cases were diagnosed postmortem, including individuals from various age groups in whom the pathomorphological features indicated cardiac muscle necrosis [6, 8]. While most cases of ARCAPA, as previously mentioned, are asymptomatic, some patients may be symptomatic with the common presenting signs/symptoms being murmur, angina, dyspnea on exertion, and congestive heart failure [10].ARCAPA is generally a well-tolerated condition in the neonatal period. The high pulmonary vascular resistance in neonates allows forward perfusion of the anomalous RCA from the pulmonary artery. Eventually, as the pulmonary vascular resistance starts to fall, the well-oxygenated blood coming into the anomalous coronary (through the collateral vessels from the left coronary) is forwarded to the pulmonary trunk. This results in a “steal phenomenon” causing chronic myocardial ischemia and symptoms related to chronic left-to-right shunt. This may also result in ventricular dilatation and dysfunction with the severity depending on the shunt size, the number of collaterals, the territory at risk, and the overall myocardial oxygen demands [11, 12].ARCAPA patients may have a normal EKG or they may have an EKG showing deep Q-waves in the inferior leads or anomalies indicating left ventricular hypertrophy. The top diagnostic modalities for ARCAPA include cardiac computed tomography, coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance, all of which provide excellent visualization of the coronary artery and the anomalies with detailed information regarding the origin, anatomic relationship, and course of the anomalous coronary artery [8].Patients who are not surgically treated for this anomaly have been seen to typically have a shorter lifespan which is why immediate surgical treatment (as soon as the condition is diagnosed) is strongly recommended [5]. Surgical correction of ARCAPA is associated with low postoperative mortality, ranging from 2% to 3% [9]. The aim of surgical correction is (I) eliminate the left-to-right shunt and (II) to establish dual coronary circulation. This prevents the potential risk of myocardial ischemia resulting from coronary steal phenomenon. The technique used for surgical repair is influenced by the location of the ostium of the right coronary artery in the pulmonary artery [9, 13].There are various surgical techniques to treat ARCAPA, the most common one being reimplanting the RCA into the right aortic sinus. Other approaches include complete ligation of RCA proximally with saphenous vein graft between the aorta and distal RCA. Another technique is the Takeuchi procedure which is mostly performed in children. It consists of creating an aortopulmonary window and the flow between the RCA ostium and the aorta is established using an intrapulmonary tunnel [8, 14, 15].This case highlights a rare condition of the right coronary artery originating anomalously from the pulmonary artery that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Surgery to correct the defect must be done even in asymptomatic patients to prevent risk of sudden death and other complications arising from ARCAPA.Our patient did have a history of prior coronary stents placed; however, the procedure was not done at our facility, nor did the patient know of the abnormality; therefore, the correction of ARCAPA was not pursued earlier.Authors have no interests to disclose.

RodriguezCopyright © 2018 Fuad Habash et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.ST segment changes are well documented in literature during supraventricular tachycardias. We present a case of a 21-year-old male who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness with an ECG showing atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia and diffuse ST segment depressions. Patient spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm, but he was still complaining of crushing chest pain. ECG taken after conversion showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 65 and showed obvious persistence of ST depressions in majority of leads. Emergent left heart catheterization showed normal coronaries. Such ST depression is suggestive of global ischemia in small intracardiac vessels that cannot be evaluated by left heart catheterization.Chest pain associated with ST changes is concerning for myocardial ischemia or infarction. In the settings of supraventricular tachycardia, ST depression can be seen but usually resolves after restoration of sinus rhythm. In this case report, we present a young patient who had supraventricular tachycardia with diffuse ST changes that remained after conversion to sinus rhythm.A 21-year-old man with history of uncontrolled hypertension and asthma presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset substernal chest pain that started an hour before his arrival. Patient was walking down the stairs while at work and started having chest pain, sweating, and shortness of breath. Patient reported that he became dizzy and felt that his heart was racing. Although this episode of chest pain was unique and graded as severe, he previously had racing episodes that were not evaluated. No family history of cardiac disease was noted.In ED, an ECG was obtained immediately at presentation (see Figure 1, ECG 1). ECG showed evidence of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) at 220 beats per minute consistent with short RP tachycardia. ECG also showed diffuse ST segment depressions. Before any manoeuvres were applied, patient converted spontaneously to normal sinus rhythm but was still complaining of the same crushing chest pain.A second ECG was obtained which showed significant diffuse ST depressions in leads I, II, III, AVF, V3, V4, V5, and V6 and ST segment elevation in leads AVR and V1 (see Figure 1, ECG 2). Although patient’s rapid troponin test was negative, STEMI code pager was activated and the patient was transferred to cath lab emergently.Heart catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. In addition, left ventricular ejection was estimated at 70% and his ascending aorta was normal without evidence of dissection. Troponin level hours later was positive and peaked at 10 ng·dL. On the next day, echocardiography was essentially normal with no wall motion abnormalities. Patient’s electrolytes and thyroid function tests were within normal range. Patient was discharged on diltiazem. Later on, the patient underwent successful and uncomplicated slow pathway modification for the treatment of typical slow-fast AVNRT. No recurrence occurred at 6-month follow-up.This young man previously had palpitations but never sought medical help. This time, his palpitations were associated with severe chest pain that could not be ignored. His rhythm was fast with narrow QRS complexes, and ST segments in the first ECG are depressed in leads I, II, III, AVF, V3, V4, V5, and V6; ST segment elevation was also seen in leads AVR and V1. With such tachyarrhythmia, patient’s heart could not compensate for its metabolic requirements reflecting as ECG changes of demand ischemia. Oddly, once he converted to normal sinus rhythm, his chest pain did not resolve and ST segment changes persisted even though the tachyarrhythmia was interrupted. These ST segment changes were very remarkable and required swift decision. Patient’s coronaries were normal on coronary angiography. Cardiac walls were contracting normally, and no sequelae were seen on echocardiography to explain such electrical changes.ST segment depression is well documented in literature during supraventricular tachycardias. These changes usually disappear after conversion to sinus rhythm, but it has been reported that ST depression can be still seen afterwards [1] [S8]. Slavich et al. suggest to observe such ECGs by the end of episodes [2]. There were no reports on ST segment elevation during AVNRT, and this is the first of its kind to our knowledge. The ST elevations in our patient’s ECGs could not be missed, neither ignored, demanding emergent heart catheterization. We have no solid explanation to such ECG changes. As his epicardial coronary arteries did not show any pathology, we suggest that the patient had global ischemia in small intracardiac vessels that cannot be evaluated in cardiac angiography.In one case series of 21 patients who presented with ST segment depression, 7 of them (33%) had significant coronary artery disease proven by angiography [3] [S7]. In the same series, they studied patients presenting with SVT but did not have any ST segment depression and all of the patients in this group had negative ischemic workup [3] [S7]. ST segment depressions could be indicative of coronary artery disease but is not the only mechanism for such ECG changes [3] [S07]. Another study showed that more than two-thirds of patient with SVT presenting with ST depression and troponin elevation have no coronary artery disease [4]. In addition, they did not find any correlation between the degree of ST segment depression and heart rate to the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Also, Bukkapatnam et al. showed that ST segment depression and the increase of troponin were not significant predictors of CAD [4] [ref from S1 (3)].Troponin elevation is expected when tachycardia ensues. About a third of patients with SVT have troponin elevation [5] [S5]. Numerous conditions other than myocardial infarction can be the cause; congestive heart disease, sepsis, pulmonary embolus, and thoracic injuries are most commonly seen [6] [S9]. The pathophysiology of such troponin elevations in non-ACS (non-acute coronary syndrome) is not well understood, but hypothesized to be due to endothelial dysfunction and demand ischemia or due to direct toxic effects of catecholamines [7] [S3]. In episodes of tachycardia, many researchers believe that the heart is craving more oxygen to fulfil its metabolic requirements but coronary blood flow happens during diastole which is shortened in tachycardia [1, 8, 9] [refs from S5 (13, 17, 19)]. Other authors think that myocardial stretch plays a role in troponin elevation through brain natriuretic peptide [8–10] [refs from S5 (17, 19, 20)]. Another hypothesis mentions increased permeability of myocardial cells during stress leading to troponin leak [11] [ref from S1 (7)].Patients who had troponin elevation were found to have more comorbidities than those without [7] [S3]. In addition, patients with troponin elevation had increased risk of death, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalisation due to cardiac causes [7] [S3]. Other studies disagree and think that troponin elevation in SVT is not related to future outcomes [1, 12, 13] [refs from S3 (6, 30, 38)]. Controversies are probably due to different duration of follow-up of the studies and difference in demographics of the patients that were studied. For example, studying young patients with SVT and troponin elevation without comorbidities will have better outcome than patients who have multiple comorbidities and are old. Duration of tachycardia did not seem to correlate with the degree of troponin elevation [13] [S6].A very recent study picked a random sample of patients with troponin elevations from hospital charts, 362/458 patients (79%) had troponin elevation that were contributed to non-ACS causes [6] [S9]. The first troponin elevations were 10, 0.4, and 0.14 in patients with STEMI, non-STEMI, and non-ACS, respectively [6] [S9]. Peak in STEMI was 34.7, peak in NSTEMI was 1.34, and peak in non-ACS was 0.21 [6] [S9]. Our patient had a troponin elevation similar to “STEMI” category but had normal coronaries.The learning points of the study are as follows:
(i)Persistence of ST segment changes after restoration of sinus rhythm in patients presenting with SVT should be further evaluated for coronary artery disease(ii)Troponin leak in the setting of tachycardia is expected, yet further evaluation should be sought on individualised basesThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.
Resembling Left Ventricular False Tendon in a Father and His Daughter

Although LVFTs have been associated with various heart pathologies and investigated embryologically and histologically, there is only one report in the literature connoting possible hereditary transmission of this entity. We reported a father and his daughter having similar types of LVFTs with regard to location and thickness. With this report, we will contribute in the literature in respect to potential genetic inherence of LVFTs.Left ventricular false tendons (LVFTs) are linear fibrous or fibromuscular bands that extend between ventricular septum and papillary muscle, left ventricular free wall, or apex [1, 2]. LVFTs were incidental findings at cadaver dissection in early days, but later technical improvement in the heart imaging such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging let the percentage of LVFT visualization rise [2, 3]. LVFT prevalence in the literature spreads over a wide range, while in the earliest reports, it was 0.5%; current investigations have reported up to 78% [3].Although there is no consensus on the implication of LVFTs in heart diseases, they have been associated with various clinical manifestations in otherwise structurally normal hearts such as functional murmur, preexcitation, idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, infective endocarditis, cavitary thrombi, regional myocardial hypertrophy, repolarization abnormalities, and genesis of J-waves [2–9].Our knowledge about LVFT continuously grows. In order to understand clinical implication of LVFT, we need to evaluate this entity in all its aspects. The questions rose regarding its clinical implication let researches to extend histologic characteristic and embryologic development of LVFT. The lacking information regarding genetic transition of LVFT is the missing link of this chain. We offered an insight into genetic aspect of this entity by reporting these cases.An 18-year-old previously healthy girl presented with complaint of palpitation. She has experienced palpitation 2 or 3 times a month for 3 years. She did not declare other triggering factors for palpitation with the exception of caffeine. She stated that her palpitation episode sometime lasts one hour, and it is rarely accompanied by dizziness. On physical examination, the followings were noted: normal S1 and S2 without added sounds (S3 or S4) and murmur on cardiac auscultation, blood pressure 118/76 mmHg, heart rate 78/min, and normal breathing sounds. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with normal QRS morphology. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a structurally normal heart with the exception of a broad false tendon within the left ventricle extending between apical lateral wall and basal septum (Figures 1(b)–4(b)). Ambulatory rhythm monitoring showed no isolated premature ventricular complexes, ventricular couplets, or runs during 24 hours. She was asymptomatic during the 24 hours of ambulatory rhythm monitoring. She was advised to obtain an electrocardiogram at the time of palpitation from the nearest medical center.The father of the girl in case 1, 52 years old, was admitted in our outpatient clinic due to a periodic examination of coronary artery disease. He had coronary bypass surgery history. At the time of admission, he was asymptomatic with regard to coronary artery disease. On physical examination, the followings were noted: normal S1 and S2 without added sounds (S3 or S4) and murmur on cardiac auscultation, blood pressure 132/82 mmHg, heart rate 72/min, normal breathing sounds, and no peripheral edema.A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST changes in precordial leads. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal systolic contraction in all left ventricular wall segments. There was no evidence of left ventricular cavity enlargement or hypertrophy according to the measurements suggested by chamber quantification guideline [10]. During the evaluation, a left ventricular false tendon extending between apical lateral wall and basal septum was noticed (Figures 1(a)–4(a)).Although there are several reports in the literature regarding embryologic development, histologic evaluation, and its clinical association of LVFT, to date, genetic aspect of LVFT has not been scrutinized thoroughly. Many years ago, genetic transmission of LVFT became the main topic of conversation upon a presentation of resembling LVFTs in a mother and her son in Russian literature [11]. Unlike the previous one, we reported LVFT in a father and his daughter with a similar point of attachment and thickness in the left ventricle. To our best knowledge, this is the second report to point out the potential genetic inheritance of LVFT in the literature.Clinical implication of LVFTs is still not well understood although several reports have showed their association with some heart diseases [3]. In order to disclose a potential link between LVFT and heart disease, histologic feature and embryologic development of this entity have been studied. Although embryologic origin of LVFT has not been fully elucidated, they are thought to be derived from inner muscle layer of primitive heart [2, 12, 13]. Histologic analyses of LVFTs revealed that they can contain fibrous tissues, myocardial fibers, elastic fibers, and blood vessels [2, 14, 15]. LVFTs can be classified into three types based on their thickness although their functional differences remain unknown. Fibrous type is less than 1.4 mm in diameter, fibromuscular type is 1.5–2.4 mm, and muscular type is larger than 2.5 mm [2]. Our both cases had muscular type false tendon based on their thickness (Table 1).LVFTs are classified into 5 types with varying percentages based on the points of attachment. Type 1 (66%) extends between posteromedial papillary muscle and ventricular septum, type 2 (12%) between anterolateral papillary muscle and posteromedial papillary muscle, type 3 (11%) between anterolateral papillary muscle and ventricular septum, type 4 (9%) between left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum, and type 5 (1%) between one left ventricular free wall and another left ventricular free wall [16]. Our both cases had type 4 LVFT based on the points of attachment where the tendons extended between apical lateral wall and basal septum (Figures 1–4).Although there is no consensus on clinical importance of LVFTs [3], it might be important to visualize the false tendon by cardiac imaging in some cases. In those who undergo heart surgery or left ventricular catheter ablation, the presence of LVFT must be known by the operator to avoid damage to these tendons, in view of the possible presence of the conduction system and coronary artery branches in the tendons [2]. As well as, because LVFTs can be the origin of the infective endocarditis [8, 17] and cavitary thrombus [18, 19], clinician must be vigilant in those who have unknown source of fever or systemic embolism.Several heart diseases and electrocardiographic abnormalities have been associated with LVFTs [2–4, 20–22]. However, in our both cases, we failed to show any heart pathology linked to LVFT as reported in the literature. Even though the girl presented with complaint of palpitation, ambulatory rhythm monitoring showed no arrhythmia during 24 hours. It is worth noting that she was asymptomatic during the recording.By reporting these cases, we draw attention of clinicians on the potential genetic inheritance of LVFTs. Clinical studies are warranted to confirm the genetic inheritance and reveal the pattern of genetic transmission of LVFTs.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Hyperthyroidism with Biventricular Heart Failure and Cirrhotic Transformation of the Liver

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Cardiovascular symptoms remain the most common presenting features and leading causes of death in hyperthyroidism. We report a young female with reported thyroid disease and medication noncompliance presenting with atrial fibrillation, severe atrioventricular regurgitation, severely dilated right heart with reduced function, and moderate pulmonary hypertension (PH), which was further complicated by congestive liver injury with ascites and pancytopenia. Thyroid work-up revealed suppressed TSH, elevated free T4 and T3 along with elevated anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, suggesting Graves’ thyrotoxicosis. Ultrasound of the abdomen was suggestive of liver cirrhosis and ascites, which was thought to be cardiac cirrhosis, after multiple negative work-ups for alternate causes of cirrhosis. Ascitic fluid analysis revealed portal hypertension as the cause. The patient was restarted on antithyroid medication with gradual improvement of thyroid function and in clinical and echocardiogram findings. In contrast to primary PH that carries a poor prognosis and has limited treatment options, PH due to Graves’ disease carries a good prognosis with prior reports of resolution after appropriate treatment, emphasizing the importance of early recognition. Also, unlike cirrhosis caused by alcohol or viral hepatitis, the effect of cardiac cirrhosis on overall prognosis has not been clearly established.Cardiovascular symptoms remain the most common presenting features and leading causes of death in hyperthyroidism [1, 2]. Varied cardiac presentations include atrial fibrillation (AF), chamber enlargement (more often right-sided), congestive heart failure (CHF), valvular regurgitation (atrioventricular more than semilunar), and pulmonary hypertension (PH), most of which have been reported to reverse with correct treatment [2–6]. Here, we present a case of a severely dilated right heart with moderately reduced function, severe atrioventricular regurgitation, and moderate PH due to medication noncompliance in a young female with Graves’ disease, which was further compounded by congestive liver injury and decompensated cirrhosis.A 31-year-old female presented with abdominal distention, leg swelling, and dyspnea on exertion. She denied past medical history except for a thyroid condition for which she was on and off of medications. Examination revealed conjunctival pallor and scleral icterus. She was afebrile and normotensive but tachycardic with heart rate 160-190/minute. Cardiovascular exam revealed an irregular rhythm, systolic murmur at the lower left sternal border and cardiac apex, and an elevated JVP. Chest radiograph displayed cardiomegaly. EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Figure 1). She received metoprolol with adequate rate control. Brain natriuretic peptide was over 4000. Urine drug screen was negative. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reported an ejection fraction (EF) of 43%, global hypokinesia, grade 2 diastolic dysfunction, anterior mitral valve prolapse (MVP), very severe mitral regurgitation (MR), severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), severely dilated atria, and right ventricular enlargement with moderate PH.Thyroid work-up revealed suppressed TSH at <0.005 (ref: 0.45 – 5.33) uIU/ml, elevated free T4 at 5.36 (ref: 0.58 – 1.64) ng/dl, free T3 of 28.31 (ref: 2.2-4.10) pg/ml along with elevated anti-thyroglobulin antibodies at 12 (ref: ≤4) IU/ml, thyroid peroxidase antibodies at 3841 (ref: ≤8) IU/ml, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin >500% (≤122%), suggesting Graves’ thyrotoxicosis. Thyroid ultrasound showed significantly enlarged, mildly heterogeneous lobes without discrete nodules. Methimazole was started with plan for subsequent radioactive iodine ablation.Other notable labs included elevated alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio with normal transaminases. Subsequent ultrasound of the abdomen showed moderate ascites with liver architecture suggestive of cirrhosis. Paracentesis removed 4.4 l of ascitic fluid with serum ascitic albumin gradient (SAAG) over 1.1, suggesting portal hypertension. She denied alcohol use and had no other risk factors for nonalcoholic liver disease including obesity (low normal body mass index of 18.4 kg/m2), systemic hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes. Work-up was negative for immune causes of cirrhosis, including antinuclear antibody (ANA), ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), and anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA). Ferritin level was within range, and the hepatitis panel was negative.The patient was discharged home on a beta-blocker and diuretics. Follow-up office visit showed improving thyroid functions TSH at <0.005 (ref: 0.45 – 5.33) uIU/ml but normal free T4 at 0.60 (ref: 0.58 – 1.64) ng/dl, and slightly elevated free T3 at 4.28 (ref: 2.20 – 4.10) pg/ml. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and normal rate. Subsequent echocardiogram at 2 months showed normal left ventricular systolic function with EF of 61%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, normal diastolic function, moderate MR and TR, and top-normal right-sided pressures. Ultrasound of the abdomen at that time showed persistent appearance of cirrhosis with improved ascites.Several years of research has shown that hyperthyroidism has cellular, molecular, and hemodynamic effects on the cardiovascular system, with varied clinical presentations [2, 4, 5, 7]. Myocellular effects comprise of increase in myocellular contraction with subsequent increase in oxygen demand among cardiac myocytes [8, 9]. Hemodynamic effects include increased preload (by increased diastolic relaxation and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activation) and decreased afterload (decreased systemic vascular resistance) [2, 10]. These myocellular and hemodynamic alterations can lead to tachyarrhythmias, thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy, decreased exercise tolerance, and rapid decompensation [2]. In their study of thyrotoxic heart disease patients, Wu et al noted 63% to have heart failure, 60% to have MR and TR, and 44% to have PH [5]. In uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, impaired collagen metabolism may lead to myxomatous leaflet and chordae degeneration, with subsequent MR [3, 4, 11, 12]. Another probable cause of valvulopathy is the hemodynamic changes in thyrotoxicosis, including increased venous return and dilatation of cardiac chambers and valve annulus [2, 13]. Serious cardiopulmonary symptoms from uncontrolled hyperthyroidism can be detrimental.Potential explanations for PH include autoimmune or high cardiac-output-mediated endothelial damage in addition to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance due to decrease in pulmonary vasodilators and an increase in vasoconstrictors [9, 14]. Also, in hyperthyroidism, there is an accelerated metabolism of intrinsic and extrinsic pulmonary vasodilators (prostacyclin, nitric oxide, and acetylcholine) and an impaired metabolism of pulmonary vasoconstrictors (serotonin, thromboxane, and endothelin-1) [14, 15]. PH, if left untreated, can cause increased right ventricular afterload with right heart dilatation and failure, which is compounded by functional TR by annulus dilatation [16].This right heart failure in long-standing hyperthyroidism can, in turn, cause passive liver congestion called congestive hepatopathy and clinical as well as histological changes of liver cirrhosis [13, 17]. Liver dysfunction may range from mild hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatomegaly to ascites and liver cirrhosis. Khemichian and Fong have also described the association of Graves’ disease with primary biliary cirrhosis or autoimmune hepatitis [13]. However, in our patient, the diagnosis of cardiac cirrhosis was thought more likely after multiple negative serological work-ups including ANA, AMA, and ASMA levels. Also, risk factors for other causes of cirrhosis were absent in our patient, including alcohol use and features typical for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, including obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, or systemic hypertension.Of the various manifestations of thyrotoxicosis, our patient presented with atrial fibrillation and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, severe valvular disease, and PH, which was further complicated by congestive liver injury as evident by abdominal ascites with a SAAG >1.1. In contrast to primary PH that carries a poor prognosis and has limited treatment options, PH due to Graves’ disease carries a good prognosis, with prior reports of resolution after appropriate treatment [3, 6, 11, 14], emphasizing the importance of early recognition. Also, it is very rare for hyperthyroidism-driven heart failure to lead to cirrhosis, and cirrhosis has been reported mostly in chronic right heart failure [18]. Unlike cirrhosis caused by alcohol or viral hepatitis, the effect of cardiac cirrhosis on overall prognosis has not been clearly established [18, 19]. By this case, we want to highlight the importance of considering hyperthyroidism early on in the differential for unexplained valvular regurgitation and heart failure and also considering cardiac cause as a differential for liver cirrhosis.Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to manuscript preparation.An earlier version of this work was presented at “Annual Meeting of the House of Delegates of the Pennsylvania Medical Society,” 2018.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.
Large Pericardial Cyst Presenting as Acute Cough: A Rare Case Report

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Pericardial cysts are an uncommon cause of mediastinal masses and may be found incidentally on imaging. Symptoms commonly include cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath elucidating a broad differential on examination. Diagnosis is predominantly made using imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI, and CXR with treatment including resection for symptomatic cysts and observation for asymptomatic cysts. Due to a lack of specific signs and symptoms towards identifying pericardial cysts, many are identified at a later stage requiring resection by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). We present the rare case of a patient presenting with a sudden onset cough, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain found to have a large pericardial cyst.Pericardial cysts are uncommon benign congenital anomalies located in the mediastinum. They typically present in the middle mediastinum, representing approximately 33% of mediastinal cysts and 6–7% of mediastinum masses [1]. Pericardial cysts are increasingly rare with a majority detected incidentally and an incidence rate of 1 in 100,000 [2–4]. Most cysts are identified in the third or fourth decade of life equally affecting both males and females [2]. Pericardial cysts are commonly congenital and largely asymptomatic; however, symptoms may present in light of complications such as mass effect, rupture, inflammation, and hemorrhage [5, 6]. Other documented etiologies of pericardial cysts include inflammatory etiologies such as rheumatic pericarditis, bacterial infection particular from tuberculosis, trauma, and postcardiac surgery [5]. The management of patients with pericardial cysts includes conservative management with routine follow-up, percutaneous aspiration, and surgery. Typically, a cyst will only require follow-up for observation for increase in size; however, an enlarging or symptomatic cyst may require surgical removal [5]. We present the case of a patient with acute onset worsening cough, shortness of breath, and sudden onset pleuritic chest pain found to have a large pericardial cyst.A 43-year-old female with a past medical history of severe allergy-induced asthma and chronic nasal drip presented to the clinic with worsening cough and chest tightness for 10 days and was treated for bronchitis with steroids and antibiotics. She then presented to the emergency department with severe and acutely worsening shortness of breath, sudden onset pleuritic chest pain, and sharp radiating pain between both shoulder blades with deep inspiration. At time of presentation, the patient was afebrile with vital signs within the normal limits. Lab work was insignificant with negative leukocyte count and negative cardiac enzymes. A chest X-ray demonstrated an abnormal right cardiomediastinal silhouette with large opacity over the right mediastinum adjacent to the right atrial border. A follow-up CT scan revealed a large right-sided mass adjacent to the right atrium and extending into the right chest measuring 5.1 cm × 9 cm × 4.3 cm (Figure 1). Her last imaging study was a fluoroscopy study 10 years ago that showed no indications for a mediastinal mass. An echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction (55–59%), no wall motion abnormalities, and a cyst near the right atrium. The patient had continued pleuritic chest pain and difficulty breathing and the decision was made to perform video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for pericardial cyst removal. The patient underwent general anesthesia with a 37 French left-sided double-lumen tube. Standard ASA monitors were applied. Two large-bore peripheral IVs and an arterial line were placed for continuous blood pressure monitoring. Intraoperatively, a large cystic lesion was adherent to the pericardium (Figure 2). There was no solid component and no obvious communication with the pericardium. Part of the cyst wall was left on the phrenic nerve to preserve it. The patient tolerated the procedure well, had no postoperative complications, and was discharged home on postoperative day number two. The final pathology report revealed benign, acute inflammatory pericardial cyst.Pericardial cysts are rare, benign causes of mediastinal masses that are largely asymptomatic in nature. With a low incidence rate and most cases presenting incidentally, pericardial cysts are difficult to identify without the use of imaging modalities. Symptomatic pericardial cysts are rare and are a result of various etiologies ranging from inflammatory pathology to mass effect [5].This case is a unique presentation of a patient who presented with acute onset worsening shortness of breath, cough, and sudden onset pleuritic chest pain. It is unclear when the cyst began to develop and how rapidly it developed prior to her presentation. However, imaging 10 years prior revealed no evidence of a cyst. Her recent episode of bronchitis that was treated with steroids and antibiotics may have triggered a rapid enlargement of the cyst, precipitating her symptoms that resulted in her admission to the hospital. Her presentation of pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea are common symptoms for many diagnoses including pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pneumothorax, and pericarditis. In addition, pericardial cysts may be confused with other pathologies, and the initial read on CXR was read as Morgagni’s hernia. Although rare, it is important for clinicians to include a pericardial cyst in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with pleuritic chest pain and a mass on CT imaging.Cysts range in size from 2 to 3 cm but have been reported as large as 28 cm [7]. The cysts appear as well-defined or oval masses in contact with the heart. Most frequently, the cyst is found in the right costophrenic angle but may also be found elsewhere in the mediastinum [4, 8]. On a CT scan, a pericardial cyst typically appears as a well-defined, nonenhanced homogenous oval mass adjacent to the pericardium [9]. If symptoms are present, they are usually due to compression of adjacent organs, rupture, or inflammation and include atypical chest pain, dyspnea, and persistent cough [4]. A cyst located adjacent to the pericardium may lead to symptoms due to medullated fibers that respond to stretching or touching of the pericardium [10]. Cardiac tamponade, infection, hemorrhage, and sudden death are life-threatening complications that have been previously reported in these patients [4]. Management of a pericardial cyst depends on the size of the cyst and patient presentation. Observation, percutaneous drainage, and resection are three possible options. Observation is recommended unless the patient has chest pain, tamponade, or there is uncertainty of malignant potential. Serial transthoracic echocardiography is used to monitor asymptomatic patients and ensure a benign course in which the pericardial cyst can resolve spontaneously [9] In addition, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is also used to help identify the cyst in atypical locations and differentiate it from other pathologies such as an aneurysm, appendage, or solid tumors. Antonini-Canterin et al. presented two case reports in which the TEE was used to identify the cyst in two atypical locations. One cyst appeared in the posterior wall of the right pulmonary artery and another cyst was found compressing the left atrium and the outflow of the pulmonary veins [11]. Furthermore, cardiac computed tomographic scanning can be used alongside the TEE to help identify the relationship between the cyst and the pericardium [11]. Resection with either a thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been the preferred approach for patients with a symptomatic cyst [5]. Surgery has been identified as the only definitive cure. Since operative risks of minimally invasive techniques are extremely low, it would seem reasonable to offer resection for all pericardial cysts in otherwise healthy patients for whom the risk of surgery is low [5].Although rare, pericardial cysts can present with various clinical presentations and can range from asymptomatic to life-threatening in nature. This case is a unique presentation of a patient who presented with the development of a pericardial cyst with rapidly worsening symptoms that required resection with VATS. VATS has numerous advantages including decreased pain and shorter postoperative recovery and has become a common treatment option for patients with enlarging or symptomatic cysts. Physicians must not neglect to include pericardial cysts into the broad differential of patients presenting with acute onset cough, shortness of breath, or pleuritic chest pain.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.All authors worked in all 4 aspects of authorship as per guidelines.

However, the physiology and pathogenesis are different. It is imperative to treat stress-induced cardiomyopathy as an acute coronary syndrome, and once diagnosed, it is imperative to assess and treat heart failure and wait for the impaired myocardial energetics to resolve. At times, the myocardial recuperation is quick that we miss the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.Takotsubo is a rare stress-induced cardiomyopathy that mimics a myocardial infarction but is characterized by the absence of any coronary artery occlusion. Most patients present with the typical systolic apical ballooning, particularly of the left ventricle (LV). The very first case was described in the 1990s in Japan and today occurs in 1-2% of troponin-positive acute coronary syndromes or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions [1–3]. We describe a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with an improvement in her ejection fraction in a few weeks.A 74- year -old female with a past medical history of asthma and hypertension presented to the Emergency Department with typical anginal chest pain, 10/10 in severity, midsternal, pressure like “someone sitting on my chest”, radiating to the left arm, and associated with an episode of vomiting five hours prior to arrival. She also reported several similar prior episodes with exertion that lasted for a few minutes, over the last four months but were less intense. She stated that she started to have the pain upon hearing about her granddaughter’s diagnosis of cancer.Her cardiac history was significant for an episode of similar chest pain approximately fifteen years ago. She had a coronary angiogram done which revealed normal coronaries. She also had episodes of chest pain five years ago and had an abnormal nuclear stress test followed by a coronary angiogram, which showed normal coronaries as well. On both these occasions, the patient was supposedly told she had a “temporary” disease.On admission, physical examination revealed an elderly woman in moderate distress due to pain with a blood pressure of 146/79 mmHg. Other vital signs were within the normal limit. Physical exam was also remarkable for bilateral basal crackles. Remainder of the physical exam was normal. Electrocardiogram (EKG) initially showed T wave inversions in leads I and aVL (Figure 1) when compared to her EKG a year ago (Figure 2). There were no ST elevations. A repeat EKG showed dynamic T wave changes with new T wave inversions in all the lateral leads (Figure 3). Chest X-ray (CXR) showed cardiomegaly, central pulmonary vascular prominence, and mild atelectasis over the lung bases (Figure 4). Labs including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were within normal limits. Troponin initially was 2.68 and peaked at 16.08. At admission, she received loading doses of dual antiplatelet therapy and was placed on a heparin drip for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). On risk stratification, she had a total InterTAK diagnostic score of 61 points, which made her have a 58.6% chance of having Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30-35%, moderate apical hypokinesis, and moderate mitral regurgitation with regional wall motion abnormalities. She was known to have a normal LVEF of 60-69% a year ago.Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with apical ballooning (Figure 5) and an elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP). She was treated with aspirin 81 mg, warfarin, ACE inhibitor, beta blocker, and a moderate-intensity statin prior to discharge. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram in 4 weeks revealed recovery of her left ventricular ejection fraction.A systematic review by Gianni et al. concluded that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy accounted for 1.7 to 2.2% of cases presenting as suspected acute coronary syndrome [2]. It occurs more commonly in postmenopausal women; as much as 9.9% were female with the mean age of 66.4 years, as reported in the International Takotsubo Registry [4]. The real pathogenesis has not been well understood. The most common explanations are catecholamine excess, coronary artery spasm, neurogenic stunning, and microvascular dysfunction, with catecholamine excess being the predominant theory [5, 6]. There is a catecholamine-induced microvascular spasm resulting in myocardial stunning, or it can cause direct catecholamine-associated myocardial toxicity [7]. It has also been reported that in some patients, the only visible stressor was exposure to catecholamines or beta-agonist drugs occurring in routine clinical doses [8]. Plasma catecholamines were measured at the onset of presentation [2, 9–11], and it was concluded that the plasma norepinephrine levels were elevated in 26 of 34 patients (74%) [2]. Rat models of immobilization-induced stress have also showed increased elevated catecholamines along with reversible LV ballooning [12].Clinically, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy presents similar to acute coronary syndrome, along with elevated cardiac troponin levels in the majority of the cases. BNP or N-terminal pro-BNP has also been found to be elevated in most patients, up to as much as 82.9% as reported in the international Takotsubo Registry [4]. ST segment elevations in the EKG occur mainly in the anterior pericardial leads [13]. Initially, the diastolic function is similar to that of an acute myocardial infarction, but the systolic function can be similar or reduced [14, 15]. Echocardiographic features are predominantly left ventricular dysfunction due to akinesia of the midapical segments of the left ventricle (apical ballooning). Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging shows transient perfusion abnormalities, in the left ventricular apex. Other variants include mid and basal segment akinesia [11]. The in-hospital complication rates are very similar to those of acute coronary syndrome. Cardiogenic shock, invasive and noninvasive ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and death occurred in 19.1% of patients as reported in the Takotsubo Registry versus 19.3% in a control group comprised of patients with acute coronary syndrome [4]. Patients tend to recover the ventricular systolic function within four weeks after the acute episode, with the mean LVEF which increased from 29% at the onset to 63% at an average of 6 days [16].Our hypothesis here is that when our patient had chest pain in the past, she had minor catecholamine-induced myocardial stunning, which went unrecognized due to the early or quick recuperation of myocardial function ahead of the diagnostic imaging. Though a stress test was abnormal at one point, the cardiac catheterization did not show any coronary abnormalities. With that said, the real incidence of stress-induced cardiomyopathy may be higher than the one mentioned above. This will need higher anticipation by the physician and further study with a better use of the Takotsubo Registry.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.Conception, design, and drafting were made by Vishal Dhulipala and Rashika Gottimukkula.

Recurrence of Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction Requiring Alcohol Septal Ablation after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation
1Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan2Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan3Department of Anesthesiology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Hideki Kitahara; moc.liamg@6030.atikedihReceived 19 August 2018; Accepted 29 October 2018; Published 2 December 2018Academic Editor: Antonio de Padua MansurCopyright © 2018 Hideki Kitahara et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is sometimes observed in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). It is still controversial how to manage the remaining severe AS, when LVOT obstruction is well-controlled by medical therapy. We report a case with acute recurrence of LVOT obstruction requiring emergent alcohol septal ablation (ASA) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), even in a stable state on beta-blockers. For the ASA procedure, transesophageal echocardiography was useful to clearly observe the perfusion area of the target septal branch by injecting microbubble contrast. Since it took some time to cause the recurrence of LVOT obstruction in this case, careful evaluation should be done after TAVI in high-risk patients for LVOT obstruction before terminating the TAVI procedure.Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is sometimes observed in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) [1]. If a patient has both conditions, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with septal myectomy or, alternatively, alcohol septal ablation (ASA) followed by transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) should be considered [2, 3]. On the other hand, in cases with improved LVOT obstruction by medical therapy, it is still controversial how to manage the remaining severe AS in high surgical risk or inoperable patients. We report a case with acute recurrence of LVOT obstruction requiring ASA after TAVI.A frail 86-year-old female, presenting with dyspnea on exertion with elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of >900, at high surgical risk (the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score 9.8%), was referred to our institution to consider treatment for severe AS. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed not only severe AS (aortic valve area was 0.58 cm2, and peak velocity was 4.0 m/s) but also diffuse left ventricular hypertrophy except posterior wall (Maron type III hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and LVOT obstruction with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, leading to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). Peak velocity was 2.9 m/s, and mean pressure gradient was 32 mmHg at the LVOT during the Valsalva maneuver. After administration of a beta-blocker (bisoprolol 1.25 mg/day), LVOT obstruction and SAM disappeared, and MR was reduced to mild degree. Since peak velocity across the aortic valve and BNP level were still high, TAVI was planned to treat AS. Coronary angiography confirmed the first major septal branch perfusing the basal septum (Figure 1(a)). Thus, ASA was considered as a rescue option for recurrence of LVOT obstruction.The 23 mm SAPIEN 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) was successfully implanted via transfemoral approach with general anesthesia and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance, under continuous infusion of beta-blocker (landiolol) and volume load. Five minutes after implantation, there was no obvious LVOT obstruction and SAM (Figures 2(d)–2(f)). However, 15 minutes later, TEE clearly showed SAM and severe MR, and pressure gradient was >50 mmHg at the LVOT, even under increased dose of beta-blockers (Figures 2(g)–2(i)). Because the patient’s hemodynamic status became rapidly unstable, we decided to perform emergent ASA. Through a 2 mm over-the-wire balloon, microbubble contrast was injected into the first septal branch to confirm its perfusion area in the septum, which was located on the opposite side of SAM, using TEE (Figure 1(d)). After injecting a total of 3.5 ml absolute alcohol into the septal branch (Figure 1(e)), total occlusion was confirmed by coronary angiography (Figure 1(c)), and the pressure gradient at the LVOT was decreased below 10 mmHg (Figure 1(f)). Final TEE and TTE showed no LVOT obstruction or SAM and reduced MR. After ASA, complete atrioventricular block occurred, and a permanent pacemaker was implanted 3 days later. At 6-month follow-up, TTE showed good bioprosthetic valve function, regional hypokinesis of the basal-mid septum, and no evidence of LVOT obstruction.In patients with severe AS accompanied by LVOT obstruction, SAVR with concomitant septal myectomy should be considered [2]. For high surgical risk or inoperable patients, preceding ASA followed by TAVI may be an alternative strategy [3]. However, LVOT obstruction can often be well-controlled by medical therapy. In our case, because the LVOT obstruction was eliminated with a low-dose beta-blocker, TAVI was performed for the remaining AS. As a result, LVOT obstruction recurred despite sufficient beta-blocker infusion and volume load, as preoperatively concerned. Even in a stable state on beta-blockers, LVOT obstruction can occur, possibly by rapid reduction of left ventricular afterload and accelerated blood flow after TAVI.ASA is a good option to recover from acute deterioration of LVOT obstruction after TAVI, because most patients are at high surgical risk or inoperable [4, 5]. For the ASA procedure, TEE may be useful to clearly observe and confirm the perfusion area of the target septal branch by injecting microbubble contrast, if the patient undergoes TAVI with general anesthesia and TEE guidance. In addition, it is noteworthy that it took some time to cause the recurrence of LVOT obstruction and SAM in this case, although neither were detected immediately after valve implantation. Transient left ventricular dysfunction due to rapid pacing might be one of the reasons for the delayed appearance of LVOT obstruction and SAM after TAVI.LVOT obstruction can recur after TAVI even in a stable state on beta-blockers. ASA with TEE guidance is a good option to recover from acute deterioration of LVOT obstruction after TAVI. Careful observation should be done in high-risk patients for LVOT obstruction before terminating the TAVI procedure.The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Isolated Marked Inferior Vena Cava Dilatation: Unusual Presentation or Underrecognized Common Phenomenon?
1Department of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA2Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Younghoon Kwon; ude.ainigriv.ccm.liamcsh@j2kyReceived 29 July 2018; Accepted 2 October 2018; Published 29 November 2018Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2018 Sneha R. Gadi et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and respirophasic variation are commonly used echocardiographic indices to estimate right atrial pressure. While dilatation of the IVC and reduced collapsibility have traditionally been associated with elevated right heart filling pressures, the significance of isolated IVC dilatation in the absence of raised filling pressures remains poorly understood. We present a case of an asymptomatic 28-year-old male incidentally found to have IVC dilatation, reduced inspiratory collapse, and normal right heart pressures.The use of echocardiogram for the assessment of inferior vena cava (IVC) size and right atrial (RA) pressure estimation dates back several decades and has undergone extensive analysis [1–5]. Current American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) recommendations [6] state that IVC diameter ≤ 2.1 cm that collapses >50% with a sniff suggests normal RA pressure (RAP, range 0–5 mmHg), whereas IVC diameter > 2.1 cm that collapses <50% suggests high RAP (range 10–20 mmHg). We report the case of an asymptomatic, previously healthy, 28-year-old male recently diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B who was incidentally found to have a dilated IVC with reduced inspiratory collapse but with normal RAP by right heart catheterization (RHC).A 28-year-old male was referred to our cardiology clinic for evaluation of a dilated IVC incidentally noted on liver ultrasound. The patient had recently been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B on screening lab studies done at the local health department. The patient was asymptomatic and had no other chronic medical conditions. His social history was pertinent for multiple same-sex partners. A screening HIV test was negative. He had no family history of heart disease. As part of hepatitis work-up, the patient underwent liver ultrasound, which revealed dilated IVC and hepatic veins (Figure 1). Liver biopsy showed evidence of chronic hepatitis but no elements of cirrhosis. He was subsequently referred to cardiology for further evaluation due to concern for elevated right-sided heart pressures. Vital signs were unremarkable with blood pressure 106/62 mmHg and a pulse of 52. He had normal body habitus (body mass index of 25.8 kg/m2). His physical exam showed no evidence of jugular venous distention, lower extremity edema, or abdominal distention, and his cardiac exam revealed regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with normal axis, no conduction delays, and no repolarization abnormalities. Labs were pertinent for AST/ALT elevations to 200 s but normal renal function and normal brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level. The patient subsequently underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram. This showed mildly enlarged biventricular cavity (LVIDd 6.0 cm, basal RVIDd 4.50 cm) with normal systolic function (LVEF 55–60%, TAPSE 3.10 cm, TV S 13.0 cm/sec, and RV fractional area change of 47%) and normal diastolic function (MV E velocity 82.56 cm/s, MV A velocity 39.53 cm/s, MV E/A 2.09, MV e septal 15.00 cm/s, MV e lateral 16.00 cm/s, E/E ratio 5.42, estimated PASP 34, and LA volume index 41.31 mL/m2). There were no significant valvular abnormalities except mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. RA was normal in size. The IVC diameter was increased at 2.7–3.0 cm and demonstrated <50% collapse with inspiration (Figures 2(a) and 2(b): 2D and M-mode images with markings). Dilated hepatic vein was again demonstrated, and the Doppler-based hepatic vein flow pattern showed slightly greater diastolic velocity (Vd) than systolic velocity (Vs) (Figure 3). There was no narrowing of the IVC suggestive of external compression. Given these abnormal findings suggestive of increased RAP despite an otherwise healthy young male without signs of heart failure, a RHC was performed. Hemodynamics were found to be within normal limits: mean RAP of 8 mmHg, mean pulmonary artery pressure of 19 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 12 mmHg, and thermodilutional/Fick CI of 3.31/2.82 L/min/m2, respectively.The use of echocardiography in the noninvasive estimation of cardiac hemodynamics, particularly in relation to RAP, has undergone significant progress since first used several decades ago. Natori et al. [1] in 1979 were the first to describe the sonographic relationship of IVC size and respirophasic variation of IVC. Many studies have since shown good overall correlation between these IVC indices and RAP [2–5]. Brennan et al. [4] derived optimal cutoff values using receiver operating characteristic analysis from patients undergoing RHC and echocardiographic assessment of IVC. They found that IVC size greater than 2.0 cm and collapsibility less than 40% yielded excellent negative predictive value (90% for both) but comparatively low positive predictive value (62% for both) in predicting an elevated RAP (>10 mmHg). A different study performed by Lee et al. [7], conducted among Japanese population, reported lower optimal cutoff values (IVC size 19 mm and collapsibility 30%). Similar to the study by Brennan et al., these cutoff values yielded high negative predictive values (98% for both IVC size and collapsibility) but low positive predictive values (17% for IVC size and 20% for IVC collapsibility). Thus, one can argue that our patient’s findings may simply represent a false positive echocardiographic finding of abnormal IVC index in the setting of normal RAP. However, the marked degree of dilatation of the IVC (3.1 cm) with normal RAP is rather unusual. Additionally, high RAP was suspected based on hepatic vein enlargement and abnormal hepatic vein flow pattern (i.e., systolic flow velocity (Vs)/diastolic flow velocity (Vd) < 1 (predominant diastolic)). Despite this, no evidence of high RAP was found on RHC.There are some reported cases of IVC enlargement in the setting of normal RAP, including highly trained athletes, patients with large body-surface area, young adults with history of vasovagal syncope, those on mechanical ventilation, or those with structural causes such as narrowing of the IVC-RA junction, web or tissue present in the IVC, or prominent Eustachian valve [5, 8, 9]. Our patient did not have any of these above conditions. In one of these studies, Kim et al. [8] described a case of isolated IVC dilatation in which the authors reported “normal” RAP in the setting of abnormal echocardiographic IVC index (dilated IVC (2.4 cm) with reduced collapsibility). However, they reported the mean RAP of 13 mmHg, which is considered high. Other reports describe idiopathic dilatation of the IVC in three young patients with otherwise normal echocardiographic findings. However, RHC was not obtained in these cases. It is also important to note that although IVC indices can be indicative of elevated RAP, the strength of the association remains uncertain.The implication of isolated dilated IVC with reduced collapsibility, especially to the degree seen in our patient, in the absence of previously established causes, is unclear. Patients included in the previously mentioned investigations, including the two largest aforementioned studies [4, 7], had much smaller IVC size distribution. For example, Brennan et al. [4] reported a mean maximum IVC diameter of 1.8 cm (SD: 0.5), and Lee et al. [7] reported a mean IVC maximum diameter of 1.6 cm (SD: 0.5), implying that those with much higher IVC diameters such as greater than 2 or 3 cm were not included in the study. As such, the positive predictive value for those with extreme IVC size is unknown and may be higher than what has been reported. While isolated abnormal IVC index may simply point to decrease in the abdominal IVC tone [9] or reduced IVC compliance in the absence of elevated RAP, confirmation by RHC may be necessary in certain clinical context. In our case, this was pursued partly due to mildly enlarged biventricular cavities of unclear etiology.This case highlights the existing knowledge gap in our understanding of the IVC in relation to RAP. We suspect such illustrated false positive echocardiographic findings of high RAP may not be uncommon but underrecognized in real-world settings. Existing body of knowledge about IVC-RAP relationship comes solely from biased population who underwent RHC for clinical indication. To our knowledge, no data from a community cohort exist, which is understandable considering that invasive RHC correlation in a healthy population would not be typically justified.We present a patient with unknown etiology of marked IVC dilation and attenuated IVC collapsibility without elevated RAP. Prevalence and prognostic implications of such finding warrant further investigations.Learning Objective. Echocardiographic findings of IVC dilatation with reduced collapsibility have traditionally been associated with elevated right atrial pressure. However, there exist cases in which these IVC indices are actually found in conjunction with normal right heart pressures. Given the absence of studies on normal community cohorts, it is possible that such false positive estimations of right atrial pressure may not be uncommon but simply underrecognized in real-world settings.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.
Pulmonary Hemodynamic Changes with Nitric Oxide or Oxygen in a Patient with Asplenia, Single Right Ventricle, and Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection after Fontan Procedure
Department of Pediatrics, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa 078-8510, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Hideharu Oka; pj.ca.dem-awakihasa@p5akoReceived 25 July 2018; Revised 9 October 2018; Accepted 31 October 2018; Published 25 November 2018Academic Editor: Adam TorbickiCopyright © 2018 Hideharu Oka et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Asplenia syndrome is frequently complicated by a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. Pulmonary venous obstruction, following total anomalous pulmonary venous connection surgery, is one of the risk factors for morbidity and mortality. In some patients, the pulmonary vasculature is abnormal even in the absence of clinical evidence of pulmonary venous obstruction. We hypothesized that a change in the pulmonary hemodynamics could indicate the abnormality of pulmonary vein in a patient with asplenia, single right ventricle, and total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, following Fontan procedure. Here, we present a case of asplenia, single right ventricle, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and right pulmonary venous obstruction in which evidence of a potential left pulmonary venous obstruction was obtained following the administration of inhaled nitric oxide and oxygen.Asplenia syndrome is frequently complicated by total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC). Pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO), following TAPVC surgery, is one of the risk factors for morbidity and mortality. The indexed pulmonary vein sum is smaller in patients with asplenia syndrome than in those without. Furthermore, patients with asplenia syndrome have a thin-walled pulmonary vein [1–3]. The atrial wall is thick, and a direct anastomosis between the atrial wall and the thin-walled pulmonary venous confluence is not particularly desirable [4]. The pathology of PVO after TAPVC repair is indicated by vessels exhibiting fibrous intimal layer hyperplasia associated with some medial layer hypertrophy [5]. In some patients, the intimal hyperplasia involves the pulmonary vein ostia without anastomotic stenosis [6]. Furthermore, in patients with single ventricle and TAPVC, the pulmonary vasculature is abnormal, even in the absence of clinical evidence of PVO [7]. Hence, in a patient with asplenia, single ventricle, and TAPVC, the abnormality of pulmonary vein might occurs easily. Following Fontan procedure, the abnormality of pulmonary vein may have an influence over a patient’s hemodynamic parameters. However, it has previously been difficult to diagnose the abnormality of pulmonary vein during a patient’s lifetime. We hypothesized that a change in the pulmonary hemodynamics could indicate the abnormality of pulmonary vein. Here, we present a case of asplenia, single right ventricle, TAPVC, and right lower PVO after Fontan procedure, in which evidence of the abnormality of the left pulmonary vein was demonstrated based on the measurements of hemodynamic parameters and responsiveness to inhaled nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen.A 4-year-old girl was previously diagnosed with asplenia, single right ventricle, and supracardiac TAPVC. She underwent pulmonary artery banding at the age of 1 month, followed by a bidirectional Glenn procedure and TAPVC repair at the age of 5 months. She did not demonstrate symptoms of PVO, and there was no evidence of delay in the excretion of contrast media in cardiac catheter examination before Fontan procedure. Extracardiac Fontan palliation was subsequently performed at the age of 19 months. At the age of 3 years, although right lower PVO occurred because of the compression of the vertebra, she did not demonstrate symptoms of PVO (Figure 1). At the age of 4 years, she underwent a cardiac catheterization to evaluate her hemodynamic parameters after Fontan procedure (Table 1). She was taking oral aspirin, warfarin, and enalapril. After a routine hemodynamic assessment, NO and oxygen tests were performed. A pigtail catheter was placed in the single ventricle, and a wedge catheter was positioned in the pulmonary artery. We performed the pulmonary vasodilator examination in the same way as when doing the examination in patients with pulmonary hypertension [8]. Subsequently, 20 ppm NO was administered via face mask. After 5 minutes of NO administration, her hemodynamic parameters were measured. Following a washout period of 5 minutes, 100% oxygen was administered, and after 5 minutes of oxygen administration, her hemodynamic parameters were again measured. To measure the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure accurately, the waveform was monitored carefully (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). After the administration of NO, the single-ventricle end-diastolic pressure, bilateral mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and cardiac index did not change. Oxygen saturation did not change at 95%, and pulmonary resistance index decreased from 2.1 to 1.0 Um2. However, the right lower pulmonary arterial wedge pressure increased from 8 to 12 mmHg, and the left lower pulmonary arterial wedge pressure increased from 7 to 9 mmHg. The cardiac index remained almost the same. Similarly, following the administration of oxygen, the single-ventricle end-diastolic pressure did not change; however, the right lower pulmonary arterial wedge pressure increased from 8 to 14 mmHg and the left lower pulmonary arterial wedge pressure increased from 7 to 12 mmHg. The bilateral mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased from 13 to 15 mmHg. Although angiography was performed after the inhalation of NO and oxygen, there was no evidence of left pulmonary venous obstruction or delay in the excretion of contrast media (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). A systemic-to-pulmonary shunt was also nonexistent. On echocardiography, there was no acceleration of blood flow at the left pulmonary vein or surgical anastomosis between the pulmonary venous confluence and the atrium. There was also no stenosis of the atrioventricular valve. Despite the inhalation of NO and oxygen, there was no acceleration of blood flow, and stenosis was not identified at the surgical anastomosis between the pulmonary venous confluence and the atrium (Figure 4).We administrated inhaled NO and oxygen in a patient with asplenia, single right ventricle, TAPVC, and right lower PVO after Fontan procedure and noted the changes in her hemodynamic parameters. The reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance is useful for hemodynamics in a patient with Fontan procedure. But it is unknown whether the effect of NO or oxygen is valid or not in a patient with Fontan procedure having pulmonary venous abnormality. If the single-ventricle end-diastolic pressure increases, the cause of increasing pulmonary arterial wedge pressure is considered to be single-ventricle dysfunction. However, because single-ventricle end-diastolic pressure did not increase in the present case, the increasing pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure were attributed to either a stenosis at the surgical anastomosis or a PVO. Our patient did not exhibit signs of stenosis at the surgical anastomosis between the pulmonary venous confluence and the atrium on echocardiography. Although there was evidence of right lower pulmonary venous obstruction, our patient did not recognize the left lower PVO. Even if pulmonary blood flow was limited owing to the right lower pulmonary venous obstruction, there was no change in the pulmonary arterial pressure as the blood passed through other normal pulmonary veins. The pulmonary arterial wedge pressure also does not increase because the pulmonary blood flow is accommodated by other pulmonary blood vessels, as long as the other vessels are devoid of any abnormalities. Hence, the pathology of increasing pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure in our patient was postulated to be associated with the abnormality of the left pulmonary vein. We supposed that the postcapillary levels of the pulmonary veins would have been obstructed in this case because the stenosis at the surgical anastomosis and accelerated blood flow of pulmonary veins were not detected. The condition of PVO after TAPVC repair results from the development of fibrous hyperplasia of the intimal layer of the vessel, associated with some hypertrophy of the medial layer [5]. Pulmonary vasculature is abnormal even in the absence of clinical evidence of PVO in patients with single ventricle and TAPVC [7]. Hence, in a patient with asplenia, single ventricle, and TAPVC, the abnormality of pulmonary vein may occur easily. In such patients, other pulmonary blood vessels may not be able to compensate for the increase in pulmonary blood flow by an expansion of the pulmonary artery at the level of the precapillary venules. This leads to an increase in the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure and is an important condition in patients undergoing Fontan procedure. Central venous pressure is an important hemodynamic parameter in patients undergoing this procedure, and it depends on the pulmonary arterial pressure. Dilatation of the pulmonary artery is one approach to establish good Fontan circulation. In fact, many studies have discussed the effectiveness of pulmonary vasodilators in the establishment of good Fontan circulation. Aggressive use of combination pulmonary vasodilator therapy is occasionally recommended to achieve good Fontan circulation [9]. However, in patients with the abnormality of pulmonary vein, expanding the pulmonary artery may promote pulmonary congestion and therefore may not allow the establishment of good Fontan circulation. We would like to examine these types of patients who have an abnormality of the pulmonary vein in the future. Our opinion is that a patient with asplenia and TAPVC after Fontan procedure should be considered carefully.In conclusion, we found evidence of an abnormality of the pulmonary vein following the administration of inhaled NO and oxygen in an asymptomatic patient with asplenia, single right ventricle, TAPVC, and right lower PVO after Fontan procedure. Our findings suggest that in patients with asplenia and TAPVC, there may be a possibility of developing PVO.The family of the patient described provided their informed consent for the study of the child.Masaya Sugimoto’s present affiliation is at Sugimoto Pediatric Clinic, Asahikawa 079-8417, Japan.The authors have no conflicts of interest.
Hemopericardium and Cardiac Tamponade Secondary to Migrated Inferior Vena Cava Filter

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 73-year-old female presented with cardiogenic shock secondary to hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade. Imaging revealed two fractured legs of an inferior vena cava filter, with one leg within the anterior myocardium of the right ventricle and another penetrating the inferior septum through the middle cardiac vein. Hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade were treated with pericardiocentesis. A multidisciplinary meeting resulted in deferring further action against the embedded fractured legs of the filter with consideration of the patient’s age and comorbidities. This case report should alert clinicians to think about hemopericardium as a cause of cardiac tamponade and cardiogenic shock in a patient with a history of an inferior vena cava filter placement.Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are commonly placed in an effort to prevent pulmonary embolism. The only accepted indication for placement of a vena cava filter is for patients who have venous thromboembolism and an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation [1]. There are important, well-known complications of filter placement, such as bleeding, infection, and access site complications including hematoma or arteriovenous fistula. Long-term complications include filter protrusion resulting in perforation of the IVC or surrounding organs and filter fracture and/or embolization. There is limited data regarding the safety and efficacy of the various filter types. The PRESERVE (predicting the safety and effectiveness of inferior vena cava filters) trial was initiated in 2014 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of six different IVC filters over long term.We present a case of an elderly female who was admitted from a nursing home for acute seizure activity and acute hemodynamic instability found to be secondary to hemopericardium resulting in cardiac tamponade.A 73-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic pancreatitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, seizure disorder, and pulmonary embolism (PE) presented to an outside hospital after a reported seizure at her nursing home. Emergency medical services were called at the nursing home and the patient was reportedly hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the 70s on room air with subsequent development of agitation and lethargy after the seizure. The patient was transferred to an outside hospital’s emergency department (ED), where additional tonic-clonic activity was noted. She subsequently developed hypotension with a blood pressure of 52/36 mmHg that was refractory to crystalloid intravenous fluid resuscitation. Central venous catheter (CVC) was placed and norepinephrine was started for persistent hypotension. Labs were notable for leukocytosis, troponin elevation, and low mixed venous saturation on CVC venous blood gas. The patient was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care facility cardiac intensive care unit for evaluation of cardiogenic shock.Upon arrival, the patient was alert and following commands, but disoriented. She was still requiring supplemental oxygen and norepinephrine for hypotension. Given the concern for cardiogenic shock, a stat bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained, which demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. The patient was urgently taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for pericardiocentesis with a drain placement. This yielded 580 ml of hemorrhagic fluid with rapid improvement in hemodynamics following drainage. During the pericardiocentesis, fluoroscopy demonstrated two embolized fragments of the IVC filter within the right ventricle (RV). Review of past imaging revealed that the embolized fragment was visualized on computer tomography (CT) of the chest one year and one month prior to presentation. Upon further investigation from family, it was discovered that the patient’s Bard G2 retrievable IVC filter was placed in April 2007 in the context of a PE with concurrent GI bleed. Pericardial fluid culture was negative, and cytology and fluid analysis were consistent with hemopericardium as cause of the pericardial effusion.Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted due to the embolized fractured IVC filter. Surgery recommended cardiac CT angiogram (CTA) for further visualization of the fragment. Cardiac CTA demonstrated two fractured legs of the IVC filter, with one leg within the anterior myocardium of the RV and another penetrating the inferior septum through the middle cardiac vein (Figure 1). 3-D reconstruction of the RV further visualized the two legs of the embolized IVC filter (Figure 2). Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram one day after the pericardiocentesis revealed no reaccumulation of the pericardial effusion and the pericardial drain was successfully removed. A multidisciplinary team discussion took place with the family who elected to defer surgical removal of the IVC filter unless pericardial effusion reaccumulated due to the patient’s comorbidities and age. She was discharged to her assisted living facility, and continues to do well at the time of this report.Although IVC filters offer an effective means of preventing pulmonary embolism in a population where anticoagulation is contraindicated, despite improved filters and insertion techniques, complications still occur. The major risks associated with the placement of an IVC filter include pneumothorax, hemorrhage, filter misplacement, and vessel injury [2]. Migration and/or embolization of a fractured IVC filter remains one of the late rare, but potentially lethal complications. Filter migration has a reported incidence of 3% to 12%. Complete filter displacement with migration to the heart is even more rare, ranging from 0.1% to 1.2% of the cases, with a variable prevalence depending on the filter type [2, 3]. Several factors have been recognized for IVC filter dislodgement and fracture, including technical errors, equipment malfunction, mega cava or an increase in IVC diameter from Valsalva maneuvers, poor alignment of the filter with the IVC, J-wire entrapment during central line placement, and thrombus pushing the filter proximally [4, 5].Filter fractures are more common with retrievable filters, with the highest to lowest incidence in the following order: Bard G2, Cook Celect, Bard Recovery, Bard Eclipse, Cook Günther, Bard Meridian, Bard G2X, Bard Option, and OptEase filter. The most common location of a fractured fragment is the IVC wall and pulmonary artery, followed by the spine and heart. The Bard Recovery, Bard G2, and Cook Celect have the highest incidence of embolized filter fragments to the heart [5]. Our patient’s Bard G2 filter has a five-year fracture prevalence of 38% [6, 7]. Intravascular filter fragments can be removed safely with success rates that vary according to location. In a study by Trerotola and Stavropoulos, 90% (43 of 48) of filters were retrieved from the IVC, 50% (three of six) from the heart, and 71% (17 of 24) from the pulmonary arteries. Because of extravascular fragment location and/or retrieval failure, only 50% of the patients were recognized to be fragment free [8].One of the major ways to prevent this lethal complication is by focusing on early retrieval of the filter once protection from PE is no longer needed. Other indications for removal include locally retained intravascular fragment (within the IVC) as it poses a risk for central embolization and/or thrombus formation and in any of the patients who are symptomatic on a case-by-case basis after carefully weighing the risk-benefit ratio. By 2010, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received 921 reports of adverse events with IVC filters: of these reports, 328 involved device migration, 146 involved embolizations (detachment of device components), 70 involved perforation of the IVC, and 56 involved filter fracture [9]. The Bard G2 filter was taken off the market in 2010. In 2013, the Bard Denali filter was approved by the FDA to replace the Recovery, G2, G2 Express, Eclipse, and Meridian filters in the hopes of having a better-designed and long-term performance filter with fewer complications [6].In conclusion, the ideal IVC filter design is evolving and remains unknown. Based on current literature, the fragments from fractured filters, when intravascular, can be successfully removed by using percutaneous interventional techniques in a large percentage of patients, but the success rate varies according to fragment location. For the extravascular fragments, however, only approximately half of the patients are rendered fragment free and extraction should be discussed on a case-by-case basis. In each case, it is important to remember that timely follow-up and early retrieval of the filter will help prevent long-term complications. Until the PRESERVE trial provides long-term data on safety and efficacy of the IVC filters (ALN, Option Elite Retrievable, VenaTech LP, Cook Günther Tulip, Bard DENALI, and Cordis OptEase Retrievable vena cava filter), case reports like these should alert clinicians to think about hemopericardium as a cause of cardiac tamponade and cardiogenic shock in a patient with a history of an IVC filter placement.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
A Unique Case of Midvariant Reverse Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy
Maricopa Integrated Health System, 2601 E Roosevelt St, Phoenix, AZ 85008, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Carmel Moazez; moc.liamg@zezaomcReceived 4 August 2018; Accepted 8 October 2018; Published 21 November 2018Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2018 Carmel Moazez et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy, is known to have 4 variants: apical, midventricular, basal, and focal. Here, we report the 2nd case of reverse midvariant (midventricular) stress cardiomyopathy and the 1st case of reverse midvariant takotsubo cardiomyopathy with apical thrombus.Stress cardiomyopathy (takotsubo cardiomyopathy), also known as the broken heart syndrome, is a cardiomyopathy which is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of any coronary artery stenosis. It was first discovered in 1990 by a Japanese cardiologist [1]. Takotsubo is a Japanese word that means a pot with a narrow neck and round bottom that is used to catch octopus [2]. This cardiomyopathy usually occurs in postmenopausal women who undergo severe emotional or physical distress [3].There are various phenotypes of this syndrome: apical type, basal type (reverse type), midventricular type, and rarely focal type. Here, we report another rare form of stress cardiomyopathy described as reverse midvariant. In this form of stress cardiomyopathy, the mid-left ventricle is hyperdynamic and the apex and the base of the heart are akinetic or hypokinetic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 2nd case of reverse midvariant stress cardiomyopathy and the 1st case of reverse midvariant cardiomyopathy with apical thrombus reported and described in the literature [4].This is a case of a 59-year-old female with a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prior stress cardiomyopathy with normal coronaries on left heart catheterization and hypertension who presented to the emergency department after being found down by a neighbor. Electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission was significant for sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 104 beats per minute (bpm) with premature atrial complexes, biatrial enlargement, right axis deviation, and prolonged QT interval. Four minutes later another electrocardiogram was done which showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate with a heart rate of 147 bpm and prolonged QT. She was given one dose of IV 5 mg metoprolol and given an amiodarone bolus of 150 mg and started on an amiodarone drip. In light of a CHADSVASC score of 4, she was also started on a heparin drip. Troponin I on admission was found to be 9 ng/ml (normal 0–0.03). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit.During this hospitalization her troponin I trended down to 1.5 ng/ml (normal 0–0.03). She had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed left ventricular ejection fraction 55% (low normal) and a left ventricle apical thrombus measuring 0.95 × 0.7 cm which can be seen in Figure 1. There were also regional wall motion abnormalities which included hypokinetic to akinetic basal myocardial segments, akinetic apex, and hyperdynamic midventricular segments which can be visualized in Figures 2–4. These findings were consistent with reverse midvariant takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was discharged on aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and apixaban after 7 days in the hospital. The patient was lost to follow up.This case describes a rare form of stress cardiomyopathy called reverse midvariant. This phenotype of stress cardiomyopathy can be easily recognized by its unique pattern of hyperdynamic midventricle and akinetic or hypokinetic basal and apical segments. The first reported case of reverse midvariant takotsubo cardiomyopathy was reported in 2016 by Bridgman and Chan. They reported a case of a 79-year-old female who presented with chest pain, elevated troponin I, and a prolonged QT interval with T wave inversion. Echocardiogram was done which showed reverse midvariant takotsubo cardiomyopathy [4]. Our case is unique in that our patient presented with this rare form of stress cardiomyopathy and that her cardiomyopathy was complicated by an apical thrombus.The pathogenesis of stress cardiomyopathy is unknown. Usually left ventricular dysfunction is transient in stress cardiomyopathy, and many cases have even recovered within a few days [1, 2]. Many experts believe that the catecholamine surge plays a role in wall akinesis. Wittstein et al. showed that patients who presented with takotsubo cardiomyopathy had a two- to threefold increase in catecholamine levels compared with patients who presented with myocardial infarction [5].Multiple studies have shown the incidence of apical thrombus in takotsubo cardiomyopathy to be between 5–10% [6–8]. Left ventricular thrombi are thought to form during the acute phase of stress cardiomyopathy due to LV akinesis which causes blood stasis and increased catecholamine levels which leads to endothelial injury and hypercoagulable state [6]. Similar to the apical variant of stress cardiomyopathy, this form can also be complicated by apical thrombus as shown in our case. Another possibility is that our patient has been in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which manifested this hospitalization and the reason for thrombus formation.Unfortunately, this patient did not follow up and there were no interim echocardiograms in between acute episodes of stress cardiomyopathy to evaluate left ventricular function. The patient reported compliance with medical therapy with beta blocker and ace inhibitor. The etiology of recurrent and or persistent stress cardiomyopathy in this patient remained unclear. Given recent left heart catheterization and findings of nonobstructed coronaries, the decision was made to not pursue another angiogram.We conclude that the reverse midvariant type of stress cardiomyopathy should be added to the existing four forms.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Video 1: apical 2 chamber view with agitated saline showing basal and apical ballooning with preserved contractility of the midventricular segments.

A Case of an Obstructive Intramural Haematoma during Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Successfully Treated with Intima Microfenestrations Utilising a Cutting Balloon Inflation Technique

Kalogeropoulos; moc.liamg@golakdnaReceived 12 August 2018; Revised 29 September 2018; Accepted 24 October 2018; Published 19 November 2018Academic Editor: Kuan-Rau ChiouCopyright © 2018 Osama Alsanjari et al.

During PCI, inadvertent vessel tearing can occur, resulting in coronary dissections and formation of intramural haematomas. The latter might be associated with compression of the vessel lumen and significant compromise of the coronary blood flow leading to myocardial ischaemia and infarction. Herein, we present a case of intramural haematoma that occurred after PCI of the left anterior descending artery resulting in occlusion of the vessel and the subsequent use of a cutting balloon inflation technique to resolve the haematoma and restore the normal coronary blood flow.Appropriate lumen enlargement with balloon predilatation is an essential part of successful stent deployment and adequate expansion during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) [1, 2]. Plaque fracture with dissection of the arterial wall after balloon predilatation is considered a key component of this process. However, during subsequent stent deployment, inadvertent vessel tearing may also occur at the transition point between the rigid stent struts and the adjacent arterial wall [3]. This injury can have various manifestations from innocuous small edge dissections to intramural haematomas. The latter form is defined as blood accumulation in the medial space with displacement of the internal elastic membrane inward and the external elastic membrane outward with or without identifiable entry or exit point [4]. Post-PCI intramural haematomas can cause extensive compression of the true lumen of the vessel, resulting in myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction [5]. Bailout treatment of intramural haematomas through further stenting, reentry with a stiff chronic total occlusion- (CTO-) dedicated guidewire, or microfenestrations with cutting or scoring balloons has been previously described [6–12]. However, there is still no consensus regarding the optimal treatment strategy. Herein, we present a case of a flow-limiting intramural coronary haematoma following PCI that was successfully treated with microfenestrations of the intima layer, utilising a cutting balloon inflation technique.A 70-year-old man transferred to our institution with a 24-hour history of intermittent central chest pain and evidence of inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on the twelve-lead electrocardiogram. He was an ex-smoker with a history of 10 pack-years without any significant past medical history and not on any regular medications.Given his symptoms and the associated ECG findings, he was transferred to the catheterisation laboratory and an emergency coronary angiography was performed via the right radial artery access route using a 6Fr arterial sheath. The left main (LMS) and the right coronary artery (RCA) were engaged with a 5f Judkins left (JL) 3.5 diagnostic catheter and a 6f Judkins right (JR) 4.0 guiding catheter, respectively. The left coronary system revealed a patent LMS, a tubular moderate to severe stenosis extending from the proximal to the mid segment of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) (Figure 1(a)), and a minor nonobstructive atheroma in a nondominant left circumflex artery (LCx). The RCA was acutely occluded. We proceeded to primary PCI of the RCA. Using the 6Fr JR4 guiding catheter, a Sion Blue guide wire (Asahi INTECC Co., Ltd.) was passed through the occluded segment into the distal vessel. Predilatation was then performed with a 2.5 mm Trek, semicompliant, balloon (Abbott Vascular) with immediate restoration of TIMI 3 flow. This revealed a critical mid vessel stenosis, which was subsequently stented with an Orsiro (BIOTRONIK) 3.5 × 30 mm drug eluting stent (DES), deployed at 12 atmospheres and postdilated with a 3.75 × 20 mm Accuforce (Terumo) noncompliant (NC) balloon inflated to 20 atmospheres with an excellent final angiographic result.In light of the significant bystander disease, we elected to treat the proximal-mid LAD stenosis during the index procedure. Using a 6Fr EBU 3.5 guiding catheter, the lesion was crossed with a Sion Blue guide wire and predilatation was performed with a Trek (Abbott Vascular), 2.5 × 20 mm, semicompliant balloon followed by a 3.0 × 20 mm Accuforce (Terumo) NC balloon at 12 atmospheres. Following predilatation, we could easily identify an intima flap within the stenotic lesion (Figure 1(b)). Aiming to cover the dissection flap, we deployed a 2.75 × 26 mm Orsiro (BIOTRONIK) DES at the mid segment, which was overlapped proximally with a 3.5 × 20 mm Orsiro (BIOTRONIK) DES. The overlapping part of the stents was then postdilated with the 3.5 mm stent balloon at 16 atmospheres. The succeeding cine-acquisition demonstrated a significant luminal stenosis at the outflow of the distal stent (Figure 2(a)), associated with new dynamic anterior ST elevation on the ECG and chest discomfort of the patient. The administration of two consecutive bolus 300 mcg of intracoronary nitrates failed to resolve stenosis and restore normal blood flow, a finding in keeping more likely with a plausible iatrogenic intramural haematoma rather than a coronary spasm. As the patient was clinically unstable and rapidly deteriorating, we initially opted not to perform further assessment with an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and quickly treat the haematoma with an additional stent implantation, but after deploying a 2.5 × 18 mm Orsiro (BIOTRONIK) DES, the subintimal haematoma was propagated more distally with further subtotal occlusion of the vessel (Figure 2(b)). At this stage, we selected to treat the haematoma with a cutting balloon inflation technique, intending to create multiple microfenestrations and relieve the excess inner luminal pressure caused by the haematoma. First, a 2.5 × 6 mm Flextome (Boston Scientific) cutting balloon was successfully delivered at the outflow of the distal stent. Then, we inflated the balloon at nominal pressure, exactly at the transition point between the distal edge of the stent and the adjacent unstented vessel wall (Figure 3(a)). Successive angiography demonstrated complete resolution of the luminal stenosis with complete restoration of TIMI 3 flow (Figure 3(b)). The patient’s troponin level from a blood sample taken on admission was 4528.00 ng/L (normal range 0–14 ng/L), and an echocardiogram two days after his index procedure showed preserved left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55–60% and regional wall motion abnormalities involving hypokinesia of the basal to mid-inferior and inferolateral wall segments. The rest of the myocardial segments had normal contractility. The patient had further follow-up in the outpatient cardiology clinic 3 months later, where he reported an excellent recovery and denied any recurrent symptoms. Additional follow-up has been scheduled for one year after his successful PCI and myocardial infarction.Subintimal haematoma is a well-recognised complication after PCI. It is defined as blood accumulation in the medial space with displacement of the internal elastic membrane inward and the external elastic membrane outward with or without distinguishable entry or exit points, and its diagnosis is confirmed with the utilisation of intravascular imaging modalities, such as the IVUS and optical coherence tomography (OCT) [4]. A previous observational IVUS study, in an unrestricted cohort of patients including 1025 subjects, demonstrated an overall incidence of 6.7%. Furthermore, 60% of the detected haematomas had an angiographic appearance of an intimal dissection flap, and in 29% of those, no significant angiographic abnormality was identified [5]. The underlying mechanism of dissection and subsequent intramural haematoma is multifaceted. Previous pathological findings indicate that an intramural haematoma begins as a dissection to the media and propagates along the medial plane into more normal arterial segments but does not reenter the lumen. After stent implantation, the dissection usually occurs at the edge of the stent, at the transition point between the rigid struts and the nearby unstented reference segment. Once medial dissection occurs, haematoma formation and expansion seem to require a normal arc of arterial wall, whilst a scarred diseased media behind an atherosclerotic plaque area may prevent the propagation of the dissection [5]. A previous observational study of post-PCI edge dissections involving OCT morphometric analysis has shown that a stent landing zone involving an area with significant plaque burden can increase the risk of stent edge dissection by more than 6 times. In addition, circumferential calcium angle, fibrous cap thickness, and vessel overstretching were also independent predictors for the occurrence of edge dissections [13]. In this study, 10% of the edge dissections were associated with the formation of subintimal haematoma [13].Although it is a rare PCI complication, intramural haematoma can be associated with a pressure-driven enlargement of the medial space with vessel lumen compression resulting in significant blood flow disturbances and ischaemia. Prompt recognition and immediate treatment in this context are paramount in order to restore the normal coronary blood flow and resolve ischaemia. As it may prove challenging to recognise the haematoma by angiography alone, intravascular imaging with OCT and IVUS can help to delineate the relevant anatomy and confirm the diagnosis [14]. By IVUS, an intramural haematoma appears as a homogeneous, hyperechoic, crescent-shaped area. The echogenicity of the blood depends on the flow rate, red cell aggregation, and fibrin contents [5]. In the OCT, the intramural haematoma appears as a low-signal area with low light attenuation usually located at the level of the media tunica and demarcated externally by the adventitia [13]. However, forceful injection of contrast media that usually encompasses OCT imaging can increase the risk of further expansion of the medial dissection with more distal propagation of the haematoma. In our case, we opted not to perform an IVUS or OCT as the patient was rapidly deteriorated with profound symptoms of chest pain and dynamic ECG changes. In addition, the constellation of angiographic findings and the ineffective administration of intracoronary nitrates were highly suggestive of intramural haematoma diagnosis.So far, the management of post-PCI intramural haematoma remains controversial and there is no general consensus on optimal therapeutic strategy. Previously published reports have highlighted the role of further stenting, reentry with a stiff CTO guide wire, and also intimal fenestrations with either a cutting or a scoring balloon [6–12]. Treatment with an additional stent embraces an additional risk of further propagating the haematoma more distally, as this was evidently shown in our case. In addition, the use of a stiff guide wire might prove difficult as the manipulation of the wire usually requires expert skills and might also be time consuming. In our case, we applied an elegant and practical technique to treat the haematoma involving the creation of intima microfenestrations by using a cutting balloon. We chose a balloon-artery size ratio of 1 : 1 and specifically aimed to inflate the balloon at the site of the distal edge of the stent and only on nominal pressure to minimise the extent and degree of arterial wall injury. The rationale of this technique is that the blades of the balloon would easily create microfenestrations and reentry points at the intima that will eventually allow the intramural blood to exit and induce decompression of the medial space with successive resolution of the luminal stenosis (Figure 4). In addition, minimal vessel trauma will ensure smooth healing of the vessel wall without the need for further stent deployment and increased odds for optimal long-term outcomes without major adverse coronary events. In a previous case report of a spontaneous left main coronary artery dissection, treatment with stents resulted in propagation of the intramural haematoma with subsequent compromise of coronary blood flow that was successfully dealt with a cutting balloon inflation, subsequent resolution of the haematoma, and restoration of coronary blood flow. The patient had an excellent recovery and remained asymptomatic at one-year follow-up [12]. Similarly, in two cases with a CTO, PCI using an antegrade and retrograde dissection and reentry technique stent deployment resulted in a compressive intramural haematoma associated with coronary flow compromise. In both occasions, the haematomas were resolved with a cutting balloon inflation and the patients remained asymptomatic without any adverse events at one-year follow-up [11]. In another report, where a balloon predilatation resulted in extensive vessel dissection, a compressive blood flow-limiting haematoma ensued stent deployment. This was successfully treated with a scoring balloon inflation and reinstatement of normal coronary blood flow. Cardiac biomarkers remained within normal range at 6 and 12 hours after procedure. In addition, follow-up coronary angiograms at three months and one year demonstrated an occluded false lumen and a normal coronary flow at the distal vessel [8].In our case, the patient presented with an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction, and therefore, we performed a single measurement of troponin levels on admission. Even though after inflation and retraction of the cutting balloon the distal vessel lumen diameter appeared slightly smaller compared to the initial angiogram before the PCI, this is an expected finding secondary to distal vasomotion and associated coronary spasm that have been induced by the vessel injury. Moreover, the specific intervention successfully restored a normal TIMI 3 flow and the patient remained completely asymptomatic at three months after his hospital discharge with a plan for further follow-up at one year after his PCI.Intramural haematoma is an uncommon complication of PCI, which can often be associated with detrimental clinical fallouts including profound ischaemia. Prompt recognition and treatment are of paramount importance. The utilisation of a cutting balloon technique, aiming to create microfenestrations of the intima layer of the arterial wall, is a simple, elegant, and practical method to effectively treat iatrogenic intramural haematoma after stent deployment that has been associated with excellent short and midterm outcomes.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Cardiac Tamponade from Purulent Pericarditis due to Cutibacterium acnes

Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) is an anaerobic bacteria that is ubiquitous in skin flora and is commonly thought of as a culture contaminant; however, it does have pathogenic potential. We present a case of purulent pericarditis secondary to C. acnes leading to cardiac tamponade. Initial stabilization and diagnosis were made via pericardiocentesis; afterward the patient underwent a pericardial window. Due to a severe penicillin allergy, he was successfully treated with a 14-day course of vancomycin. To our knowledge, this represents only the third published case of purulent pericarditis with cardiac tamponade caused by C. acnes and the first case treated with a 14-day course of vancomycin.Purulent pericarditis is a rare subset of bacterial pericarditis that is characterized by gross or microscopic purulence in the pericardium and most commonly develops from direct contiguous spread of an intrathoracic infection (such as pneumonia or mediastinitis) or intracardiac source and less commonly via hematogenous spread. Prior to World War II, purulent pericarditis was a fairly common disease with an incidence as high as 1 in 254 persons. In today’s age of modern antimicrobials, however, the incidence has decreased to 1 in 18,000 persons. Likewise, the spectrum of causal organisms has also changed, transitioning from an overwhelming majority of gram-positive organisms to the inclusion of gram-negative and anaerobic organisms. Despite decreasing incidence and improved antimicrobials, purulent pericarditis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality as it is rapidly progressive and highly fatal if left untreated [1, 2]. Several known complications of purulent pericarditis are reported to include cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, left ventricular pseudoaneurysm, and aortic mycotic aneurysm formation, among others [1–3]. The severity of these complications makes a high index of suspicion imperative to allow prompt diagnosis and treatment.A 71-year-old male presented to cardiology clinic with a 3-week history of worsening dyspnea, night sweats, and subjective fevers. Of note, he underwent an ischemic evaluation one week prior that was significant for newly identified left pleural effusion, moderate pericardial effusion, and mild pericardial thickening on chest CT (Figure 1).Initial physical exam was significant for a heart rate of 107 beats per minute and relative hypotension at 98/61 mmHg. Additionally, heart sounds were distant but jugular venous distention was absent. Later appreciated to have potential relevance, he was noted to have facial acne. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed which revealed that the effusion increased by greater than one centimeter since the most recent echocardiogram nine days prior and was now large and circumferential with early right ventricular diastolic collapse concerning for tamponade physiology (Figures 2 and 3). However, it also noted a nonplethoric inferior vena cava (IVC) and a lack of exaggerated respiratory inflow variability.Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of 370 mL of nonclotting serosanguinous fluid with immediate hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement. Gram stain of pericardial fluid demonstrated microscopic purulence with mixed inflammatory cells. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with vancomycin was initiated. Both 72-hour aerobic cultures and anaerobic cultures held for six days were negative. Full laboratory data from before and after the pericardiocentesis can be found in the table below (Table 1).Repeat bedside transthoracic echocardiogram on day three demonstrated resolution of the previously noted anterior effusion. With these imaging findings and with minimal pericardial drain output noted, the drain was removed. On day five, the patient experienced recurrent tachycardia to 121 beats per minute, relative hypotension at 97/64 mmHg, and tachypnea to 28 breaths per minute, prompting evaluation for pulsus paradoxus which was found to be 18 mmHg. Repeat TTE showed a large effusion and recurrent evidence of tamponade physiology (Figure 4). Following a heart team discussion, subxiphoid pericardial window and left-sided chest tube for pleural effusion were performed with removal of 800 mL and 200 mL of serosanguinous output, respectively. Anterior adhesions of the pericardium as well as loculated posterior pericardial effusion requiring blunt dissection were noted intraoperatively.Intraoperative anaerobic cultures of the pleural and pericardial fluid grew C. acnes after six and seven days, respectively, and anaerobic blood cultures from admission grew the same organism two weeks later. These results can be found in the table below (Table 2). Histopathology of operative pericardial samples showed fibrinous pericarditis with granulation tissue formation. Given the patient’s history of anaphylaxis to penicillin, he was initiated on a 14-day course of parenteral vancomycin. The patient was discharged from the hospital in stable condition and his symptoms remained controlled at follow-up. Also noted on follow-up was resolution of the pericardial effusion as seen on TTE (Figures 5 and 6).Although its incidence is decreasing, purulent pericarditis remains an important clinical diagnosis to make given the high attributable morbidity and mortality rates. Classically, purulent pericarditis presents with fever, dyspnea, and tachycardia, with a median time from symptom onset to presentation of seven days. Clinicians must have a high index of suspicion as it infrequently presents with the classic features of acute pericarditis such as pericardial chest pain, electrical alternans, and a pericardial friction rub, all of which were absent in this case. Electrocardiogram findings are variable and often normal, lacking the classic diffuse ST segment elevation and PR interval depression commonly seen in idiopathic or viral pericarditis [1, 3].It is prudent to understand the complicated interplay that can occur with the coexistence of hemodynamically significant pericardial disease and intravascularly volume-contracted states, such as that which occurs with sepsis physiology. Elevated pericardial pressure leads to compromised right ventricular filling greater than left ventricular filling resulting in impairment in stroke volume (SV). Cardiac output can be maintained in the setting of low SV with tachycardia until filling is impaired below a critical level or various compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed as seen in classic tamponade. Thus, low preload states should be corrected with volume expansion. It is important to realize that tamponade can even occur with normal central venous pressures, so-called low-pressure tamponade [4]. As our report emphasizes, utilization of echocardiography can detect early tamponade changes that precede severe hypotension allowing for urgent, not emergent, pericardiocentesis in a more controlled setting.Suspicion of purulent pericarditis should prompt urgent pericardiocentesis, a procedure which is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Aspirated fluid should be sent for cytology and bacterial, fungal, and tuberculous cultures. Additionally, blood cultures should be drawn to evaluate for bacteremia given the association with hematogenous spread [3]. Cultures should be kept for a minimum of seven days, as some organisms such as Cutibacterium acnes are unlikely to grow during the typical five-day incubation period [5, 6].Identification and aggressive treatment of the infectious source must be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is made. Pneumonia and empyema are the most common sources, but other potential sources include mediastinitis, periodontal infection, subphrenic abscess, and sepsis [2]. Risk factors for the development of this disease include immunosuppression, chest wall trauma, and increased alcohol intake [2, 7].Early detection and diagnosis are paramount in order to initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy and drainage. Prompt treatment can prevent complications such as constrictive pericarditis and cardiac tamponade [3]. Treatment options for pericardial fluid drainage include percutaneous pericardiocentesis and surgical pericardiotomy. Percutaneous pericardiocentesis provides rapid drainage; however, approximately 40% of patients go on to require surgical pericardiotomy after initial drainage [3]. Surgical pericardiotomy has higher success rates and lower rates of associated constrictive pericarditis [1]. Adjunctive interventions, such as pericardiectomy or intrapericardial fibrinolysis, may be required in patients with dense adhesions, loculated and frankly purulent effusions, recurrent tamponade, persistent infection, and evidence of constrictive pericarditis [8–11].Cutibacterium are gram-positive, catalase-positive, anaerobic bacilli. In general, Cutibacterium species have relatively low virulence and are slow-growing [12]. This pathogen is typically susceptible to penicillins, clindamycin, macrolides, quinolones, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. Resistance to aminoglycosides and metronidazole has been reported [13]. Given our patient’s history of anaphylaxis with penicillin, the decision was made to avoid penicillin desensitization and parenteral vancomycin therapy was selected in consultation with infectious disease specialists. Other reported antibiotic combinations for treatment of purulent pericarditis due to C. acnes include intravenous penicillin G for four weeks followed by twelve weeks of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and intravenous penicillin G for six weeks followed by oral doxycycline for six weeks [5, 6]. There is no widely agreed-upon treatment duration, and duration should be guided by the specific source.C. acnes is a rare cause of purulent pericarditis, although the incidence may be underestimated. Given its role as a normal component of skin flora, the growth of C. acnes is often dismissed and attributed to culture contamination. Additionally, the longer incubation time required to grow C. acnes may result in under detection given that most hospital systems discard blood cultures after a five-day incubation period [5, 6]. In the setting of pathologic infection, C. acnes has immune-stimulatory effects that promote inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. Thus, when identified as the causative pathogen in pericardial infections, it commonly leads to pericardial inflammation, pericardial effusions, and constrictive physiology [14].We reported a rare case of purulent pericarditis caused by Cutibacterium acnes, complicated by recurrent cardiac tamponade requiring surgical pericardiotomy which was successfully treated with a 14-day course of parental vancomycin due to a penicillin allergy. This case highlights the importance of a high clinical suspicion for the diagnosis given the lack of classic exam and electrocardiogram findings of pericarditis. Additionally, our case highlights the need to communicate directly with the microbiology lab to ensure adequate incubation times to detect less common pathogens.Informed consent was obtained for publication of this case history and associated images in line with COPE recommendations and ICMJE guidelines.The view(s) expressed herein are those of the authors and do not reflect the official policy or position of Brooke Army Medical Center, the U.S. Army Medical Department, the U.S. Army Office of the Surgeon General, the Department of the Army or the Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.All listed authors were involved in compilation of data and writing of this piece.
Mid-Left Ventricular Ballooning Variant Takotsubo Syndrome Induced by Treadmill Exercise Stress Testing
Department of Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Getu Teressa; ude.enicidemkoorbynots@asseret.utegReceived 10 July 2018; Accepted 30 October 2018; Published 15 November 2018Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2018 Gregg Cantor and Getu Teressa. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Stress-induced cardiomyopathy, also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, presents similar to a myocardial infarction after a physical or emotional stressor but without any evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Different patterns of myocardial involvement and several triggering events have been reported, but classically this condition is characterized by a stress-induced transient left ventricular apical systolic dysfunction. We describe a case of treadmill exercise stress testing-triggered variant of takotsubo cardiomyopathy with mid-left ventricular hypokinesis.Stress-induced cardiomyopathy, also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is classically characterized by a stress-induced transient left ventricular apical systolic dysfunction, electrocardiographic (EKG) abnormalities, and modestly elevated cardiac enzymes, mimicking myocardial infarction, but in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Postmenopausal women make up 90% of reported cases, and this condition constitutes up to 0.7-2.5% of cases evaluated for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [1]. Different patterns of myocardial involvement and several triggering events are being reported. We report the first case of treadmill exercise stress testing-triggered variant of takotsubo cardiomyopathy with mid-left ventricular hypokinesis in a 77-year-old female in which angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) demonstrated no obstructive CAD or ruptured plaques.A 77-year-old female with hypertension, untreated hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, but without prior history of CAD or angina symptoms was referred to a cardiologist’s office for a treadmill exercise test secondary to new onset palpitations. She denied any chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, or leg swelling. She quit smoking 36 years ago and has no family history of early cardiovascular diseases. She has a very distant cardiac work-up years ago, including a stress test and an echocardiogram, which the patient reported were unremarkable. Vital signs prior to the test were a blood pressure of 140/78, heart rate of 80, and a respiratory rate of 14. Physical exam was unremarkable except for a systolic ejection murmur that was graded II/VI at the base. EKG was at baseline with a normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and occasional premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).The patient underwent an exercise stress test using the Bruce protocol and was able to complete stage 1 with exercise for three minutes at a speed of 1.7 mph and a 10% incline. The test was terminated due to dyspnea and fatigue without chest pain. She reached a heart rate of 141 beats per minute which was 98% of predicted for her age. She accomplished 4.5 metabolic equivalents of exertion. With exercise, she had occasional atrial premature complexes and PVCs with a ventricular couplet in recovery. She started to notice tightness in her chest. Her peak blood pressure at the time was 218/90.The patient was transferred onto a stretcher, and an IV line was started. She was given sublingual nitroglycerin, 325 mg of aspirin to chew, and one 5 mg IV push of metoprolol tartrate. She then received nitroglycerin paste and metoprolol tartrate IV every 5 min for two more doses. At that time, her EKG on the stretcher showed ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 with ST depressions in leads III, aVF, and V1-V3 consistent with a lateral wall evolving myocardial infarction (Figure 1). She was transferred urgently to our institution for cardiac catheterization.The patient underwent an emergent cardiac catheterization with left ventriculography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) within 2 hours after onset of symptoms. Troponin-I levels prior to the catheterization increased to 11.17 (normal less than 0.05 ng/ml). The rest of the laboratories were within normal limits including a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. Coronary angiography showed nonobstructive coronary artery disease (pLAD 40%) and highly tortuous coronary arteries. IVUS of the proximal LAD revealed a minimal lumen area of 5.2mm2, and no ruptured plaques. Left ventriculogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and severe mid-cavitary hypokinesis with basal and apical hyperkinesis (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). To our knowledge, this is the first case of treadmill exercise testing-triggered mid-left ventricular ballooning variant of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, whereby obstructive epicardial CAD and ruptured plaques were excluded with angiography and IVUS, respectively.The patient was started on medical management with standard therapy for heart failure. A follow-up echocardiogram was done two days after the event which redemonstrated mid-left ventricular ballooning, with an improved LVEF of 35%. The patient remained asymptomatic during the course of her hospitalization and troponin levels trended down from a postcardiac catheterization peak of 16.06 ng/ml. An echocardiogram was repeated during an outpatient follow-up two weeks later which showed resolution of wall motion abnormalities and an LVEF of 45-50%.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is classically characterized by transient left ventricular apical ballooning in the presence of normal or nonobstructive CAD. Patients with transient left ventricular dysfunction usually present with acute onset of chest pain at rest and shortness of breath, along with ST segment elevation, nonspecific ST-T wave changes, and a mild increase in cardiac enzymes, making it indistinguishable from an acute myocardial infarction [1]. The incidence of this pathology is around 2% in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome and a positive troponin level [2]. The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy requires demonstration of normal epicardial coronaries and the absence of ruptured plaques [2–4]. Because of the limited use of cardiac catheterizations and IVUS, the incidence is likely underreported and the condition is therefore misdiagnosed. As the pathophysiology of the stress-induced cardiomyopathy is yet elusive to date, many patients with acute coronary syndrome-like presentations are subjected to treatments with unknown utility for the condition.Many hypotheses have been proposed to define the pathophysiology, including catecholamine-mediated cardiotoxicity, microvascular dysfunction, coronary vasospasm, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, estrogen deficiency, and cardiac autonomic imbalance [5, 6]. Although catecholamine-mediated cardiotoxicity is one of the most widely proposed mechanisms, given that patients typically present with a preceding history of extreme psychological and/or physical distress, the mechanism of this toxicity is far from being fully elucidated [7]. This mechanism of catecholamine-mediated toxicity has shown to have conflicting results, as some cases report elevated catecholamine levels in takotsubo cardiomyopathy, whereas others show catecholamine levels to have been normal [8]. Due to this, it is unclear if individuals vulnerable to takotsubo cardiomyopathy have heightened catecholamine release in response to stress or have an increased sensitivity to catecholamines than the general population undergoing similar stressful conditions. Another possibility is consistent with the predominance of takotsubo in postmenopausal women which is that a decrease in estrogen decreases the enhanced transcription of cardioprotective factors such as heat shock protein and atrial natriuretic peptide, which, in turn, would make these individuals more susceptible to the toxic effects of catecholamines [7]. However, given the heterogeneous manifestations and triggering events of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a single mechanistic explanation, such as catecholamine-mediated toxicity, may not adequately explain its pathogenesis.In conclusion, this case demonstrates treadmill exercise stress testing-triggered variant of takotsubo cardiomyopathy involving the mid-left ventricle in a patient with no demonstrable obstructive CAD nor ruptured plaques. There are multiple cases which report exercise-triggered classic takotsubo cardiomyopathy with apical dyskinesis without a significant decrease in ejection fraction [9–11]. Due to this, our case is unique not just for the involvement of the mid-left ventricle but also that it involved a significant drop in LVEF.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Congenital Ventricular Diverticulum or Aneurysm: A Difficult Diagnosis to Make

Being aware of these rare congenital anomalies is critical in making the diagnosis. Differentiating the two is important for treatment decisions. We describe a patient with dextrocardia, Tetralogy of Fallot, and a congenital left ventricular apical diverticulum diagnosed following the induction of anesthesia. CVD and CVA may present in the antenatal period through late adulthood with differing morphology, location, and symptoms. Echocardiography is paramount in the diagnosis and characterization of these lesions. If this anomaly is encountered after the induction of anesthesia or during intraoperative echocardiography, the cardiothoracic anesthesiologist should make the surgical team aware so it can be further characterized and a treatment plan made prior to incision.A pouch protruding from the free wall of the left ventricle may be either a congenital ventricular diverticulum (CVD) or aneurysm (CVA). Both have distinct presentations, morphology, associated defects, and prognosis. Differentiating the two is important for treatment decisions. We describe a patient with dextrocardia, Tetralogy of Fallot, and a congenital left ventricular apical diverticulum diagnosed following the induction of anesthesia and review the importance of this potentially fatal condition. Written permission was obtained for presentation of this case and patient images.A male infant was born at 38 weeks of gestation by cesarean section for nonreassuring heart rate and premature rupture of membranes. A prenatal diagnosis of dextrocardia and Tetralogy of Fallot was suspected. Apgars were 9 and 9 at one and five minutes. On physical exam, the child had normal saturations on room air and a 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border. Chest X-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary vascular markings. Electrocardiogram showed right ventricular hypertrophy. Initial cardiac echocardiography evaluation revealed dextrocardia, Tetralogy of Fallot with subvalvular pulmonary stenosis, anterior malalignment ventricular septal defect (VSD), small muscular VSD, persistent left superior vena cava (LSVC), secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) and normal pulmonary valve morphology. The child did well in the newborn period and was discharged home on no medications with a diagnosis of pink Tetralogy of Fallot. Over the next several months, the child developed signs of heart failure and poor growth and treatment was initiated with diuretics and high-calorie formula. The physical exam was notable for a right-sided point of maximal impulse (PMI), an active precordium that appeared to extend to the subcostal area and an umbilical hernia. Preoperative sedated transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild main pulmonary artery (MPA) and pulmonary valve hypoplasia and suspected left pulmonary artery stenosis (2.5 mm, Z = −3.5). A cardiac catheterization was performed and confirmed the left pulmonary artery stenosis (3.0 mm, Z = −3.0), and a left ventricular angiogram demonstrated dextrocardia and filling of both the aorta and pulmonary artery through the VSD. The child was taken to surgery for repair of Tetralogy of Fallot at 5 1/2 months of age. Following induction of anesthesia, a pulsatile mass was noted in the upper abdomen during line placement. Preoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed a previously unseen cor triatriatum in the left atrium with flow acceleration above the mitral valve. After median sternotomy, a diverticulum was noted to be extending from the left ventricular apex tracking down the anterior abdominal wall (Figure 1).Following the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass the malalignment VSD and additional muscular VSD were closed with a Dacron patch, the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) muscles were resected through the pulmonary valve, the ASD closed primarily, and the cor triatriatum resected. After separation from cardiopulmonary bypass the sternal incision was extended 1.5 cm into the upper abdomen. The left ventricular diverticulum was dissected out to the umbilicus and delivered into the chest with gentle traction and revealed a fingerlike pouch contracting synchronously with the left ventricle (Figure 2 and Video 1).An echocardiogram probe was placed directly on the diverticulum and demonstrated contractile muscle and blood within the cavity. A clamp was placed across the base of the diverticulum taking care to avoid the left anterior descending artery. Echocardiographic examination confirmed no change in ventricular function and the diverticulum was amputated and the defect oversewn in two layers. The patient recovered uneventfully. Review of the preoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed a contractile pouch extending from the apex of the left ventricle and contracting synchronously with it (Figure 3). The diverticulum was not visualized on the initial intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography exam.CVD and CVA are distinct entities with differing histology and presentation [1]. The rarity of the condition has led to inconsistent classification and terminology making diagnosis and treatment decisions difficult. CVD is used to describe an outpouching from a ventricle which contracts synchronously with that chamber and histologically contains all three layers of the ventricular wall (endocardium, myocardium, and pericardium) [2]. CVA is a ventricular protuberance which is akinetic or dyskinetic and on histology is predominantly fibrous tissue with no organized myocardium [3].The location and morphology of CVA and CVD vary with the age of presentation. CVD presenting in childhood may be divided into those presenting in the apical and nonapical regions of the heart. Those diverticula originating in the apex of the ventricle are always fingerlike contractile pouches extending into the abdomen and are associated with midline thoracoabdominal defects, congenital heart disease, and dextro or mesocardia [4]. They are typically less than 3 cm in length and 1.25 cm in width [5]. They occur much more frequently in the left ventricle but rarely have been reported in the right ventricle or in both ventricles [6, 7]. The midline defect may be obvious (omphalocele and epigastria hernia) or a small rent in the diaphragm discovered at the time of surgery. This collection of findings was described by Cantrell et al. in 1953 [8]. Congenital nonapical diverticulum presenting in childhood are contractile protuberances in multiple shapes and sizes with a narrow or wide connection to the chamber. The size of nonapical diverticulum reported in the literature has ranged from 0.5 cm to as large as 9 cm. They occur most commonly in the left ventricle but have been reported in the right ventricle, biventricular and right atrial position. They are not associated with cardiac or other congenital malformations [4].CVAs discovered in childhood are akinetic or dyskinetic protrusions extending from the free wall of the heart most commonly present in the left ventricle but may occur rarely in the right. CVAs may vary widely in size and when large compromise ventricular function [9]. They are always associated with a wide connection to the ventricle and are not associated with other congenital anomalies [10]. There may be multiple diverticulum or aneurysms present in a patient but there are only two reports of a patient having both a diverticulum and an aneurysm [11].Studies reporting CVA and CVD presenting in adulthood describe different morphology and locations than children even when the same classification systems are applied. Fingerlike, contractile diverticulum identical to those presenting in childhood only at the apex of the left ventricle are described in adults in all regions of the left ventricle except the anterobasal and septal area and less than 3% are associated with congenital heart disease. Fifty-six percent of CVD or CVA diagnosed in adults present at the apex of the left ventricle, with nearly one in five being a CVA [12]. The remainder of CVAs presenting in adults are often located in the subaortic region near the aortic valve or in close proximity to the mitral apparatus [7].There have been 809 published cases of left ventricular diverticulum or aneurysms [11] since the first report in 1816 in Germany [13] and a subsequent report in 1838 in the United Kingdom [14]. Improvements in echocardiography and the introduction of magnetic resonance imaging have brought about a rapid increase in the rate of diagnosis since the 24 known cases prior to 1950 [11]. The first reported surgical resection of a diverticulum was described in 1912 [15]. There have been twenty reported right ventricular apical diverticulum and a single right atrial diverticulum found at autopsy [16, 17]. An autopsy study of 12,924 consecutive children found an incidence of diverticulum or aneurysms of just 0.02% (3 cases) [18]. A retrospective study reviewing 12,271 consecutive adult heart catheterizations found an overall incidence of 0.76% (LVA 0.34% and LVD 0.42%) when the diagnosis of cardiac diverticulum or aneurysm was specifically investigated. Eighty-seven percent were missed at the time of catheterization [12]. A prevalence of 2.2% was reported in 680 consecutive adults undergoing multidetector computer topography angiography for suspected coronary disease [19]. This included diverticulum not extending beyond the free wall of the ventricle, often referred to as clefts, and not considered diverticulum in most classification systems [20]. This increasing prevalence and changing location with advancing age at presentation suggests that diverticulum and aneurysms of the cardiac free wall may develop later in adulthood as a result of increased intrachamber pressure in combination with a congenital predilection. Increased intraluminal pressures twice systemic pressures have been observed in nonapical ventricular diverticulum [21].In the ante- and neonatal period, CVD and CVA are most often discovered by echocardiography while the child is being evaluated for associated cardiac defects [22, 23]. The most common are Tetralogy of Fallot, venticular septal defect, and tricuspid atresia [4]. The diagnosis may be missed on echocardiography because the left ventricular apex may be difficult to observe and the diverticulum may not align with standard diagnostic views. In infants and children the diagnosis is more often made at the time of cardiac catheterization prior to surgical repair of associated congenital heart defects [24]. In one report, 15% of cases of CVD were first diagnosed when an abnormal abdominal pulsation and small diaphragmatic dehiscence were noted at the time of surgery [4]. The EKG and chest X-ray are typically nondiagnostic in infancy but may show nonspecific anomalies in adults [4, 25]. Cardiac MRI is useful to define the extent of the diverticulum, distinguish it from an akinetic or dyskinetic aneurysms, and for long-term follow-up [20].Nonapical diverticulum discovered in the neonatal period are most often diagnosed by echocardiography during investigation for arrhythmias. The majority of patients with nonapical diverticulum do not have cardiac dysfunction and may go unnoticed until adulthood [4]. Patients with large CVAs are often identified in an antenatal ultrasound. The prognosis for CVA diagnosed antenatally has generally been reported to be good [26]. However, CVAs may have associated significant ventricular dysfunction. The fetus should be followed with serial ultrasounds as those that continue to enlarge are associated with a poor prognosis [9].Congenital diverticulum and aneurysms not diagnosed at birth are often asymptomatic and found later in life coincidentally during diagnostic procedures for other indications [15]. The typical age at presentation is 30 to 60 years of age [12, 27]. Common presenting symptoms are angina and atypical chest pain (57%), arrhythmia and syncope (43%), dyspnea (20%), and stroke (6%) [12]. Rupture is rare but has been reported in 33 cases, with 90% of them occurring in patients younger than 18 years [11]. In adult presentation, the diagnosis is made on echocardiography, cardiac MRI, or cardiac catheterization. Patients may present with valvular pathology as those diverticulum and aneurysms in a perivalvular position may be associated with valvular insufficiency, prolapse, or perforation [28, 29].Congenital left ventricular apical diverticulum when discovered at the time of surgery for associated cardiac anomalies are resected and the chamber wall closed primarily to avoid possible later complications of arrhythmia, embolic stroke, and rupture [30, 31]. The prognosis in these patients from their diverticulum is excellent. The prognosis for nonapical diverticulum diagnosed in the neonatal period is also favorable. The decision to treat is made considering size, symptomatology, and prognosis. Spontaneous regression has been reported in two cases and the overall majority are free of symptoms in early childhood [4]. A nonapical diverticulum has been treated with closure by a PDA device placed percutaneously. That child has done well on follow-up [24]. The feasibility of this treatment depends on the location of the diverticulum and associated symptoms.The prognosis for CVAs diagnosed in the neonatal period is poor, with a survival rate of 30% reported [4]. Congenital aneurysms diagnosed antenatally may regress or increase in size to consume the ventricle. A reported case of an antenatally diagnosed ventricular aneurysm associated with massive pericardial effusion was treated with en utero drainage of the effusion and the aneurysm reabsorbed prior to birth. Conversely, an aneurysm diagnosed antenatally was followed and sequential ultrasound exams demonstrated continuous enlargement of the aneurysm with en utero demise [9].Patients presenting in adulthood show an overall benign course. Some authors have recommended surgical excision to avoid later complications [32] and others have recommended a more conservative approach [33]. In a study with a five-year follow-up, none of the 16 patients had died as a result of the lesion [34], and in another report, a patient was followed for 13 years without any change in the diverticulum or symptoms attributable to it [30]. Both diverticulum and aneurysms may be associated with morbidity with nearly 30% of patients experiencing one or more symptoms attributable to the aneurysm or diverticulum. Diverticulum and aneurysms were associated with embolic events in 11% of patients and arrhythmias and syncope in 14% of patients. Of these patients, the majority required ablation, pacemaker, or defibrillator placement [12].The etiology of congenital apical diverticulum has been postulated to be failure of fusion of the cardiac loop to the yoke sack [8]. Nonapical diverticulum are believed to be the result of failure of normal embryogenesis with a focal defect of the ventricular wall [3]. CVAs may be the result of failure of the formation of normal myocardial tissue secondary to a viral infection or localized ischemia [34, 35].Congenital left ventricular diverticulum and aneurysms must be differentiated from myocardial clefts and pseudoaneurysms. A myocardial cleft is a contractile, fissurelike protrusion within the myocardium that does not extend beyond the free wall of the ventricle. Clefts contract with systole and are often obliterated in systole. They occur from defects in myocardial fascicle arrangement and are of no prognostic significance. False aneurysms are composed of pericardium which has contained a myocardial rupture and are akinetic. They are typically the result of trauma or infarction [20].Congenital ventricular diverticulum and aneurysms are rare, potentially fatal anomalies. Being aware of this rare anomaly is critical in making the diagnosis. Differentiating them is imperative because of different presentations, associated disorders, prognosis, and treatment. CVD and CVA may present in the antenatal period through late adulthood with differing morphology and symptoms. Echocardiography is paramount in the diagnosis and characterization of these lesions.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.The authors would like to thank Shane Sullivan, RDCS PE, for his assistance with the cardiac ultrasound images.Supplementary 1.

Luckily the patient did not have any trauma to the IEA and was d/c home with no complications.

Angiogram showed that the sheath was inserted through the U-shaped portion of the IEA. Conclusion. Ultrasound guidance should be the first-line standard for arterial access in any cardiac catheterization procedure. US is a proven tool that can increase success and decrease complications in a wide variety of vascular access procedures.A major cause of morbidity and mortality during cardiac catheterization and percutaneous intervention is vascular access site complications [1]. Although the transradial approach has gained favor over the transfemoral as the access of choice due to fewer complications, transfemoral access is still necessary for procedures that require large bore access such as structural procedures, high-risk coronary interventions, and mechanical circulatory support procedures [2]. In the recent past research, much progress has been made in reducing the femoral access site complications such as arteriovenous fistula formation, hematoma development, an occurrence of arterial dissection, and retroperitoneal hemorrhages [3]. Though femoral access site complications have significantly reduced, the complication rate still looms around 3.7 to 4% [4, 5]. One such complication is puncture of the inferior epigastric artery which in the past has been reported to have led to catastrophic complications such as perforation, laceration, and dissection which lead to retroperitoneal hemorrhages [6]. Ultrasound is a modality that is not limited to formal radiological procedures anymore, but it is increasingly being utilized around the hospitals for various procedures [3]. Point of care ultrasounds have improved outcomes of multiple interventions, and hence, it would only be fair to employ this technique to avoid complications in the cardiac catheterization lab. We report a case in which entire cardiac catheterization was performed by accidentally accessing the inferior epigastric artery (IEA) through an unintentional puncture of the U-shaped portion of the inferior epigastric artery.A 48-year-old female with a history of hypertension and CAD S/P left circumflex stent many years ago who presented to our facility with persistent crescendo angina for which decision was made to proceed with LHC. A micropuncture needle was used to obtain femoral access after fluoroscopy was used for anatomical localization of the CFA. A 6 F slender sheath was inserted and flushed. The cardiac catheterization showed no significant CAD with a patent stent, so it was decided that there is no further intervention needed. At the end of the procedure, it was suggested to use a closure device, so femoral angiogram was done at the end to assess the arteriotomy site which showed that the stick was high and the tip of the sheath was about to come out of the CFA (Figure 1); at the same time, it came into our minds that the sheath could be passing through the IEA by sticking the U portion of the IEA, but due to the high risk, a wire was passed through the sheath in order to secure access (Figure 2). Immediate access was obtained through the contralateral groin (Figure 3) then a balloon over the wire was passed beyond the original sheath tip (Figure 4), and then the sheath was slowly pulled back while contrast was injected. Angiogram showed that the sheath was inserted through the U-shaped portion of the IEA (Figure 5) and that the IEA had no dissection nor laceration. In the end, a closure device (Mynx) was applied to the access site and hemostasis was achieved. The patient was followed in the hospital and discharged home with no complications. The patient was seen in the clinic with no complications.Conventionally, femoral access is sought by the palpation of arterial pulses and identification of the anatomical landmarks by fluoroscopy. As per new recommendations, four techniques should be utilized in a combination to achieve access to the femoral artery. These four techniques are (a) fluoroscopy, (b) ultrasound, (c) micropuncture access, and (d) femoral angiography [2].In our case, we relied on fluoroscopy alone in achieving femoral access, which led to cardiac catheterization that was done entirely through the inferior epigastric artery, through unintentional puncture of the U-shaped portion of the inferior epigastric artery (IEA). The origin of the IEA can vary. In 76% of cases, the origin of the IEA is from the external iliac artery (EIA) above the inguinal ligament. In 12% of cases, IEA arises from the behind of inguinal ligament, while in 8% of the cases, it arises from the femoral artery and in 4% of cases, it can arise from a common trunk with an abnormal obturator artery [7]. IEA artery after its origin is found anterior to the CFA following a U-shaped course inferiorly prior to continuing superiorly; it is at this site that the IEA is vulnerable to unintentional punctures. Moza et al. in 2013 also reported this as the site of puncture [8], which is similar to our case.In our case, it was the due diligence of the operator that a catastrophe was avoided. Cases have been reported where the patients were not fortunate enough. Sanchez and Helmy reported two cases of the perforation of the inferior epigastric artery during cardiac catheterization. Sanchez and Helmy were able to identify the perforation in case 1 after the contrast dye extravasated into the peritoneal cavity, but it inadvertently led to the delaying of PCI by a day. Case 2 as reported by Sanchez and Helmy was identified after the patient complained of abdominal pain and upon further investigation; it was revealed that the patient had developed a retroperitoneal hemorrhage with acute blood loss anemia for which the patient had to be catheterized again [6].Injury to the IEA can lead to fatal consequences unless managed aptly, the traditional approach to manage IEA entails external compression, balloon tamponade [6], thrombin injection [9], coil, and gel foam embolization [10]. Moza et al. reported having used the Angio-Seal vascular closure device [8]. On the contrary, in our case, we used a Mynx closure device to attain homeostasis and the patient remained stable.In recent years, it has been advocated that the real-time ultrasound prior to gaining access would be invaluable and would lead to fewer complications. Kalish et al. concluded from a retrospective study of the Vascular Study Group of New England database that ultrasound-guided (UG) vascular intervention was protective against hematoma (rate ratio (RR), 0.62; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.84), while the subgroup analysis revealed that UG intervention protected against hematoma in patients with age over 80 years, BMI of ≥30, and sheath size > 6 F [11]. Femoral Artery Access with Ultrasound Trial (FAUST) is the largest trial, of 1004 patients; it concluded that in comparison to fluoroscopy, ultrasound guidance did not have any difference in CFA cannulation, while the in-depth subgroup analysis revealed that UG had better first-pass success (86% vs. 43%, ), reduced number of attempts (1.3 vs. 3, ), reduced median time to access (136 s vs. 148 s, ), reduced risk of venipuncture (2.4% vs. 15.8%, ), and reduced vascular complications (1.4% vs. 3.4%, ) [12].Point of care ultrasound despite being readily available across most of the hospitals in the United States of America has not been employed to gain access in vascular intervention. A small survey published by Soverow et al. in 2016 reported that 13.3% of the respondents utilized ultrasound, despite 90% respondents expressed that they would be comfortable to use them and 88% acknowledged that ultrasound was readily available [13].Ultrasound guidance should be the first-line standard for arterial access in any cardiac catheterization procedure. US is a proven tool that can increase success and decrease complications in a wide variety of vascular access procedures.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Nodular Calcification in Saphenous Vein Graft Successfully Treated by Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

However, it is very rare to find in a saphenous vein graft (SVG). We herein report a rare case of stable angina pectoris (AP) due to nodular calcification. A 75-year-old man who had previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting was admitted to our hospital due to stable AP. On angiography, significant stenosis was detected in the proximal SVG. Based on the findings of coronary angiography and optical coherence tomography, a red thrombus was suspected at the culprit lesion. However, nodular calcification was also suspected, as there were calcifications around the lesion. As intravascular ultrasound showed the protruding calcification, which we judged to be a nodular calcification, the calcified SVG lesion was successfully treated by percutaneous coronary intervention without any complications. Nodular calcification should be considered as a potential cause of AP, even when located in a SVG.Nodular calcification is sometimes detected in the native coronary artery but is very rarely located in a saphenous vein graft (SVG). We herein report a rare case of stable angina pectoris (AP) due to nodular calcification in a SVG successfully treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).A 75-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to stable AP. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) had been performed 15 years earlier. The left internal thoracic artery (LITA) and SVG were anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery, respectively. He also had diabetes, hypertension, and hemodialysis.On coronary angiography, the right coronary artery and LAD were totally occluded. There was no significant stenosis in the left circumflex. Regarding the bypass graft, the LITA-LAD was patent but the SVG had significant stenosis at the proximal site (Figure 1(a)). Therefore, the SVG lesion was considered to be the culprit lesion for AP.The SVG stenosis appeared to be a thrombotic lesion on angiography, despite the presence of stable AP. To confirm the lesion characteristics, we performed optical coherence tomography (OCT). The OCT findings also suggested a red thrombus with attenuation (Figure 1(b)). However, nodular calcification was also suspected, as there were calcifications around the lesion. Therefore, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was also performed to distinguish the red thrombus from the nodular calcification. As protruding calcification was detected by IVUS (Figure 1(c)), the lesion was judged as not the red thrombus but the nodular calcification. There were no diffuse degenerative plaques at the culprit lesion according to the OCT and IVUS findings.Rotational atherectomy was considered for the treatment of this focal and protruding calcified lesion, although the use of a rotablator for a diffuse degenerative SVG lesion is basically contraindicated. Figure 2(a) shows the OCT findings preablation, and Figures 2(b) and 2(c) show the postablation OCT findings using 1.75 and 2 mm rotablator burrs, respectively. After ablation with a rotational atherectomy device, predilation with a scoring balloon (NSE 3.0 × 13 mm, Goodman Co., Ltd.) and stenting (Promus 3.5 × 16 mm, Boston Scientific) were performed. A well-apposed and expanded stent was confirmed based on the poststenting OCT findings (Figure 3). The nodular calcification in the SVG was successfully treated by PCI without any complications (Figure 4).A SVG is commonly used as a conduit for CABG. However, SVGs are associated with poor long-term patency rates after CABG. SVG disease can be present in approximately 30% of patients 5 years after CABG [1]. Reoperation of CABG is reported to carry an increased risk of periprocedural death and myocardial infarction [2]. Therefore, PCI should be considered for the treatment of SVG lesions in order to avoid reoperation.However, SVG intervention remains technically challenging and is also associated with increased rates of periprocedural myocardial infarction, in-hospital mortality, restenosis, and occlusion compared with PCI of native coronary arteries mainly because of the friable, degenerated atheromatous, and thrombotic debris that develop when SVGs deteriorate [3, 4]. Foam cell infiltration can be observed within 1 year of SVG implantation, with subsequent necrotic core formation and rupture ensuing after seven years in over one-third of patients [5]. Therefore, SVG lesions may be the culprit for acute coronary syndrome [6]. Calcification is also seen in the SVG as a result of atherosclerosis, being reportedly found in 40% of patients undergoing SVG PCI according to IVUS findings [7]. The present case was not one of acute coronary syndrome but stable AP with calcified lesion detected by IVUS.Nodular calcification is calcified plaque projecting into the vessel lumen and is sometimes detected in the native coronary artery [8]. However, nodular calcification resembles a red thrombus on coronary angiography and OCT [9]. Therefore, it is important to distinguish the red thrombus from the nodular calcification when we perform PCI. Both nodular calcification and organized thrombus are identified as a protruding mass with signal attenuation on OCT. In the present case, IVUS findings were helpful in distinguishing the red thrombus from the calcification. IVUS depicted a bright protruding mass with marked posterior shadowing, hallmarks suggestive of a heavily calcified plaque. As nodular calcification mimics red thrombus on OCT, we should carefully interpret intravascular images and be aware of the diagnostic accuracy of OCT [10].Debulking devices should be considered in the treatment of calcified lesions. However, nodular calcification in the SVG is very rare, and PCI for this lesion using rotational atherectomy might be challenging. Thomas et al. reported that 17 calcified lesions in the SVGs were treated in 14 patients using a rotational atherectomy device and that TIMI 3 flow was present in all patients before and at the completion of the intervention [11]. Transient slow-flow phenomenon occurred in 1 of 17 lesions (6%) in association with chest pain and ST segment elevation. One patient had a dissection complicated by transient abrupt closure of the SVG distal anastomosis, which was successfully treated with prolonged balloon inflation. No distal emboli or persistent vessel spasm was seen. Procedural success was achieved in 100% of patients. Therefore, ablation by the rotational atherectomy device may be an option for managing nodular calcification, even in SVG.In the present case, SVG stenosis resembled a thrombotic lesion on coronary angiography and OCT. However, IVUS showed protruding calcification, suggesting it was nodular calcification. The appropriate use of imaging modalities was helpful for achieving an accurate diagnosis and performing the optimal treatment in this rare case of nodular calcification in a SVG.Nodular calcification was detected in a SVG 15 years after CABG. Nodular calcification should be considered as a potential cause of AP, even when located in a SVG.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in an 8-Month-Old Infant for Ostial Stenosis of a Reimplanted Left Main Coronary Artery

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a routine procedure undertaken in adult patients. In children, the procedure remains rare and challenging due to a multitude of factors including but not limited to complex congenital heart disease anatomy, catheter and stent to patient size mismatch, and lack of data for post-PCI antiplatelet therapy. We present a case of PCI in an 8-month-old infant with anomalous left coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) who developed severe ostial kinking of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) after surgical reimplantation of the anomalous coronary. A 3.5 × 8 mm Vision bare metal stent was successfully placed into the LMCA and postdilated with excellent results. Follow-up echocardiography at 6 months post-PCI demonstrated a patent stent with normal Doppler flow signals. Despite initial success, the infant developed severe heart failure and was listed for orthotopic heart transplantation at age 20 months, one year after PCI. Given the paucity of published data regarding PCI and outcomes in infants with ALCAPA after surgical reimplantation, we describe our case and present a review of the available literature.Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), also known as Bland-White-Garland syndrome, is a congenital coronary anomaly comprising 0.4% of all congenital heart diseases. The hemodynamic significance of ALCAPA arises after birth, when systemic pressures exceed pulmonary pressures and myocardial ischemia occurs as a result of low perfusion pressure in the left-sided circulation territory. Furthermore, development of heterocollateral circulation from the right-sided system to preserve the left-sided perfusion can result in coronary artery steal. Definitive treatment involves reimplantation of the LMCA from the pulmonary artery into the aorta. Coronary obstruction in the reimplanted artery is a rare complication but can result in significant myocardial ischemia, infarction, and heart failure necessitating further intervention. Percutaneous coronary intervention can be used as a minimally invasive approach to correct such complications after surgical reimplantation in ALCAPA. Despite its ubiquity in the treatment of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease in adults, PCI is performed infrequently in the pediatric population with less than 100 cases reported involving the left main coronary artery (LMCA) [1]. The small vessel size of infants in particular contribute to the complexity of PCI procedures undertaken in this age group and present a host of periprocedural complications related to catheter and stent to patient size mismatch: occlusion ischemia, vessel dissection or rupture, and creation of intimal flaps which may lead to subsequent myocardial ischemia and infarction [2]. Even in uncomplicated cases, stent selection with consideration to ongoing vessel growth poses a unique challenge to PCI in the pediatric population. Given the paucity of data with regard to PCI in infants with surgically repaired ALCAPA, we describe a case with additional review of the literature.An 8-month-old female infant had coronary reimplantation at age 3 months for ALCAPA. Postsurgical ejection fraction showed early improvement with subsequent deterioration. A diagnostic left heart catheterization performed as part of a heart transplant evaluation revealed severe ostial stenosis of the LMCA. She was referred for PCI of the left main coronary artery to relieve her heart failure and preempt transplant. Her physical exam was significant for congestive heart failure and failure to thrive. The patient’s echocardiogram showed markedly depressed left ventricular function. A cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) and initial diagnostic nonselective root aortogram demonstrated stenosis of the LMCA at the site of ALCAPA reimplantation. Selective left coronary angiogram revealed severe kinking of the reimplanted LMCA at the ostium (Figure 1).The procedure was performed in the Pediatric Cardiology interventional suite after extensive discussion and planning with Pediatric and Adult Interventional Cardiology, Pediatric Cardiac Anesthesia, Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, and Pediatric Cardiac Radiology. General anesthesia and a femoral arterial approach were utilized. An ascending aortic root angiogram was obtained in 2 planes to assess the ostial left main stenosis. Due to the small size of the infant aorta, a 6 Fr JR-4 guide was reshaped to engage the left main coronary artery. A BMW wire was used to cross the lesion. Since the infant left main coronary artery was small but was expected to grow with age, a somewhat larger (3.0 × 8 mm Vision bare metal) stent was carefully implanted in the proximal LMCA at less than nominal pressure to avoid distal dissection. A poststent angiogram showed that the stent had moved during implantation and missed the ostium with residual stenosis of the LMCA origin. Hence, a 3.5 × 8 mm Vision bare metal stent was placed into the LMCA ostium overlapping with the previous stent distally and protruding 1-2 millimeters in the aorta proximally. The ostium and aortic overhanging portion of the stent were postdilated producing proximal flaring. The final angiogram confirmed excellent stent position and normal flow (Figure 2).The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel one day after PCI. She was followed in Cardiology clinic post-PCI and noted to have no change in her ventricular function. Nevertheless, she continued to do well clinically until six months post-PCI, at which time she demonstrated failure to thrive and required admission for initiation of continuous milrinone infusion. The left main stent was widely patent with normal Doppler flow signals as visualized by echocardiography (Figure 3). She was listed as status 1A for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) and underwent transplantation one year post-PCI, at age 20 months.Percutaneous coronary intervention in infants remains rare with only four prior cases reported in ALCAPA patients [3–6]. Of the four previously described cases, only one attributed the coronary obstruction to a flap of tissue from the surgical anastomosis site; the other three did not detail specific structural etiologies of coronary obstruction. Wires, balloons, and stents used in all four cases were different, as were post-PCI antiplatelet therapy regimens and follow-up intervals and modalities (Table 1).The aforementioned variability in treatment of postsurgical coronary obstruction in ALCAPA patients highlights several challenges to performing PCI in infants. Firstly, the pathophysiology of postsurgical coronary obstruction in ALCAPA is not well understood, though it is hypothesized that traction placed on the LMCA after reimplantation in the aorta and disruption of the vaso vasorum during surgery both play a key role [7]. Nevertheless, coronary artery reimplantation remains the standard of care with alternative surgical approaches including coronary artery ligation, Takeuchi procedure (creation of an aortopulmonary window and intrapulmonary baffle), and subclavian artery anastomosis demonstrating inferior outcomes [8, 9]. Coronary artery extension techniques have been employed and proven successful in reducing traction in select populations; however, these surgical techniques are utilized mainly in palliative cases or centers were surgical experience in coronary artery reimplantation is not readily available [10–12]. Percutaneous coronary intervention thus offers an alternative to repeat operation in cases of coronary artery obstruction after reimplantation, though it may ultimately be limited by treatment of a surgical problem.Long-term outcomes of PCI in surgically corrected ALCAPA patients are also largely unknown. Of the four previously reported cases, two reported no limitations in follow-up visits at age 6 and 7 years [5, 6], though one case required surgical intervention for recurrent mitral regurgitation in the interim. The other two only reported follow-up data within one year post-PCI [3, 4]. Instrumentation including wires, balloons, and stents used in the pediatric population are variable and in accordance with feasibility of procedure as well as preference of the interventionalist. Review of PCI across all indications in the pediatric population show that standard 0.014 wires were most often employed in crossing coronary obstructions. Noncompliant coronary balloons and stents that approximated the adjacent unaffected vessel diameter were most often selected [13, 14]. Data extrapolated from a retrospective review of 33 infant stent implantations across all indications, over four years at a single institution by Stanfill et al., show that 73% of implanted stents required at least one redilation [14]. Stent thrombosis has been reported in up to 3% of pediatric coronary PCI cases and up to 7% of pediatric noncoronary PCI cases [14, 15]. Nevertheless, standardized antiplatelet therapy regimens and durations have not yet been established at present.Percutaneous coronary intervention remains rare and challenging in infants. Close collaboration with Adult and Pediatric Interventional Cardiology is vital to the success of these procedures, thereby making them less challenging. Percutaneous coronary intervention is a feasible option in infants who develop coronary obstruction after surgical reimplantation for ALCAPA.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Large Solid Right Atrial Thrombus Treated by AngioVac Catheter-Based Suction Thrombectomy

Pascual-FigalCopyright © 2018 Jacob Schultz et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We present the successful treatment of a large solid right atrial thrombus by the catheter-based suction embolectomy system AngioVac® (AngioDynamics, NY, USA). A previously healthy 60-year-old male was referred with acute pulmonary embolism, a large deep vein thrombus and a large right atrial thrombus. After one week of anticoagulation, the size of the atrial thrombus was unaltered, and the patient was treated by catheter-directed embolectomy using the AngioVac system. The solid thrombus occluded the catheter during the procedure. With the vacuum maintained, the occluded catheter was removed from the patient and the thrombus mass was removed. The remaining atrial thrombus was successfully removed by suction after the reinsertion of the catheter. The patient recovered well and was discharged 7 days after the procedure. The therapy was safe and minimally invasive.Catheter-based aspiration therapy has shown promise in the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The AngioVac system consists of a large (22F) bore catheter with an expandable funnel-shaped distal tip. The catheter is connected to an extracorporeal venous-venous bypass system, allowing for filtration of aspirated blood from thrombi before reintroducing the blood into the systemic circulation [1]. The system is primarily used in the peripheral circulation, but it is increasingly utilized in the treatment of central venous thrombi and other masses [2–5]. The majority of published cases report successful removal of larger thrombi [3, 4]. Cases with firmer and/or adherent thrombi have meanwhile posed a challenge [4]. Here, we present the successful treatment of a large solid right atrial thrombus with the catheter-based suction embolectomy system AngioVac.A previously healthy 60-year-old male was referred to the outpatient clinic due to atrial fibrillation. The patient reported pain in the lower left leg for 3 weeks followed by right-sided chest pain and dyspnea for 2 weeks. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a dilated right atrium (RA) with a large longitudinal thrombus (1–1.5 cm × 15–20 cm) fluctuating through the tricuspid valve (Video 1). The patient was stable and had no signs of right or left ventricular strain. Treatment with rivaroxaban 15 mg × 2 was initiated, and he was admitted to our center with suspected multilevel VTE: deep venous thrombosis (DVT), RA thrombus, and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Computed tomography confirmed PE in the lower right pulmonary artery with associated pleural effusion. TTE and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed the RA thrombus. Ultrasound revealed a large DVT in the left femoral vein stretching from the popliteal to the iliac vein. The patient was switched from rivaroxaban to unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5000 IE bolus followed by infusion starting at 1000 IE/hour and monitored by APTT. APPT remained in the lower range (maximum 77) treatment despite increasing doses of UFH to a maximum dose of 1900 IE/hour. After 3 days of UFH treatment, there was no regression of RA thrombus on TTE. The thrombus appeared to be attached in a thin fibrotic pedicle to the area between the superior vena cava and RA (Video 2). No persistent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect was found. Due to the large size and thin attachment, the risk of a possibly fatal PE was considered significant. As there were no regression in thrombus despite 7 days of anticoagulation treatment, it was decided to refer the patient for catheter-based embolectomy using the AngioVac system.Preprocedural planning included a new ultrasound of the lower extremities that confirmed regression of thrombus in the lower veins bilaterally. This allowed for a femoral venous-venous access. The procedure was performed in a hybrid suite with a multidisciplinary team from interventional cardiology and thoracic surgery enabling fast conversion to extracorporeal circulation and surgical embolectomy if needed. The patient was placed in general anesthesia, and the procedure was guided by fluoroscopy and continuous TEE. A 26F dry-seal sheath (Gore Medical®) was placed in the right femoral vein to accommodate the AngioVac cannula and an 18F reinfusion cannula in the left femoral vein. A venous sheath was placed in the left external jugular vein to allow for conversion to a jugular approach, insertion of an adjunctive catheter, or a temporary v. cava filter if needed. Furthermore, a 6F sheath was placed in the right femoral artery allowing easy conversion to venous-arterial bypass.The catheter was placed in the inferior vena cava. The funnel-shaped tip was then opened, and the centrifugal pump started. Using a flow of 3.5 L/min, the catheter was slowly moved towards the RA, and part of the thrombus was sucked into the tip. The solid thrombus occluded the catheter and stopped the flow completely. With the vacuum maintained, the occluded catheter was removed from the patient, and the thrombus was removed from the catheter (Video 3). The catheter was reintroduced to the RA, and this time thrombus material was sucked out and into the filter (Figure 1(a)). A small thrombus of 5 × 8 mm remained attached despite significant suction (Video 4). Sheaths were removed and venous access closed by percutaneous suture and the arterial access by Angio-Seal®. The thrombus fragments removed by the procedure measured a total of 15 × 1 cm and consisted of heterogeneous solid older thrombus material (Figure 1(b)), which was confirmed by the pathologist after the procedure.The patient recovered well after the procedure. He was treated with low molecular weight heparin (7500 IEx2) and was discharged 7 days postprocedure to follow-up in the outpatient PE clinic.The AngioVac system has previously been used for central venous thrombi. Despite being the largest catheter available, large thrombi may however still occlude the lumen and stop the circuit. While the substantial vacuum can deform or fragment fresh thrombi, this may not be the case with more chronic thrombi. In the present case, the thrombus proved more solid than expected, and the catheter was obstructed. We successfully removed the catheter and thrombus en bloc. Despite the vacuum, thrombus material may dislodge and embolize to the pulmonary circulation. While the potential of the technique is promising, we advocate that procedures are only performed in tertiary centers with access to acute surgical embolectomy, preferably using a multidisciplinary approach.We describe the successful treatment of a large solid right atrial thrombus with the catheter-based suction embolectomy system AngioVac. The therapy was safe and minimally invasive.The authors have received informed consent from the patient to publish information and images.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests.The authors thank the colleagues at the Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery and the Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, for their invaluable contribution to this case.

As yet, no specific CRP inhibitor for human application has been described. A 69-year-old male was referred with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Typical symptoms of chest pain started at 10.00 p.m. The patient was admitted to the hospital at 1.30 a.m. the next day. As ECG showed anterior wall myocardial infarction, the patient was immediately transferred to successful emergency angioplasty/drug-eluting- (DE-) stenting of the subtotally occluded left anterior descending artery. Consecutively, the hemodynamically stable patient was monitored at the chest pain unit. C-reactive protein (CRP) apheresis using the CRP adsorber (PentraSorb® CRP) within CAMI-1 trial was performed 34 h and 58 h after the onset of symptoms. In each apheresis session, 6000 ml plasma was treated via peripheral venous access. Plasma CRP levels decreased from 28.77 mg/l to 12.58 mg/l during the first apheresis session and from 24.17 mg/l to 11.55 mg/l during the second session, respectively. No side effects were observed. This is the first report of selective CRP apheresis in a man. The technology offers multiple opportunities to clarify the immunological/pathogenic role of CRP in health and disease.For more than two decades, the role of C-reactive protein (CRP) in cardiovascular disease has been controversially and emotionally discussed. Divergent data and opinions have left the scientific community in doubt as to whether CRP is causal in cardiovascular disease or not [1–3]. As interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induces IL-6, which in turn induces CRP synthesis in the liver, the CANTOS trial has rapidly revitalized the international interest in the matter [4, 5]. IL-1β inhibition, however, is an immunological intervention with many potential side effects. Ultimately, specific CRP inhibition in controlled clinical trials may be the only way to prove or disprove a causative role of CRP in cardiovascular disease [3]. Here, we provide the first report of selective CRP apheresis [6] in a man, a CRP-specific technology that removes CRP from the plasma and may finally help to clarify the immunological/pathogenic role of CRP in health and disease.A 69-year-old male was referred to Cardiovascular Center Oberallgäu-Kempten with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Typical symptoms of chest pain started at 10.00 p.m. The hemodynamically stable patient was admitted to the hospital at 1.30 a.m. the next day. Medical history revealed adenocarcinoma of the medial rectum (pT1, pN0 (0/14), L0, V0, R0, GII, cM0 (UICC I)) with anterior rectum resection in 2014 and complete remission. Furthermore, the patient suffered from chronic kidney disease, stage 3.ECG showed anterior wall myocardial infarction (Figure 1(a)). The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and received successful emergency angioplasty/drug-eluting- (DE) stenting of the subtotally occluded left anterior descending artery (Figure 1(b)). Transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy, moderately reduced systolic left ventricular function (LVEF 40%) with anterior, septal, anteroseptal, inferior-apical, and apical hypo- and akinesia. The hemodynamically stable patient was monitored at the chest pain unit. CRP apheresis [7] using the CRP adsorber (PentraSorb® CRP) within C-reactive Protein Apheresis in Acute Myocardial Infarction (CAMI-1) trial [8] was performed 34 h and 58 h after the onset of symptoms. In each apheresis session, 6000 ml plasma was treated via peripheral venous access. Plasma CRP levels declined from 28.77 mg/l to 12.58 mg/l during the first apheresis session and from 24.17 mg/l to 11.55 mg/l during the second session, respectively (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Figure 2 also shows cardiac enzyme progress over 72 h. Elevated creatinine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and troponin levels at admission documented acute STEMI. CRP levels, however, were normal at admission and, as a result of myocardial necrosis, increased with time [9]. CRP apheresis efficiently counteracted acute phase CRP elevation and reduced peak CRP plasma levels.The patient tolerated apheresis with no clinically relevant symptoms. No side effects were observed, especially signs of infection. The patient was, on his own request, discharged in a good general condition, on day 5 after the onset of symptoms.Although CRP is known since 1930 [10], not all facets of the molecule’s role in the human immune system are yet discovered. Paradoxically, in spite of its widespread clinical use, relatively little is known about CRP’s biological functions. The two known CRP functions [11] are as follows: firstly, activation of the classical complement pathway up to C3/C4 via C1q binding and secondly, binding to human immunoglobulin Fcγ receptors (mainly FcγRIIa) after opsonization of biological particles for macrophages [12]. Notably, these functions are also antibody functions. For this reason, it is not unlikely that CRP has been the first antibody-like molecule in the evolution of the mammalian immune system [3]. As CRP functions have been taken over by antibodies with time, CRP may well be an atavism in the human immune system. This hypothesis is underpinned by the complete lack of immunological side effects of selective CRP apheresis in our patient. Nonetheless, the results of CAMI-1 and other carefully designed clinical trials with CRP apheresis have to be awaited. A secondary prevention study in analogy to CANTOS may be conceivable. Also, the role of CRP in stroke [13] or autoimmune disease [14] may be elucidated via selective CRP apheresis.This is the first report on selective CRP apheresis in a man. CRP apheresis offers multiple opportunities to clarify the immunological and eventually pathogenic role of CRP in health and disease.Consent for publication has been obtained, in line with the COPE best practice guidelines, and the individual who is being reported on is aware of the possible consequences of that reporting.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
The Wire Rendezvous and Chasing Wire Technique in the Bidirectional Approach for the Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Chronic Total Occlusion with a Single Guiding Catheter

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A bidirectional approach for percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion (CTO-PCI) using ipsilateral collaterals with a single guiding catheter limits procedural choices. The CTO of the left circumflex artery with ipsilateral collateral artery was treated by the bidirectional approach using a single guiding catheter. While the retrograde wire directly crossed the CTO lesion, the microcatheter could not pass the CTO lesion despite the conventional strategies. Therefore, we performed the wire rendezvous and chasing wire techniques. The wire rendezvous technique enables deeper retrograde guidewire progression, and the antegrade microcatheter can reach the CTO entry. The chasing wire technique enables the antegrade guidewire to pass the route made by the retrograde guidewire. These techniques might offer a possible solution for bidirectional CTO-PCI using a single guiding catheter. However, this technique should be considered as a last resort because of the risk of rapid reocclusion.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusion (CTO) has improved not only patients’ symptoms [1] and left ventricular function [2] but also long-term mortality [3, 4]. The advancement of techniques [5] and devices [6, 7] for CTO-PCI has contributed to this development. In addition, the procedural steps in current CTO-PCI have also been established [8]. Although the antegrade approaches, including the manipulation of stiff wires, knuckle wire technique, parallel wire technique, subintimal tracking and reentry (STAR) technique [9], contrast-guided STAR technique [10], or reentry devices [11, 12], are important, the retrograde approach is a particularly promising strategy in this era. The most commonly used collateral artery for the retrograde approach is the contralateral collateral artery, e.g., the right coronary artery (RCA) for the left coronary artery. However, some CTO lesions involve the ipsilateral collateral artery, such as the left anterior descending artery (LAD) to the left circumflex artery (LCX) or bridge collateral arteries. CTO-PCI with ipsilateral collateral channels is challenging [13]. A double guiding-catheter strategy, the so called “ping-pong” technique, could be one possible option, which leads to the smooth manipulation of the retrograde approach without interference from the antegrade system. This technique was reported for treating complications [14, 15] and CTO-PCI [16]. On the other hand, the single guiding-catheter strategy could be a less invasive option but limits the procedure choices because of the interferences in both systems. Herein, we present a novel strategy named the wire rendezvous and chasing wire technique. “Wire rendezvous” indicates full insertion of the retrograde wire into the antegrade microcatheter to advance the antegrade microcatheter tracking on the retrograde wire. “Chasing wire” indicates pushing the antegrade guidewire and pulling the retrograde guidewire simultaneously to let the antegrade guidewire track the route made by the retrograde guidewire before reocclusion. These techniques result in antegrade CTO crossing. These techniques could be options in the bidirectional approach for CTO-PCI using the single guiding catheter.A 78-year-old man with heart failure and low ejection fraction was referred to our institution. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, heart rate of 82 beats, and complete left branch bundle block. Laboratory data indicated 1.04 mg/dL of creatinine, 7.0% of HbA1c, and 268 pg/mL of brain natriuretic protein. Echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 30%, left ventricle diastolic diameter of 60 mm, diffuse hypokinesis, and apical akinesis. Angiography after compensated heart failure revealed hypoplasty of the right coronary artery, severe stenosis with heavy calcification of the LAD, and CTO of the LCX (Figure 1). We first treated the LAD with standard stenting (Figure 2). Computed tomography after successful revascularization of LAD revealed a short and mildly calcified CTO; and a stump was revealed after sending out the small branch (Figure 3(a)). Thereafter, we tried to treat the LCX-CTO. The middle LCX was occluded with a Rentrop grade 2 collateral flow from the posterolateral branch channel and the apical channel (Figure 3(b), Videos 1–2). However, interventional collateral channels were unclear.We started PCI with the antegrade approach. We engaged an SPB 3.0, 8Fr (ASAHI Intecc, Nagoya, Japan) in the left coronary artery and progressed with the XT-R (ASAHI Intecc) supported by Corsair Pro (ASAHI Intecc) into the CTO stump. However, stiff wires and the parallel wire technique resulted in subintimal wiring (Figure 4). We chose to convert to the retrograde approach. Tip injection revealed that the apical channel was connected to the posterolateral branch (Figure 5(a)). The SUOH 03 (ASAHI Intecc) passed the channel and bidirectional angiography revealed the short CTO length (Figure 5(b)), and the Gaia 2nd (ASAHI Intecc) directly crossed the CTO lesion (Figure 5(c)). Intravascular ultrasound imaging confirmed that the retrograde wire was in the true lumen (Figure 5(d)). However, a Mizuki (KANEKA MEDIX, Osaka, Japan) microcatheter could not pass the CTO lesion despite wire trapping by balloon catheter in the middle of the LCX. Even after the progression of the Gaia 2nd directly into the guiding catheter, the microcatheter could not pass the CTO lesion. Attempts were made to instead use the new Caravel microcatheter (ASAHI Intecc), which is thinner and has a softer body; however, it could not pass the CTO lesion as well. Thus, we planned to catch the retrograde wire with a snaring catheter, but that did not work. Therefore, we performed the rendezvous technique that meant full insertion of the retrograde Gaia 2nd into the antegrade Corsair Pro (Figure 6(a), Video 3). The antegrade Corsair Pro could advance into the CTO, tracking on the retrograde guidewire, but could not pass through the CTO completely (Figure 6(b)). Then, we tried the chasing wire technique, pushing the antegrade wire and pulling the retrograde wire simultaneously (Figure 7, Video 4). We chose the SION black (ASAHI Intecc) polymer jacket wire as an antegrade wire expecting smooth tracking along the route made by the retrograde guidewire before reocclusion. These techniques resulted in antegrade CTO crossing. We subsequently dilated the CTO with a small balloon and deployed the drug-eluting stent as usual (Figure 8, Videos 5–6).The CTO-PCI was developed along with novel techniques and devices [6, 7]. In particular, the bidirectional approach led to dramatic improvements in CTO-PCI success rates [5]. If interventionists established the bidirectional approach, some strategies, such as the direct retrograde guidewire crossing, kissing-wire technique, controlled antegrade and retrograde subintimal tracking (CART) technique [17, 18], or reverse CART technique [19], can be considered. After the retrograde guidewire has crossed the CTO lesion, the wire externalization can primarily be attempted and the retrograde microcatheter is required to reach the antegrade guiding catheter. Bidirectional approach for CTO-PCI with a single guiding catheter limits procedural choices in this situation. In the double guiding-catheter system, if the retrograde microcatheter could not track on the retrograde guidewire similar to our case, then (1) using a new microcatheter, (2) applying a guide-extension catheter, (3) performing wire trapping in the guiding catheter, or (4) catching the wire by snare catheter can be considered. Option 1 failed. Option 2, which utilized a small-sized catheter (e.g., 6Fr guide-extension catheter for 7Fr guiding catheter), was feasible, and the gap allowed the retrograde guidewire to progress in the antegrade guiding catheter; however, this was not considered at that time. In addition, options 3 and 4 are complicated when conducted via the bidirectional approach using the ipsilateral collaterals with the single guiding catheter. One solution could be the wire rendezvous technique and the chasing wire technique.The wire rendezvous technique was first reported by Kim et al. [20]. They reported that the antegrade and retrograde microcatheters were aligned in the same guiding catheter, and the antegrade guidewire advanced into the retrograde microcatheter and reached the distal CTO lumen. The difference in the current case was that the retrograde microcatheter could not pass the CTO lesion. Therefore, we were required to perform the rendezvous technique inside the guiding catheter. There are recommendations regarding this approach. The rendezvous point should be at the greater curvature of the guiding catheter in the aortic sinus or aortic arch. Furthermore, inserting the guidewire near the tip of the microcatheter suppresses the microcatheter motion. In addition, several antegrade penetrations resulted in a large antegrade false lumen, which complicated securing the true lumen. Therefore, the antegrade microcatheter tracked on the retrograde guidewire, and the tip of that reached into the CTO entry, but not through the CTO lesion. This guaranteed that the antegrade guidewire was able to penetrate the true lumen from the CTO entry. Therefore, Corsair microcatheter could be suitable as the antegrade microcatheter.To the best of our knowledge, the chasing wire technique has not been reported in the literature. The retrograde guidewire created a space with a width of 0.014 inches. Though this space might reocclude after wire retrieval, certain time lags could be expected. Therefore, we progressed the antegrade guidewire and pulled the retrograde guidewire simultaneously. The antegrade guidewire crossed the CTO through the space made by the retrograde guidewire. A polymer-coated wire, such as the SION black guidewire like our case, could be suitable as the antegrade wire because the surface of the CTO route might be narrow and rough. A tapered wire could also be appropriate in this situation, since the acute narrowing of the CTO route would occur after retrieving the retrograde guidewire.Although the above techniques are technically feasible, they should be considered as last resort techniques because of the risk of rapid reocclusion. Since we easily succeeded in the direct retrograde guidewire crossing, recrossing seemed possible if needed. However, a very long CTO or a CTO requiring the CART technique can be riskier. In such cases, we should consider switching to the double guiding-catheter system by puncturing another access site.Bidirectional approach for CTO-PCI using ipsilateral collaterals with single guiding catheter limits procedural choices. The wire rendezvous technique and the chasing wire technique might be possible solutions.This case was presented as an oral presentation in the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics in Asia Pan-pacific (TCTAP) National Meeting 2018 (http://www.summit-tctap.com/2018/submission_case_accept.php), as the Winner for Case Competition of Complex PCI.

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Iatrogenic coronary artery dissection is a potentially life-threatening complication of cardiovascular interventions. The optimal management of iatrogenic coronary artery dissection is not clear; however, both conservative management and percutaneous or surgical revascularization have been performed depending on the patient’s clinical status and the extent of dissection. We present the first reported case of right coronary artery dissection after Bentall procedure performed for ascending aortic aneurysm. Urgent percutaneous intervention using adjunctive coronary imaging was performed with excellent clinical recovery. In this article, we highlight coronary artery dissection after Bentall procedure as a possible complication, provide an insight into various options in its management, and review published data on iatrogenic coronary artery dissection. We also discuss the challenges in percutaneous treatment of coronary artery dissection with special focus on intracoronary imaging for accurate diagnosis and guidance in the management of this complex lesion.We present a 66-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension and chronic type A aortic dissection who was found to have an enlarging aortic root measuring 5.2 cm in diameter on an echocardiography done as part of surveillance of aortic dissection repair done 9 years ago using a tube graft with resuspension of the aortic valve (Figure 1). Echocardiography was followed by CT aortography that showed the aortic root measuring 6.0 cm × 5.4 cm in diameter. The patient denied any symptoms and an elective surgical reconstruction was planned. Preoperative coronary angiogram showed normal coronary arteries.The patient subsequently underwent modified Bentall procedure. This involved graft replacement of the aortic root, replacement of the aortic valve using a 27 mm bioprosthesis (St. Jude Medical Trifecta aortic bioprosthesis; St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA), and reimplantation of coronary arteries into the graft using the button technique. Soon after sternotomy closure was done, he was found in cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation intractable to pharmacologic resuscitation and defibrillation. Mediastinal reexploration was immediately performed revealing a fibrillating heart with no evidence of obvious bleeding or injury. He was internally defibrillated, and normal sinus rhythm was achieved. The patient was systemically heparinized and stabilized with vasopressors and veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). Urgent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was done that showed a new, severe dilatation of the right ventricle along with reduced ejection fraction but a normal left ventricle (Figure 2). The prosthetic aortic valve was intact.A concern for iatrogenic injury to the coronary vessels prompted an emergent coronary angiography which revealed dissection of the right coronary artery (RCA) extending from the ostium down to its distal segment, sparing the bifurcation (Figure 3; see Video 1 in Supplementary Materials). The left coronary artery was normal (see Video 2 in Supplementary Materials). A 6-French JR4 guiding catheter was placed in the ostium of the right coronary artery, and the dissection plane was traversed antegradely with a workhorse coronary guidewire (Prowater). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) using the Volcano Eagle Eye IVUS catheter was performed to ensure location of the wire in the true lumen distally, evaluate the nature and extent of coronary dissection, and select appropriate size of coronary artery stents. IVUS confirmed a spiral coronary dissection spanning between the distal RCA and ostium and sparing the right posterolateral and right posterior descending arteries (Figure 4). A 3.5 × 32 mm drug eluting stent (SYNERGY, Boston Scientific) was placed in the distal segment followed by four 4.0 mm drug eluting stents (SYNERGY, Boston Scientific) in overlapping fashion under IVUS guidance that restored TIMI-3 blood flow in the posterior descending and posterolateral branches of the right coronary artery (Figures 5(a), 5(b), and 6; see Videos 3–8 in Supplementary Materials).His postoperative course was also complicated by a right-sided pneumothorax which required chest tube drainage and nonoliguric renal failure that were managed conservatively. The patient’s clinical status showed marked improvement, and by the fourth day postsurgery, he was extubated and weaned off from hemodynamic support. A transthoracic echocardiography one week later showed improved right ventricular size and function (Figure 7). The patient was subsequently transferred to rehab hospital where he had an uneventful six weeks of cardiac rehabilitation. He was subsequently discharged home in a stable condition. He has been doing well on follow-up.The Bentall procedure for management of aortic root dilatation was first described in 1968 by Bentall and De Bono. This involves surgical replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve with composite tubular graft containing a prosthetic valve followed by reimplantation of coronary arteries into holes punched in the graft [1]. The Bentall procedure has remained the procedure of choice for aortic root replacement with a reported survival of 91.7% at 10 years [2]. The classical Bentall procedure carries a risk of postoperative hemorrhage and pseudoaneurysm formation [3, 4]. Over the years, improvements and modifications have been proposed to minimize complications [5–7]. Button reimplantation that involves removal of a full-thickness “button” of the aorta surrounding the coronary ostia and implanting them into the openings made in the vascular graft is one technique that has yielded excellent results [6, 8]. The disadvantages of this technique include longer time required for dissecting out the coronary ostia, especially the ostium of the left coronary artery, and the risk of damage or occlusion of the left main coronary artery, the circumflex artery, or the first septal perforator branch [6]. Moreover, with this technique, mobilization of the coronary ostia is difficult and may require additional sutures to the left coronary ostial anastomosis to obtain hemostasis [6].Reports regarding coronary artery dissection after the Bentall procedure are lacking in literature. We describe the first reported case of RCA dissection after the Bentall procedure. We think that coronary artery dissection in our case was probably related to either mechanical injury during excision and reimplantation of the coronary buttons or from instrumentation at the time of administration of cardioplegics into the coronary arteries [9].We performed literature review in PubMed using the search strategy “Iatrogenic[Title] AND Coronary[Title] AND Dissection[Title].” This yielded 82 articles; out of which, 38 articles had detailed information on the type of management strategy for each patient with iatrogenic coronary artery dissection and thus were selected for review. Four of these articles were case series studies, and the rest were case reports. We identified a total of 48 patients who suffered iatrogenic coronary artery dissection (ICAD), 30 (62.5%) of which were females. The age group with the most number of patients reported (i.e., 29.2%) was 61–70 years. 47 patients developed ICAD as a result of coronary angiography whereas only one patient developed ICAD after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure. We did not find any case of ICAD resulting from the Bentall procedure. 41 patients had some form of intervention either with stent placement (33 patients), CABG (6 patients), or both (2 patients) whereas only 6 patients had conservative treatment as part of the management of ICAD. One patient died before any management strategy could be instituted. Dissection occurred in the left coronary circulation in 32 (66.7%) and right coronary circulation in 16 (33.3%) patients. Intracoronary imaging with either intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) was employed in 15 patients for evaluation and guidance in management. These findings are summarized in Table 1. The details of the 38 selected articles are provided in tabulated form as a supplementary item with this review (see “Articles selected in systemic review” in Supplementary Materials).The diagnosis of coronary artery dissection with angiography alone can be arduous since an angiogram is a two-dimensional luminogram and does not image the arterial wall that is affected in coronary dissection [10]. Thus, advanced imaging techniques in addition to angiography are needed for accurately diagnosing and guiding management [10]. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are two such diagnostic modalities considered gold standard in accurately diagnosing coronary dissection [10–12]. IVUS allows a deeper and longer assessment of vessels thus enabling adequate visualization and better appreciation of the extent of intramural hematoma as compared to OCT [10, 13]. This is because of insufficient optical penetration and shadowing associated with OCT [13]. However, OCT has a higher spatial resolution and is superior to IVUS in detecting intimal tears, false lumen, and also intramural hematomas [13]. Amongst noninvasive imaging studies, multislice computed tomography (MSCT) is an attractive modality that can detect a double-barreled coronary lumen or low-density signal surrounding the lumen in an intraluminal hematoma; however, its utility is limited by low spatial resolution that may diagnose proximal but not the distal vessel involvement [14, 15].The overall management of ICAD is often dependent on operator discretion and other clinical and patient variables including the severity of dissection and hemodynamic stability. A wide variety of management strategies that include conservative management, percutaneous intervention (PCI), emergent coronary artery bypass grafting, thrombolytic therapy, and cardiac transplantation have been done [16–19]. However, percutaneous approach is still the preferred and the quickest way to restore coronary flow and improve hemodynamics in cases of ongoing ischemia [16, 20–25]. Treatment of coronary artery dissection with percutaneous intervention is challenging. In one study, 28 (65%) amongst 43 patients who underwent PCI for spontaneous coronary artery dissection had technical success [26].There are multiple reasons for suboptimal results associated with PCI in coronary artery dissection. First, with dissection, it is difficult to advance a guidewire into the true lumen [27]. Second, there is a risk of extension of the intramural hematoma in the forward or backward direction during the procedure that may further jeopardize coronary blood flow [27]. Moreover, depending on the location of the dissection, stent deployment may be a demanding task [27]. A dissection in a small vessel may not be amenable to stent placement whereas a larger dissection even if stented carries a risk of malapposition after the intramural hematoma has resorbed over time [27]. More often than not, the dissection can be extensive, requiring longer stents and thus increasing the risk of in-stent restenosis [27].Some authors have recommended percutaneous intervention techniques to improve results in patients with coronary artery dissection. In case of a relatively focal lesion, selection of a longer stent that spans across both the proximal and distal edges of the lesion would be preferable [28]. This will prevent extension of the intramural hematoma [28]. In cases of longer lesions, deploying stent in the distal segment followed by the proximal area and then the middle segment of the dissection in order to prevent propagation of intramural hematoma has been advocated [28].Intracoronary imaging modalities can be of great value in guiding successful PCI. IVUS and OCT can be used to identify true lumen, intimal tears and extent of the dissection, and intramural hematoma. They can ensure proper placement of guidewire in the true lumen and help in selecting the appropriate size of coronary stent and its optimal deployment [29, 30]. Intracoronary imaging can also verify adequate obliteration of the false lumen and compression of the intramural hematoma after the stent has been placed [29, 30]. Thus, in cases where there is suspicion of iatrogenic coronary artery dissection, we strongly recommend IVUS as an important adjunct to achieve high technical success rate while treating such complex lesions.Iatrogenic right coronary artery dissection should be considered in patients with ventricular fibrillation and acute right ventricular dilatation after Bentall procedure. Percutaneous intervention along with intracoronary imaging is a useful strategy to accurately diagnose and guide revascularization in these cases.The authors report no financial relationships or conflicts of interest regarding the content herein.(1) Spiral right coronary artery dissection (Video 1).

Electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, and T wave inversions in the lateral leads. Initial cardiac troponin level was 0.15 ng/ml, with levels of 4 ng/ml and 9 ng/ml obtained 6 and 12 hours later, respectively. The peak blood pressure recorded was 195/43 mmHg. Echocardiogram with DEFINITY showed a small left ventricular cavity with apical hypertrophy, and coronary angiogram showed no stenotic or occluding lesions in the coronary arteries. The patient was admitted for a type 2 myocardial infarction with hypertensive crises. She was diagnosed with having apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in which the hypertrophy predominantly involves the apex of the left ventricle resulting in midventricular obstruction, as opposed to the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction seen in HCM. Patients with apical HCM may present with angina, heart failure, myocardial infarction, syncope, or arrhythmias and are typically managed with medications like verapamil and beta-blockers for those who have symptoms and antiarrhythmic agents like amiodarone and procainamide for treatment of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is recommended for high-risk HCM patients with a history of previous cardiac arrest or sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia, syncope, and a family history of sudden death.There are several causes of troponin elevation other than acute coronary syndromes. Some of the common noncoronary ischemia-related causes include chronic renal failure, advanced heart failure, acute pulmonary embolism, acute inflammatory myocarditis, and coronary artery vasospasm. Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the rare cardiomyopathies which can also present like an acute myocardial infarction (MI). We present a case of 66-year-old female who presented with chest pain to our emergency room and was found to have apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.A 66-year-old independently functioning woman presented to the emergency room with an episode of midepigastric and left sternal chest pain. Her medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glaucoma, and multiple previous episodes of chest pain similar to her current episode that necessitated three separate coronary angiograms which showed no stenotic or occluding lesions in the coronary arteries. The patient described her chest pain as a sensation of burning that started suddenly at 11 pm in the night while she was resting comfortably at home after having dinner. The pain was mild in intensity, nonradiating, and lasted for a few minutes before resolving spontaneously. She denied having any dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, or loss of consciousness during this episode. She had no history of smoking or illicit drug use. Her home medications included felodipine extended release 5 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate extended release 30 mg once daily, atorvastatin 80 mg once daily, losartan 100 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, and metoprolol succinate extended release 100 mg once daily. The patient activated emergency medical services immediately after onset of her symptoms, who brought the patient to the emergency room. On arrival in the emergency room, the patient was asymptomatic. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 168/46 mmHg (right arm, supine position), heart rate of 66/min, respiratory rate of 19/min, and an oral temperature of 97.9 F. An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed a normal sinus cardiac rhythm with a left bundle branch block, possible left ventricular hypertrophy, and T wave inversions in the lateral leads. No ST segment changes were noted (Figure 1). There were no prior electrocardiograms available for comparison. Her laboratory data included a cardiac troponin level of 0.15 ng/ml. Follow-up cardiac troponin levels obtained 6 and 12 hours later were 4 ng/ml and 9 ng/ml, respectively. The patient continued to be asymptomatic during this time, and a follow-up EKG showed no changes compared to the first EKG (Figure 2). Her blood pressure, however, continued to remain high during her time in the emergency room with a peak blood pressure recording of 195/43 mmHg. Based on the elevated troponin level up to 9 ng/ml with the absence of ST segment changes on the EKG and the significantly elevated blood pressure, it was decided to admit the patient to the cardiac intensive care unit for treatment of a hypertensive crisis with elevated troponin levels possibly due to a type 2 myocardial infarction. She was given a loading dose of aspirin 325 mg and clopidogrel 300 mg orally and was started on an intravenous heparin drip at 12 units/kg/hour. A onetime dose of hydralazine 5 mg was administered intravenously which was followed by an improvement in the blood pressure to 150/46 mmHg. An echocardiogram was ordered with DEFINITY which showed a small left ventricular cavity with apical hypertrophy, an impaired relaxation pattern during left ventricular diastolic filling, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 76–80%. The patient subsequently underwent a coronary angiogram the next day through right femoral artery access which showed normal left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries with no stenotic or occluding lesions (Figure 3). A cardiac left ventriculogram was done by cardiac chamber catheterization during the procedure, which confirmed the echocardiographic finding of apical hypertrophy (Figure 4). Based on the finding of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, it was decided to start the patient on metoprolol succinate extended release 100 mg daily and verapamil sustained release 180 mg daily. The remainder of the patient’s hospitalization was uneventful, with an optimally controlled blood pressure and a downtrend in her cardiac troponin levels, and she was subsequently discharged on the 3rd hospital day.Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in which the hypertrophy of the myocardium predominantly involves the apex of the left ventricle resulting in midventricular obstruction, as opposed to the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction seen in HCM [1–3]. It occurs due to autosomal dominant mutations in one of nine genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, most commonly the sarcomere gene ACTC 1 (actin, alpha, cardiac muscle 1)—Glu101Lys missense mutation [4, 5]. Apical HCM is also known as Yamaguchi syndrome after the person who first described its imaging features in Japan and is more common in East Asian populations—representing 41 percent of Chinese patients with HCM and 15 percent of Japanese patients, but only 1–3 percent of non-Asian populations with HCM [1, 6–8]. The mean age at presentation has been variable in different studies, it was 41.4 ± 14.5 years in one study [3] and 58 ± 17 years in another [9]. Most patients with apical HCM are asymptomatic, and those who do develop symptoms usually present with angina, heart failure, myocardial infarction, presyncope, syncope, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular fibrillation. These occur usually due to diastolic dysfunction with low cardiac output [3]. The typical clinical and diagnostic features of apical HCM include audible fourth heart sound, “giant” negative T waves on EKG, particularly in left precordial leads, apical wall motion abnormalities including hypokinesis and aneurysm formation, and “spade-like” configuration of left ventricular cavity at end-diastole on imaging [3, 10, 11]. Among these findings, the “giant” negative T wave has been identified as a predictor of favorable outcome [8]. The diagnosis of apical HCM can be made with echocardiography, left ventriculography, computed tomography, or most accurately with cardiac MRI [1, 12, 13]. Lladó et al. showed that MRI allowed better overall assessment of the degree and extent of LVH in HCM patients than did echocardiogram [12]. The apical segment was adequately visualized in all patients by MRI but only in 60% of the patients by echo, and MRI allows the early diagnosis of apical HCM by identifying even a small quantity of hypertrophied myocardium in different apical locations in a “nonspade” variety of apical HCM [12, 14]. While apical HCM has a better mortality prognosis than other forms of HCM, with one retrospective study of 105 patients having a total cardiovascular mortality rate of 1.9% over 13.6 ± 8.3 years [3] and overall estimated survival of 95 percent at 15 years, it is still associated with a relatively high rate of important cardiac events—30 percent of patients experienced a serious cardiac complication, most commonly atrial fibrillation (12 percent) or a myocardial infarction (10 percent) [3]. In the same study, apical myocardial infarction in the presence of normal coronary arteries, a presentation similar to the patient in our case, was found in about 10% of patients. The possible mechanisms responsible for ischemia in apical HCM include limitation in coronary flow reserve, decreased capillary myocardial ratio, small vessel disease, and other mechanisms [15–17]. Severe clinical manifestations, including sudden cardiac death, severe arrhythmias, and apical infarction with apical aneurysm, are uncommon with apical HCM, although they have been described [3]. Among the subtypes of HCM, the “true apical” phenotype (hypertrophy of only the apical segments) has been shown to have improved survival over a “distal-dominant” phenotype (cases in which hypertrophy extended into the middle LV segments) [18]. In another study of 193 patients in Minnesota, the observed versus expected 20-year survival was 47% versus 60% [9]. Sudden cardiac death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and/or defibrillator discharge was observed in 6% of patients during follow-up.While apical HCM is low on the list of suspected differentials for patients presenting with chest pain and elevated cardiac troponin levels on laboratory testing, the more common causes of such a presentation being STEMI or NSTEMI, this case still demonstrates the importance of following the proper testing protocol for patients who present with these findings to the emergency room—namely, an EKG, followed by testing for cardiac troponin levels, a bedside echocardiogram, and an urgent coronary angiogram if EKG changes are seen along with elevated cardiac troponin levels. For patients with no EKG changes and elevation in cardiac troponin levels, they should still be treated as an NSTEMI with anticoagulation and an early coronary angiogram preferably within 24 hours of presentation, especially if they have clinical findings that are strongly suggestive of an NSTEMI, i.e., symptoms of ischemic chest pain on presentation and prior risk factors of coronary artery disease.The approach to the management of apical HCM is the same as for most patients with HCM; symptomatic patients are initially treated with medical therapy, which includes medications like verapamil and beta-blockers [3, 19, 20]. Antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone and procainamide are used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias [21]. Since apical HCM does not involve LVOT obstruction, septal reduction therapy is almost never used to treat apical HCM. Similarly, the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death is low in apical HCM, and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is only recommended for high risk HCM patients with a history of previous cardiac arrest or sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia, syncope, a family history of sudden death, or episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on serial Holter monitoring [22].Apical HCM is a variant of HCM in which the hypertrophy of the myocardium predominantly involves the apex of the left ventricle resulting in midventricular obstruction, as opposed to the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction seen in HCM. While apical HCM has a better mortality prognosis than other forms of HCM, it is still associated with a relatively high rate of important cardiac events like atrial fibrillation or myocardial infarction.

Electrocardiographic changes imitating myocardial ischemia have been occasionally reported in patients with intra-abdominal pathology including acute pancreatitis. Case Report. A 60-year-old man with no past medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) after a syncopal episode. In ED, his vitals were stable. His ECG showed sinus bradycardia at 53 beats per minute, peaked T waves, 1 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, and 2 mm ST elevation in V3 as shown in the figures. With the concern for STEMI, he was taken for left heart catheterization (LHC) emergently, showing nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). His laboratory workup was remarkable for lipase of 25,304 IU/l (normal level 8–78 IU/l). His liver function test and triglyceride level were normal. Troponin was <0.01 ng/ml. A computed tomographic exam of the abdomen revealed acute interstitial pancreatitis with a small discrete fluid collection in the uncinate process. He was treated with aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and was discharged on day 3. Discussion. Intra-abdominal pathologies like acute pancreatitis can lead to transient ECG changes mimicking STEMI. It is important to use ECG clues, echocardiographic findings, and clinical judgement to avoid cardiac catheterization, contrast exposure, and associated health care costs.Transient electrocardiographic changes imitating myocardial ischemia have been occasionally reported in patients with intra-abdominal pathology including acute pancreatitis. The occurrence of ST elevation in a patient presenting with syncope is a cause for concern and should be evaluated emergently to rule out cardiac etiology. We present a case of syncope with inferior ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram who was diagnosed to have acute pancreatitis.A 60-year-old Asian male with past medical history of glaucoma presented to the emergency department (ED) after a syncopal episode. The patient was seated at his workplace when he suddenly felt moderate epigastric pain and slumped down in his chair, after which he lost consciousness. The bystanders caught him while falling to the ground from his chair. He denied a previous episode of syncope and denied having chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, or vomiting. He was a nonsmoker and had occasional alcohol intake.In ED, his blood pressure was 125/58 mmHg, heart rate 55 beats per minute, regular, he was afebrile, and saturated 100% on room air. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia at 53 beats per minute, peaked T waves, 1 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, and 2 mm ST elevation in V3 (Figure 1). With the concern for ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI), he was given aspirin 324 mg and was taken for left heart catheterization (LHC) emergently. His LHC showed nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). His laboratory workup was remarkable for lipase of 25,304 IU/l (normal level 8–78 IU/l) and white blood count 11,800/mcl. His liver function test, serum electrolyte level, and triglyceride level were unremarkable. Troponin was <0.01 ng/ml. A computed tomographic exam of the abdomen revealed acute interstitial pancreatitis with a small discrete fluid collection in the uncinate process (Figure 2). The ultrasound of his abdomen ruled out biliary etiology, showing a normal appearance of the gallbladder and biliary tree, without evidence of calculus or obstruction. His echocardiogram revealed normal ejection fraction with no regional wall motion abnormality.He was admitted to the telemetry floor and treated with aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. He was symptomatically better the following day and could tolerate a diet on day 3. He was discharged on day 3 with adequate follow-up. The discharging ECG is shown in Figure 3. His initial syncopal episode was thought to be a vasovagal response either due to epigastric pain or intravascular volume depletion from having severe pancreatitis.ST-segment elevation on ECG is commonly seen in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, few clinical entities simulate myocardial injury on the ECG. These include noncoronary cardiac pathologies such as pericarditis and myocarditis, vascular pathologies such as aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism, electrolyte abnormalities such as hyperkalaemia, acute intra-abdominal pathologies such as acute cholecystitis and acute pancreatitis, and miscellaneous causes including intracranial bleeds or infarction, pregnancy, limb lead reversal, hypothermia, amyloidosis, medication effects (e.g., digitalis), and illicit drug effects [1–4]. Acute pancreatitis can present like ACS with epigastric or substernal chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and syncope, making the diagnosis confusing, more so in the presence of ST-segment elevation with a concern for ischemia.ECG abnormalities in acute pancreatitis have been described for more than 50 years. The incidence is unclear, but prior studies have shown ECG changes in around 50% of patients with acute pancreatitis [5, 6]. Rubio-Tapia et al. evaluated the ECGs of 51 patients that presented with acute pancreatitis and without preexisting heart diseases, and they found abnormal ECG findings in 55% of these patients. Within the ECG abnormalities, repolarization abnormality (20%), tachycardia (12%), and left anterior hemiblock (10%) were the most common. The most likely cause of these abnormalities was electrolyte disturbances [5]. There are few case reports describing STEMI as a complication of acute pancreatitis [7], and there are rare reports of STEMI-like ECG changes in a patient with acute pancreatitis without ACS [8, 9].The following hypotheses have been proposed to explain these ST-segment abnormalities in ECG: (1) Hypovolemia and hypotension can cause coronary hypoperfusion especially in patients with significant coronary artery disease [10]. (2) Electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia can modify the repolarization phase on ECG [6]. (3) There is direct damage of myocytes secondary to proteolytic enzymes, such as trypsin. This can modify the permeability of the membrane, cause direct membrane injury, and induce necrosis generating an electrical disturbance and ECG abnormalities [11–13]. (4) Vasovagal stimulus secondary to the acute intra-abdominal disease can cause a cardiobiliary reflex. This vagal stimulation can cause cardiac electrical and mechanical disturbances presenting as bradycardia, AV block, hypotension, and syncope [13, 14]. (5) Other conditions, including coagulopathy, exacerbation of underlying cardiac disease, and coronary vasospasm [5], as well as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, can also be present in acute cases of pancreatitis [15, 16].Echocardiographic evaluation of patients with chest or epigastric pain with ECG changes suggestive of acute ischemia can be helpful to determine the etiology of the symptoms. Wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram is an important finding to determine possible ischemia, though its absence does not always rule out ischemia. In patients with acute pancreatitis, transient regional wall motion abnormalities have been described in the past in the absence of coronary ischemia. These can be related to myocardial stunning. This stunning could be the result of transient coronary thrombosis or coronary vasospasm [17]. Angiographic findings in patients with pancreatitis and in patients with ST-segment elevation on ECG have shown normal coronaries in most cases [18].Electrocardiographic changes are often noted in acute pancreatitis, though ST elevation is rarely noted. It is important to use ECG clues, echocardiographic findings, and clinical judgement to avoid cardiac catheterization, contrast exposure, and associated health care costs. Awareness of this presentation can avoid the erroneous administration of thrombolytic agents, especially in hospitals not equipped with catheterization suites, which may have fatal consequences [19]. Evaluation for noncoronary causes of ST-segment elevation might sometimes be necessary before pursuing further testing and invasive procedures.Informed patient consent was obtained for publication of the case details.An abstract of this manuscript titled “Acute pancreatitis mimicking ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction in a patient with syncope” was presented at the International Academy of Cardiology, Annual Scientific Sessions 2018 in Boston on July 28th, 2018.None of the authors have any conflicts of interest.
A Rare Case of Complete Fragmentation of Pacemaker Lead after a High-Velocity Theme Park Ride
East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Furqan Khattak; ude.uste@kattahKReceived 20 February 2018; Revised 6 June 2018; Accepted 28 August 2018; Published 18 October 2018Academic Editor: Domingo A. Pascual-FigalCopyright © 2018 Furqan Khattak et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Pacemaker lead fracture is one of the most common causes of pacemaker malfunction and is most frequently associated with weight lifting or chest trauma. These patients usually present with symptoms of dizziness, syncope, chest discomfort, and palpitations or less commonly with extracardiac symptoms. Diagnosis is made by ECG and careful review of chest imaging such as chest X-ray or fluoroscopy. Treatment involves placement of a new lead with or without extraction of the fractured lead. We present an interesting case of complete severance of the tip of a dual-chamber pacemaker’s atrial lead after a high-velocity theme park ride. In our case, the fracture occurred during amusement park rides and went undiagnosed until the patient presented for routine pacemaker evaluation. This case indicates that extreme physical forces in the absence of direct trauma, such as during amusement park rides, may result in lead fractures and patients with pacemakers should be cautioned regarding such activities.Pacemaker lead fracture is one of the most common causes of pacemaker malfunction. Lead fractures are seen in approximately 0.1 to 4.2% of patients with pacemakers per year. Lead fractures are most commonly associated with physical exertion during weight lifting or chest trauma. Subclavian crush syndrome is one of the most commonly reported causes of traumatic pacemaker fractures. Stress or trauma due to physical exertion causes compression of a lead between the clavicle and first rib when implanted by subclavian approach. In our patient's case, fracture of a pacemaker lead occurred during accelerated rides in the absence of direct trauma.A 62-year-old male with history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and sick sinus syndrome presented to outpatient device check clinic to establish care for a pacemaker device. He underwent implantation of a dual-chamber pacemaker device (St. Jude Accent generator with Medtronic CapSure SP Novus atrial and ventricular leads) in 2002 for sick sinus syndrome and had a generator changeout in 2011. The lead model was not implicated in a recall to our knowledge and search. The patient had his last device check performed in March 2017, and no problems with the device function were reported at that time. The patient denied any trauma to the chest or upper extremities, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncopal episodes. He denied any device-related complications in the past. The patient reported a recent visit to a popular theme park in the 1st week of August, where he enjoyed multiple high thrill rides including high-velocity roller coaster rides. On physical examination, he was afebrile with normal pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. His left pectoral pacemaker implant site showed no erythema, swelling, warmth, drainage, or signs of erosion. Labs showed normal blood counts and normal renal and liver function. A 12-lead ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute and atrial pacing spikes with loss of capture (Figure 1). Pacemaker device evaluation showed approximate remaining battery life of 9 years and programmed DDDR pacing mode. Heart rate histograms showed 54% atrial pacing and 15% ventricular pacing. The right ventricular lead showed normal sensing, impedance, and pacing threshold. The right atrial lead was noted to have unusually high impedance of 2175 ohms and no capture on testing at voltages as high as 7.5 mV. Lead impedance history clearly showed an abrupt increase in the atrial lead impedance in August, at the time patient had visited the theme park, from around 600 ohms to 1000 ohms and subsequently above 2000 ohms (Figure 2). EGM showed atrial lead noise. A chest X-ray (CXR) was obtained which revealed an intact right ventricular lead and complete severance of the right atrial lead tip (Figures 3 and 4). The pacemaker was reprogrammed from DDDR to VVIR mode. After discussion and review with the patient, it was decided not to retrieve the fractured lead or insert a new atrial lead, due to his intrinsic sinus rhythm having taken over, no evidence of atrioventricular (AV) block, and no current requirement for pacing. It was decided to follow the patient clinically to see if he will require insertion of an atrial lead in future.Pacemaker devices play an important role in the management of bradyarrhythmias, however, postimplantation complications can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Complications may occur during implant procedure, or, from pocket complications, generator malfunction, or lead failures. Pacemaker leads are considered the weakest link in this chain. Previous studies have reported lead-related complications such as lead dislodgement or lead damage during implantation, electrical failure, and lead fracture due to chest trauma or insulation defects in different pacemaker devices. Studies have also shown the benefit of postimplantation chest X-ray to look for immediate implantation-related complications, perforation, and malposition of leads. Early lead perforation is a rare complication of device implantation in the right atrium or right ventricle (0.1–0.8%) and occurs within one month of implantation. Delayed lead perforation occurs after the first month and is usually differentiated from early perforation by the absence of cardiac tamponade related to lead perforation. Lead fractures are seen with an incidence rate of 0.1 to 4.2% per patient year [1]. The most common site of lead fracture is at the site of entry (40%) followed by the area between the entry site and generator (28%) and lastly close to the generator site (23%). Only 7% are intravascular fractures [1]. Tricuspid valve has been reported as an unusual site of pacemaker lead fracture [2].Most lead fractures occur in the pacemaker pocket or between clavicle and the first rib mainly due to compression of a lead lateral to the entry site between soft tissues muscles and ligaments. Pacemaker lead fracture due to physical exertion is an uncommon albeit recognized cause of lead malfunction. [3]. Few cases of traumatic lead fracture due to blunt chest trauma [4] and weight lifting due to crush injuries between clavicle and the first rib have been reported [5]. Subclavian crush syndrome is one of the most commonly reported causes of traumatic pacemaker fractures.Studies have shown that fracture rate of multifilar coil leads is less than the single filar coil leads [6]. Lead fracture depends on factors such as coil diameter, radius of curvature, and approach used for implantation, with more fractures occurring with internal jugular vein approach than external jugular or cephalic vein approach. Usually, lead fracture is associated with high impedance, but there have been cases reported with normal impedance in multifilar coil lead fracture resulting from subclavian crush syndrome. The mechanism behind low impedance was a connection between inner and outer coil [7]. A case of lead fracture due to cardiac fibroma was also reported with low impedance [8]. Another case has been reported about loss of atrial pacing with possible atrial mode switch due to atrial oversensing in a patient with atrial arrhythmias [9].Patients with a lead fracture may present with symptoms of dizziness, syncope, chest discomfort, and palpitations or less commonly extracardiac symptoms like hiccups or maybe completely asymptomatic as in our patient. Diagnosis is often made by ECG and careful review of chest imaging such as chest X-ray or fluoroscopy. Treatment involves placement of a new lead with or without extraction of the fractured lead. The decision regarding extraction of the old lead is individualized considering the age of the lead and expected fibrosis. Often, the old lead is capped and left alone to avoid complications of lead extraction such as arrhythmias and cardiac perforation.Leadless pacemakers are now becoming available in the US market, and Micra, the first leadless pacemaker device, has been approved by FDA. Leadless devices implanted by transcatheter approach may theoretically reduce complications related to device implantation and those related to lead itself. This may be the future of pacing in suitable candidates who require only single chamber (right ventricle) pacing [10].Our case is unusual to begin with as our patient had a dual-chamber pacemaker implanted for sick sinus syndrome at the age of 46 years; however, he did not show any progression to AV block after 16 years which is uncommon for molecular abnormalities of ion channel/cardiac proteins which usually undergo significant evolution to bradycardia/AV block with time. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first case of a pacemaker lead fracture associated with a theme park ride and indicates that widely popular high-velocity theme park rides may pose risks to pacemaker leads. We hypothesize that the sheer stress generated by extreme acceleration and gravitational forces on a wire that is moving with cardiac cycle during the high-velocity rides may cause fracture even in the absence of direct physical trauma. The site of fracture in this case, which is a transition from ring to tip electrode of the atrial lead, rules out any possible role of surrounding skeletal structures, such as in cases of rib/clavicle/pocket fractures. The lack of previous chest X-ray in our center precluded the comparison between the current lead position and the position at implantation, which in fact could influence the fracture. Therefore, it cannot be inferred whether the lead tip was at the anterior-lateral location as the X-ray shows or if it migrated to this location after the lead body was snapped in two parts. This case may have important clinical implications such as the need for caution with theme park rides, and routine pacemaker interrogations after such visits especially in pacemaker-dependent patients. Luckily, our patient remained unharmed as he had intact intrinsic AV nodal conduction and required infrequent atrial pacing. Moreover, at the time of presentation, he had intrinsic sinus activity and intact AV nodal conduction and the failed atrial pacing programmed at 60 bpm was redundant.Authors report no conflict of interest in this case report.

The potassium level rose to 5.6–5.7 mEq/L with metoprolol and normalized when the agent was discontinued. However, the potassium level rose again to 5.6 mEq/L after the administration of carvedilol but the level normalized by halving the dose. The observations of hyperkalemia induced by two different β-blocker drugs in the same patient confirm that this side effect is common to all β-blocker drugs.Hyperkalemia is a rare side effect of β-blocker drugs [1–3]. In this report, we describe the occurrence of metoprolol-induced hyperkalemia in a patient with type 2 diabetes and stage III renal dysfunction. The potassium level normalized after metoprolol was discontinued, but the administration of carvedilol subsequently induced hyperkalemia. The development of hyperkalemia in the same patient induced by two different β-blocker drugs has not been previously reported.An 81-year-old man presented with asymptomatic of hyperkalemia (5.7 mEq/L). The past history included mitral valve repair and coronary bypass surgery 27 years previously, mild type II diabetes for 12 years, renal insufficiency (stage III) with a stable creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL for 8 years and prostatic hypertrophy. An echocardiogram performed 6 months previously revealed normal left ventricular function and minimal mitral regurgitation and an ECG documented sinus rhythm and complete left bundle branch block. Medications included Avodart 0.5 mg qd, atorvastatin 80 mg qd, aspirin 325 mg qd, Januvia 25 mg qd, and metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid. The latter had been prescribed 6 years previously for frequent symptomatic atrial premature beats with an excellent clinical result so that metoprolol at the same dose (all tartrate preparation) was continued up to the most recent evaluation. The potassium level had always been normal before the administration of metoprolol. Afterwards, routine testing with serum electrolytes every 6 or 12 months consistently revealed a potassium level of 5.4 mEq/L. Then, for the last 2 years regular routine testing revealed a potassium level fluctuating between 5.6 and 5.7 mEq/L. Finally, metoprolol was discontinued and 18 days later the potassium level normalized at 4.2 mEq/L. Carvedilol was started and then increased to 12.5 mg bid. After about 10 days on this dose, the potassium level increased to 5.6 mEq/L. The dose of carvedilol was therefore reduced to 6.25 mg bid. A follow-up potassium level 2 weeks after the start of the lower carvedilol dose was 5.0 mEq/L which is at the upper limit of normal for the testing laboratory.β-Blocker-induced hyperkalemia is a rare nonspecific side effect of β-blocker therapy as illustrated by the effect from two different β-blockers in the same patient. It appears from a review of the literature that a biological difference between the 2 available forms of metoprolol, tartrate or succinate, is unlikely.A 2018 FDA report evaluated the incidence of hyperkalemia (level not stated) in 24,296 patients taking metoprolol succinate and found 287 patients with hyperkalemia [4]. The patients with hyperkalemia were taking ramipil (41.5%) or spironolactone (10.4%). No other potassium-retaining drugs were taken. An increased creatinine was present in 20.56% and acute renal failure in 33.80% of the patients. The FDA report suggests that metoprolol-induced hyperkalemia occurs in about 0.5% of the patients without acute renal failure and can occur in patients without diabetes or renal dysfunction. Yet, there are only two Medline citations about this side effect of metoprolol. One case involved a 45-year-old hypertensive diabetic man with advanced renal failure on hemodialysis who developed marked recurrent hyperkalemia while on metoprolol therapy (full preparation not stated) [1]. The other case documented hyperkalemia as a result of a suicide with metoprolol [5].Propranolol has rarely been reported to induce hyperkalemia in the adult patient, though it is well documented as a serious problem when it is used to treat hemangiomas in infants [3, 6, 7].In our case, the potassium level rose to 5.6 mEq/L when the patient (with type III renal insufficiency) was on carvedilol 12.5 mg bid but it normalized (though at the upper limit of normal—5 mEq/L) when the dose of carvedilol was reduced to 6.25 mg bid. A similar observation was recently reported about carvedilol-induced hyperkalemia in a 69-year-old man with hypertension, type II diabetes, and stage III renal insufficiency who was hospitalized for abdominal pain [2]. He had been on carvedilol 3.125 mg bid and lisinopril 40 mg qd. The serum potassium was 4.8 mEq/L. When carvedilol was increased to 6.25 mg bid, the serum potassium rose to 6.7 mEq/L without any change in lisinopril dosage or administration of other potassium-retaining drugs. A simple reduction back to the original dose normalized the potassium level [2]. These two reports suggest that the development of hyperkalemia is dose dependent.Intravenous labetalol has been associated with severe hyperkalemia for the treatment of acute hypertension in hemodialysis patients, renal transplant patients, and in preeclampsia [8–10].Severe hyperkalemia occurred in a patient with glaucoma following the use of timolol maleate eyedrops, but the serum potassium level normalized upon discontinuation of the eyedrops [11]. However, hyperkalemia recurred following a rechallenge with the same eyedrops and the potassium level normalized again when the eyedrops were withdrawn.It is well known that adrenergic agents decrease serum potassium and hence are used to treat life-threatening hyperkalemia. β2 adrenergic agonists drive potassium into the cells by increasing the activity of the Na-K pump. Thus, a catecholamine surge tends to lower the serum potassium [12]. They also activate the inwardly directed Na-K-Cl cotransporter, a protein that aids in the active transport of sodium, potassium, and chloride into cells [12]. Yet, the opposite effect with the production of hyperkalemia by the inhibition of the sympathetic system as with β-blockers has only occasionally been reported. The propensity to hyperkalemia may be masked or unrecognized because β-blockers are commonly administered together with drugs that affect potassium balance.Barring the acute administration of a β-blocker drug, there are only 4 well-documented case reports of β-blocker-induced hyperkalemia from sustained therapy (3 from the literature and one described herein). Three cases had associated renal dysfunction and diabetes, while one had none of these associations. Insulin similar to epinephrine enhances the activity of the Na-K pump so that an anti-insulin effect in diabetes would favor the movement of potassium outside the cells [12]. Renal insufficiency decreases the cell membrane potential and thus leads to translocation of potassium to the extracellular fluid [13]. The above clinical cases confirm the FDA data that renal insufficiency is a strong predisposing factor to the development of β-blocker-induced hyperkalemia. These cases also suggest a probable association with diabetes, though the FDA data revealed a 10% incidence perhaps because of a different patient population. Finally, it is possible that hyperkalemia may be due to a genetic predisposition.We have reported metoprolol-induced and carvedilol-induced hyperkalemia. Such hyperkalemia is rare and seems to be a common side effect of β-blockers. Hyperkalemia is more common in patients with renal insufficiency and probably in those with diabetes. Identification of this form of hyperkalemia may avoid unnecessary investigations and prevent untoward effects. In patients with stable renal insufficiency, β-blocker-induced hyperkalemia should not be attributed to progression of kidney disease causing unwarranted alarm and inappropriate therapy. This form of hyperkalemia may be dose dependent so that normalization of the potassium level may not necessarily require complete withdrawal of therapy.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Electromagnetic Interference from Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) Inhibiting the Pacing Function of an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) Device
1Department of Medicine, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA2Department of Medicine, Providence VA Medical Center, Providence, RI, USA3Heart and Vascular Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Sebhat Erqou; moc.liamelgoog@uoqretahbesReceived 13 July 2018; Accepted 6 September 2018; Published 3 October 2018Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2018 Sebhat Erqou et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.There is an increasing prevalence of patients with concomitant implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and left ventricular devices (LVADs). The potential for negative interactions between these continually evolving technologies is a valid concern. Previously reported interactions include inappropriate ICD therapy and interference with ICD telemetry function. Understanding the nature of such interactions and developing a comprehensive strategy to approach such situations are important. In this report, we describe a case of electromagnetic interference from LVAD inhibiting the pacing function of an ICD that was corrected by reprograming the device. We would encourage investigators to review patients with ICD and LVAD in their institutions in order to help assess the frequency and nature of these and other interactions.Compared to medical therapy, the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been shown to prolong survival in patients with advanced heart failure who are awaiting or are not candidates for transplant [1]. Since most patients with advanced heart failure already have implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) by the time they get LVAD implants, there is an increasing number of patients with a concomitant ICD and LVAD. With the increasing prevalence of coexistence between ICDs and LVADs, the potential for negative interactions between these devices would presumably increase. To date, a number of cases of adverse electromagnetic interference (EMI) between LVAD and ICD have been reported [2–6]. However, only two case series involving a total of 54 patients with implanted ICD and LVAD have assessed these interactions systematically [7, 8]. The reported interactions include inappropriate ICD therapy and interference with ICD telemetry function involving St. Jude Medical, Boston Scientific, and Sorin devices [2–8]. Understanding the nature of such interactions and developing a comprehensive strategy to approach them are important. In this case report, we describe a patient with an LVAD-ICD interaction that resulted in ventricular oversensing and subsequent inhibition of pacing.A 60-year-old female with history of ovarian cancer, doxorubicin-induced dilated cardiomyopathy, and advanced heart failure had a Medtronic cardiac resynchronization-defibrillator (CRT-D) device placed in May 2010. The patient had implantation of HeartWare LVAD for destination therapy in August 2011 due to progression of heart failure and functional decline. The postsurgical course was complicated by ventricular tachycardia and multiple episodes of pump thrombosis. Interrogation of the CRT-D device in December 2011 (as well as subsequent device checks) revealed that the patient had evidence of complete heart block with no escape rhythm at ventricular backup rate of 40 (Figure 1 EKG). The CRT-D pulse generator was changed to a St. Jude Medical Assura model (3357-40C CRT-D) device in June 2014 once it reached its elective replacement indicator.The patient was admitted to our hospital in November 2015 with concern for LVAD thrombosis. On this admission, the patient was treated with tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) without improvement and was taken to the operating room for LVAD pump exchange on admission day 6. In the immediate postoperative period, it was noted that the patient’s ICD was no longer consistently pacing. This prompted placement of epicardial pacing leads.Device interrogation revealed stable right ventricle (RV), left ventricle (LV), and shock lead impedances. The RV lead pace threshold was increased to 1.75 V at 0.5 ms (previously <1 V at 0.5 ms), while the LV lead pace threshold was stable at 0.75 at 0.5 ms. There was a continuous external noise with a mean amplitude of 1 mV detected by the ventricular sense amplifier of the RV lead. The intracardiac electrograms (IEGMs) showed an increase in a baseline noise signal compared to prior device-based recordings—the amplitude of which correlated with the increase of the LVAD pump rotation speed. The device was reprogrammed to nonsensing mode (DOO) allowing consistent pacer function of the ICD (Figure 2 IEGM). These setting changes meant that the tachytherapy function of the ICD was mandatorily disabled, as the device was set to a nonsensing mode.The EMI oversensing issue was resolved by turning off the “low-frequency attenuation” (LFA) filter, which had resulted in amplification of the high-frequency VAD signal. This allowed the device to function in a sensing/tracking mode (DDD) without inhibition by noise from the LVAD with RV sensitivity threshold of 0.3 mV and permitted functional tachytherapy.The LFA filter is a proprietary option in St. Jude Medical devices that suppresses low-frequency signals with the intent to mitigate T-wave oversensing. As with any “band-pass filter,” in addition to attenuating specific frequencies, they may also enhance or amplify other event frequencies, such as EMI, myopotential, R-waves, and far P-waves. The new VAD cannula position/orientation resulted in injection of the EMI signal more efficiently in the sensing antenna of the existing ICD lead. Additionally, the “sensibility” setting on the St. Jude device decays to baseline maximum sensitivity just prior to the A paced event—thus explaining why EMI was most consistently sensed in this window.The patient underwent a successful defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing 10 days after her VAD exchange surgery. DFT testing showed that the ICD detected VF adequately with minimal dropout at a minimal sensitivity test setting of 1 mV. There was no further problem with the ICD, and the patient was discharged home one week later.To our knowledge, this is the first report where external noise from the LVAD device inhibited the pacer function of an ICD. This was caused by a combination of the new LVAD in-flow cannula position, as well as amplification of EMI by the LFA filter from the ICD. Previously reported interactions include inappropriate ICD therapy and interference with ICD telemetry function, as well as alteration RV sensing and pacing threshold [2–8]. Chhabra et al. [3] and Mozes et al. [6] have independently reported two cases of inappropriate tachytherapy delivery due to adverse EMI between HeartWare LVAD and ICD. Mozes et al. solved the problem by implanting a new pace-sense lead in the RV outflow tract “as far as possible” from the LVAD impeller and capping the pace-sense component of the old RV lead while continuing to use the existing atrial lead and defibrillation coils. A number of other case reports [2, 4, 5] as well as one case series of HeartMate II LVAD [8] have described loss of telemetry function of the ICD device after placement of LVAD, in some cases necessitating ICD replacement.In the present case, we did observe an increase in RV lead pace threshold as was reported by Foo et al. [7]. The present case is unique, however, due to observation of significant adverse EMI causing external noise and leading to oversensing and resultant inhibition of pacing. This necessitated initial placement of epicardial wires in the operating room after the exchange of the LVAD pump. We were able to temporarily restore the pace function by reprogramming the device to nonsensed mode and decreasing the sensitivity of the RV lead to 1 mV, which unfortunately did not allow for the tachytherapy function to be turned on.The HeartWare LVAD is a continuous flow system in which the impeller is suspended within the pump through magnetic and hydrodynamic forces. Electromagnetic forces power the rotational mechanism of the impeller. These electromagnetic forces could lead to adverse EMI with ICD as described above. While this inference may be nonconsequential in some cases, they may also lead to clinically significant problems such as inappropriate ICD shocks and loss of ICD-programmer telemetry, as well as inhibition of RV pacing as observed in our cases. Some of these cases have been corrected by using shielding techniques [4, 5], while others have necessitated ICD replacement. In the present case, we resolved the problem by changing device programming. Generally, it may be prudent to assess for these interactions intraoperatively to circumvent a subsequent ICD performance issue that may not be resolved by simple reprogramming.There is paucity of systematic study into ICD-LVAD interactions. Data from the present and the previous case reports demonstrate that such interactions, albeit not very common, can be consequential. It is important to elucidate detailed mechanisms for ICD-LVAD interactions and describe the various types of interactions in sufficient detail. It will also be useful for investigators to review patients with ICD and LVAD in their institutions to assess the frequency and nature of such interactions.There is accumulating evidence for potential adverse ICD-LVAD interactions. In this report, we described a case of EMI from LVAD inhibiting the pacing function of an ICD that was corrected by reprograming the device. We would encourage investigators to review patients with ICD and LVAD in their institutions to assess the frequency and nature of such interactions.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Advanced Biventricular Heart Failure due to Left Ventricular Noncompaction Cardiomyopathy Leading to the Formation of a Gastric Bezoar: The Implications of Heart Failure on the Gastrointestinal Tract

We report a case of a 43-year-old male with a history of unspecified cardiomyopathy who presented to the hospital with abdominal pain, distention, and nausea for 4 months. He was diagnosed with left ventricular noncompaction and gastroparesis. While symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, or increasing peripheral edema are the first that come to mind when thinking of a CHF exacerbation, we must broaden our scope to include such things as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating which can also indicate worsening cardiac function. This case report highlights the significant yet often forgotten gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms that result from advanced biventricular heart failure, with emphasis on impaired gastric and intestinal motility.Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a chronic disease process affecting multiple organ systems and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the United States (U.S.) alone, its prevalence is close to 6 million, with a yearly incidence of over 550,000 and a death rate of 300,000 per year [1]. This case report will highlight the significant yet often forgotten gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms that result from advanced biventricular heart failure, with emphasis on impaired gastric and intestinal motility.A 43-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension, depression, and an unspecified cardiomyopathy presented to the hospital with complaints of abdominal pain, distention, and nausea for 4 months, worse in recent weeks. The patient had multiple episodes of vomiting with inability to tolerate anything by mouth. His primary care doctor prescribed metoclopramide and famotidine, which provided minimal relief. In parallel to his GI symptoms, the patient also described symptoms of fatigue and worsening shortness of breath on exertion. He denied chest pain, palpitations, diarrhea, constipation, or increased swelling of the legs. The patient was a former cigarette smoker and drank alcohol socially.On physical examination, there was jugular venous distention and trace peripheral edema. Auscultation of the lungs was significant for mildly diminished breath sounds in bilateral lower lobes with bibasilar crepitations. Cardiac auscultation was significant for a 2/6 holosystolic murmur of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Bowel sounds were normal. The abdomen was soft but mildly distended with diffuse tenderness. There was no guarding or rigidity.Initial laboratory findings showed a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 1374 pg/ml consistent with volume overload. The basic metabolic panel was normal. Venous blood gas showed an elevated lactic acid level of 3.2 mmol/l suggesting tissue hypoperfusion. Complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation panel showed a platelet count of 66 K/Ul and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.3 (the patient was not taking anticoagulants prior to admission). These findings indicated some degree of liver dysfunction which was confirmed by abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) that showed an albumin of 3 g/dl, direct bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dl, total bilirubin of 4.0 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase of 98 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase of 121 IU/l, and an alkaline phosphatase of 87 IU/l. Chest radiograph showed cardiac enlargement. The patient was admitted for further workup of abdominal pain and management of acute decompensated heart failure.Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous (IV) contrast was performed showing wall thickening of the cardia of the stomach, a moderate amount of abdominal ascites, and diffuse anasarca and thickening within the proximal sigmoid colon (Figure 1). Abdominal ultrasound (US) showed fatty infiltration of the liver and distention of the intrahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) and hepatic veins. Echocardiogram (ECHO) showed a severely decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic function with ejection fraction (EF) of 21–25%. There was global cardiomyopathy, moderate LV diastolic dysfunction, and severe mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. The right ventricle (RV) was moderately dilated and hypokinetic. The patient’s last known EF was reported to be 40% a year ago.Cardiology evaluated the patient and recommended medical optimization and diuresis with plans for eventual right and left heart catheterization once he was euvolemic. Gastroenterology evaluated the patient for his abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated LFTs. The patient’s liver function was suggestive of cirrhosis. Viral hepatitis panel, iron studies, serum ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, anti-mitochondrial antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and anti-nuclear antibodies were unremarkable, ruling out infectious and autoimmune causes, making the etiology of his cirrhosis and abdominal complaints likely cardiogenic in origin.Upper endoscopy was performed on hospital day 2 to rule out peptic ulcer disease as a cause of his nausea and vomiting, revealing desquamation of the esophageal mucosa in linear streaks and a large gastric bezoar obstructing the view of the underlying mucosa (Figure 2).After the endoscopy, the patient was given one can of Pepsi Cola and otherwise kept nil per os (NPO) for repeat endoscopy the following day with plans of possible bezoar removal. Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed no evidence of the bezoar (Figure 3).Despite resolution of the bezoar, the patient continued to have complaints of intermittent nausea. Right and left heart catheterization was performed on hospital day 8, showing normal coronaries, reduced cardiac output, and mild pulmonary hypertension. It was suspected that the reason pulmonary pressures were noted to be lower than expected was because the patient had received aggressive dieresis in the days leading up to the catheterization and was relatively euvolemic.His medications were optimized and he was fitted for a LifeVest prior to discharge from the hospital. After discharge, he underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) which revealed a diagnosis of left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) (Figure 4). Cardiac output of the LV in cardiac MRI was measured to be 4.08 l/min with and EF of 28%. The RV was moderately dilated and noted to have an EF of 27%.He also underwent a nuclear medicine gastric emptying study, which showed 24% gastric emptying at 90 minutes with the majority of the radioactive meal remaining in the proximal stomach. This study confirmed gastroparesis in our patient, presumably secondary to worsening cardiac function in the presence of biventricular failure due to noncompaction cardiomyopathy.As the prevalence of heart failure increases, so does the number of organ systems we see being affected by the disease. While symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, or increasing peripheral edema are the first that come to mind when thinking of a CHF exacerbation, we must broaden our scope to include such things as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating which can also indicate worsening cardiac function. Here, we look into the pathophysiology of the failing heart and its effect on the structure and function of the gastrointestinal system.In the stomach, there can be notable thickening of the mucosa and areas of vascular ectasias [2]. The small intestine and the colon may display sonographic evidence of bowel wall edema with increased intestinal wall thickness. Increased distance between the basal membrane of the intestinal cells and the capillary blood flow leads to impaired nutrition of the enterocytes resulting in decreased absorptive function of the bowel wall [2]. The sigmoid colon is of particular importance as increased thickness positively correlates with an increase in blood concentrations of C-reactive protein and leukocytes [2].Naturally, changes in the structure of the GI tract affect its function. The intestine is one of the most perfused organs at rest, receiving approximately 25% of the cardiac output [2]. At maximal exercise intensity, gut perfusion drops to 4% of the cardiac output [3]. The sympathetic nervous system innervates the splanchnic circulation, thus at a time of increased sympathetic stimulation, there is constriction of the blood vessels leading to decreased intestinal perfusion [2]. Thus, even minimal changes in cardiac output (i.e., ejection fraction) can lead to significant intestinal ischemia [2]. Ischemia results in a decrease in intestinal motility and absorption and an increase in bowel wall permeability [3]. Bowel wall edema and decreased perfusion cause the gut wall to lose its integrity, becoming more permeable to bacteria, increasing rates of bacterial colonization. Food and nutrients are absorbed into enterocytes and later the capillaries via transcellular and paracellular transport. Sugar absorption studies show an increased absorption of transfer proteins in the small and large bowel, suggesting disruption of the intestinal membrane [2].There is a phenomenon that occurs in end-stage CHF patients in which there is impaired absorption of fats and proteins resulting in severe unintentional weight loss. Cardiac cachexia is found in 16–42% of heart failure patients [2]. This finding is most pronounced in patients with functional class III and IV heart failure. These patients were measured to have an increased amount of protein and fat in their feces in comparison to patients without CHF [2]. Cardiac muscle wasting causes further decline of cardiac function. Cardiac cachexia is a predictive factor of increased mortality in patients with heart failure [2].In heart failure, there is overactivity of the sympathetic system and a blunted parasympathetic response [4]. Although the sympathetic activity can be regulated pharmacologically with beta blockers and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors, this is not the case for the parasympathetic system [4]. The parasympathetic vagus nerve innervates multiple organs including the heart and the GI tract [4]. Trials and studies have analyzed the use of vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) in advanced heart failure. Results show improvements in NYHA class, quality of life and end-systolic volumes measured via ECHO [4]. VNS has also been studied in patients with drug refractory gastroparesis, a chronic impairment in gastric motility and delayed emptying. Noninvasive cervical vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) similar to implanted gastric electric stimulation (GES) shows reduction in symptoms of nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and abdominal bloating [5].Cardiogenic cirrhosis, also known as congestive hepatopathy, occurs as a result of right-sided heart failure or in the case of our patient, biventricular heart failure [6]. The backup of blood from the right ventricle into the liver results in hepatic congestion and subsequent damage. Interestingly, the changes on the GI tract that occur with advanced heart failure are very similar to the ones that occur as a result of liver cirrhosis. These include delayed gastric emptying, slowed gut motility, increased bowel permeability, and bacterial translocation [6].CMR revealed that our patient had LVNC, a structural abnormality in which the left ventricle has a thinner than normal compacted layer and trabeculae [7]. This defect occurs during embryonic development with the premature cessation of endomyocardial compaction within the left ventricle, resulting in the formation of trabeculations and deep intratrabecular recesses [8]. This can lead to cardiomyopathy; however, it is a rare incidental finding in healthy individuals with preserved LV function, which accounts for approximately 35% of LVNC cases [8]. In adults, the prevalence of LVNC is about 0.05% [8]. 3-4% of heart failure patients sent for ECHO are found to have LVNC [8]. LVNC is more commonly found in African Americans and in males, with average age of diagnosis being 40–50 years old [8]. Overall, about 8 forms of LVNC exist with varying heterogeneity [8]. The diagnosis is made with ECHO or CMR by measuring the ratio of noncompacted to compacted layers of the LV muscle wall, with a ratio of ≥2 : 1 meeting the criteria for LVNC [8]. Although the etiology of LVNC is uncertain, it is thought to be genetic in origin [8]. Research has shown links between abnormalities in certain genes, metabolic, mitochondrial, and chromosomal diseases, with the occurrence of LVNC [7]. The genetic defects most commonly associated with LVNC are of the sarcomere genes which are also involved with both dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies [8].Mitochondrial disorders also known as mitochondriopathies (MCPs) can be either syndromic or nonsyndromic and can present at any age, affect any organ, and have broad symptomatology [9]. The heart is one of the most commonly affected organs in MCPs [9]. Cardiac manifestations can include cardiomyopathies, LVNC, and arrhythmias [9]. Gastrointestinal manifestations of MCPs include dysphagia, gastroparesis, vomiting, malabsorption, diarrhea, pseudoobstruction, pancreatitis, and hepatopathy [10]. Over 50% of MCPs show some GI involvement although this is often underdiagnosed [10]. Episodic vomiting is a common manifestation and often first presenting symptom of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode syndrome (MELAS) [10]. Gastroparesis is a less frequent manifestation of nonsyndromic MCPs and occurs due to a metabolic defect in the smooth muscle cells or from decreased parasympathetic innervation [10]. Hepatopathy in MCPs although more commonly seen in children may result in elevated liver enzymes and hepatic steatosis [10]. Involvement of the liver can be seen in up to 20% of patients with mitochondrial disorders [10].Advanced stage heart failure is not a typical or well-studied cause of gastroparesis. Although gastric emptying studies demonstrated that our patient did indeed have gastroparesis, it is possible that he had components of both bowel wall edema and vagal nerve dysfunction from his enlarged heart, leading to delayed gastric emptying, abdominal discomfort, and formation of a gastric bezoar. The ultimate culprit was his failing heart. Better control of the patient’s heart failure with recovery of function and improvement in ejection fraction may give some symptom relief. This can only be monitored by close patient follow-up. It will also be interesting to conduct more research in the future to investigate mitochondriopathies to understand the link between LVNC and gastroparesis.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Inverted Yoga and Near Syncope: An Unusual Diagnosis of Right Ventricular Myxoma
Providence Hospital, Southfield, MI, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Robby Singh; moc.liamg@7969ybborReceived 7 February 2018; Accepted 10 September 2018; Published 1 October 2018Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2018 Wadie David et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Primary cardiac tumors are extremely rare and are difficult to diagnose. Although usually benign in nature, myxomas require surgical resection due to their increased risk of embolic and cardiac complications, with the timing of resection dependent on the presentation and size of the tumor. However, if diagnosed early, patients with primary benign cardiac tumors have excellent prognosis following surgery. Therefore, a high index of suspicion and a wide differential diagnosis are very important in detecting rare conditions that can affect otherwise healthy individuals. We present an uncommon case of a right ventricular myxoma that was discovered when the patient was performing inverted yoga and experienced a near syncopal episode. Patient subsequently underwent an echocardiographic evaluation and was found to have a right ventricular myxoma that was excised. Although recurrence is rare, it is important for physicians to remain vigilant and continue careful and consistent follow-up for patients with a history of a cardiac myxoma.Primary cardiac tumors are very rare with an incidence rate of between 0.0017 and. 19% reported on autopsies of unselected patients and most are benign [1]. The vast majority, roughly 70–80%, are found in the left atrium and 10–20% in the right atrium [2]. Right ventricular myxomas are rarer still, with an incidence of only 2–4% [3]. Patients are typically asymptomatic and the malignancies are discovered either incidentally or when embolization or myocardial infiltration has occurred, which may lead to a rapid demise. We herein describe an extremely rare case of a right ventricular myxoma with an unusual clinical presentation.A 51-year-old previously healthy and physically active woman presented as an outpatient with complaints of lightheadedness and dizziness. In addition to her activities of daily living, the patient plays competitive tennis without any limitations or symptoms. Recently, while doing aerial yoga, she felt lightheaded and experienced a presyncopal episode, specifically while hanging upside down and performing hand stands. On physical exam, vital signs were normal and the exam was unremarkable except for the cardiac exam. The precordium was quiet with no displacement of the point of maximal impulse. There was a grade III/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border and the electrocardiogram revealed a left bundle branch block. Subsequently, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and revealed a mass in the right ventricle attached to the posterior wall and prolapsing into the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in systole (Figure 1).Next, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to better characterize the mass, which measured 2.6 cm × 4.1 cm and was mobile and prolapsed into the RVOT during systole resulting in a mild dynamic obstruction (Figure 2(a)). Color Doppler revealed turbulent flow in the RVOT and pressure gradient measurements revealed a gradient of 26 mmHg across the RVOT while the patient was heavily sedated and in a supine position (Figure 2(b)). We suspect that with aerial yoga, and the resulting upside-down suspension, the gradient would be higher. Therefore, the obstruction would be enhanced, resulting in decreased cardiac output and cerebral hypoperfusion, which could explain the presenting symptoms of lightheadedness and dizziness. The patient was referred to cardiothoracic surgery for further evaluation and underwent a cardiac catheterization prior to thoracotomy which also showed evidence of a RV mass (Figure 3). A thoracotomy with excision of the mass was performed (Figure 4), and pathological examination revealed the mass as a myxoma (Figure 5). The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home. She has been continued to follow up regularly two years postresection of the myxoma and continues to do well. She continues to experience no limitations in performing her activities of daily living nor while playing competitive tennis or performing aerial yoga. Repeat echocardiogram two years postresection did not reveal any evidence of recurrence of the myxoma (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)).The majority of myxomas are found in the left atrium and symptoms are typically seen when tumor growth interferes with normal cardiac function [4]. Up to 12–15% of cardiac myxomas are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally or during postmortem examination. The majority present with a combination of symptoms such as obstruction of blood flow to the neighboring chamber, thromboembolic events, hemodynamic changes, conduction disease, and otherwise nonspecific symptoms. Obstruction of blood flow can lead to impaired atrial filling, heart failure, chronic passive congestion of the lungs, and dyspnea. Obstruction can also lead to hemodynamic changes caused by systemic emboli, particularly in right-sided lesions which can propagate to the pulmonary arteries and result in obstruction or left-sided lesions causing cerebral emboli. Additionally, depending on the location of the tumor, growth can disrupt nodal or septal conduction tissue leading to heart arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death [4].Mitral valve stenosis and regurgitation may be seen in patients with mobile left atrial tumors. On physical exam, one can also listen for a “tumor plop,” an acoustic diastolic sound that is caused by the presence of a mobile myxoma inside the atrial chamber. This is typically seen in 15% of patients and occurs when the tumor comes to rest over the mitral annulus. These tumors interfere with valve coaptation and can often be recognized by the astute clinician which may lead to further workup.One unique characteristic of myxomas is its ability to mimic systemic autoimmune diseases. Myxomas have the capacity to secrete interleukin 6 and 8 (IL-6 and IL-8), especially IL-6, which is a pleiotropic cytokine that increases B cell differentiation and leads to increased synthesis of polyclonal immunoglobulins [4]. In addition, it is a strong hepatocyte-stimulating factor, which induces the release of acute-phase proteins [4]. IL-6 is also implicated in increased tumor growth and tumor recurrence. Theses cytokines also lead to nonspecific symptoms which are seen in about 80–85% of cases such as fatigue, lethargy, weakness, erythema, weight loss, and decreased appetite [4].In addition, depending on the size of the tumor, many patients can present with chromic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia [4]. These conditions are caused by abnormal blood flow leading to damaged RBCs as they pass over the tumor surface [4]. Diagnosis of these tumors is typically made by echocardiography which is highly sensitive and can differentiate cardiac tumors from other cardiac masses such as vegetation and thrombi [4].While many patients present with multiple symptoms, these tumors may also be asymptomatic, making them especially difficult to diagnose. If gone undiagnosed and untreated, these can result in severe cardiac complications due to obstruction of blood flow and potential disruption of nodal conduction tissue. In our case, a right ventricular myxoma, among the rarest forms of cardiac malignancy, manifested with RVOT obstruction leading to syncope, though the outcome could have been more disastrous had the obstruction been more prolonged. For this reason, it is essential that the diagnosis is made early, and although most cases require surgical resection, recovery is often rapid. While recurrence is rare, it is important to have careful and consistent follow-up with patients who have a history of a cardiac myxoma.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Decitabine Induced Delayed Cardiomyopathy in Hematologic Malignancy
1Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Arizona 85259, USA2Department of Cardio-Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Arizona 85259, USA3Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Arizona 85259, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Pradyumna Agasthi; moc.liamtoh@ihtsaga_anmuydarpReceived 24 June 2018; Accepted 16 August 2018; Published 30 September 2018Academic Editor: Hiroaki KitaokaCopyright © 2018 Pradyumna Agasthi et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Decitabine is a pyrimidine analogue of nucleoside cytidine, used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and acute myelogenous leukemia. We present a case of cardiomyopathy associated with decitabine used for secondary acute myelogenous leukemia. The patient presented with new heart failure symptoms and an ejection fraction decline.Decitabine is a pyrimidine analogue of the nucleoside cytidine [1]. It inhibits DNA methylation and plays a role in reversing epigenetic silencing in malignant cells. Decitabine is currently indicated in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) [2–4]. To our knowledge, one case of myocarditis [5] and one case of reversible nonischemic cardiomyopathy [6] from decitabine have been reported, this being the 3rd case.A 71-year-old female with a history significant for hypertension, hepatitis B, and hypothyroidism, underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed a hypercellular bone marrow with >90% cellularity and 81% myeloblasts expressing CD 34 and CD 117 markers, confirming a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Molecular testing showed no evidence for FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication, absence of nucleophosmin1 and KIT exon 8, and 17 mutations, suggesting a lower risk of relapse after chemotherapy. Based on cytogenetic studies, secondary AML was diagnosed. Given her advanced age, decitabine therapy was commenced. A baseline 2-D transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal function with an ejection fraction (EF) of 55–60%. After completing 10 cycles of decitabine, she was noted to have a tachycardia and dyspnea by self-report. She was therefore referred to cardiology with these symptoms in preparation for allogeneic stem cell transplant.The heart rate was 110/min, and a 2/6 ejection systolic murmur and a loud P2 with an S3 and S4 gallop were heard. Lungs were clear. No jugular venous distension or pedal edema was noted.Laboratory data is significant for a serum creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate of 80 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide level of 517 pg/ml. Her complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 12.6 × 109/l with greater than 50% blasts, low hemoglobin at 7.8 g/dl, hematocrit value of 25%, large platelet count of 212 × 109/l, and lactate dehydrogenase level of 588 U/l. Serum troponin or creatinine phosphokinase levels were not performed due to a lack of discernibility in patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. Echocardiogram showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 28%), mildly abnormal end systolic dimension (Figure 1), and a mild reduction in right ventricular systolic function. Global averaged left ventricular longitudinal peak systolic strain was abnormal at −12% (normal more negative than −18%) (Figure 2). Nuclear stress test showed no evidence of coronary disease. Patient was euthyroid at the time of diagnosis.The patient was diagnosed with New York Heart Association class II and American Heart Association stage B heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In the absence of any viral illness, toxins, or coronary disease, or concomitant cardiotoxic medication use and known recent normal ejection fraction, the etiology was attributed to decitabine use. The patient was subsequently started on metoprolol succinate 50 mg twice a day and furosemide 20 mg daily. Follow-up echocardiogram 4 weeks later showed no change in the ejection fraction of 28%, but there was mild improvement in the global left ventricular longitudinal peak systolic strain at −15% (improved from −12%).Decitabine is an azanucleoside (AZN), a pyrimidine analogue of cytidine. Cancer cells often exhibit severely altered chromatin structure and methylation patterns leading to promoter hypermethylation and silencing of key tumor suppressor genes. The inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and other critical genes leads to unopposed proliferation of cancer cells [7–9].Low dose AZNs have shown optimal inhibition of DNA methylation leading to subsequent cellular differentiation [10]. Decitabine inhibits the action of DNA methyltransferase and restores the normal growth and differentiation of cells [11]. Decitabine was approved in 2006 for high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes of all French-American-British subtypes, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, and sickle cell anemia [3, 6, 12]. The common cardiovascular adverse effects ascribed to decitabine include peripheral edema (25%), cardiac murmurs (16%), chest discomfort (7%), and hypotension (6%) [4, 6].Reports of decitabine-related cardiotoxicity in the literature are scant with a case of myocarditis in a 50-year-old female treated with azacitidine and decitabine for MDS [5]. A reversible nonischemic cardiomyopathy from decitabine in a 75-year-old patient treated with decitabine for AML, presented with heart failure and an EF of 35%. Left heart catheterization showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. With guideline-based heart failure therapy, EF normalised [6].We present a 71-year-old female treated with AML for 10 cycles presenting with symptoms of EF decline. Table 1 [6] shows the comparison of the previously reported reversible cardiomyopathy.Approval for the use of decitabine in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes are based on two clinical trials [3, 13]. The number of patients in the clinical trials were 170 and 66, respectively. Mean ages of the patients were 68 yrs and 70 yrs. None of the patients participating in the clinical trials developed cardiomyopathy or heart failure. However, no routine echocardiograms or biomarkers were used during the study. The literature suggests that the mechanism for cardiomyopathy is likely myocarditis based on patent coronaries on coronary angiogram and biomarker elevation [6]. The current package insert mentions cardiomyopathy as a potential side effect without the suggestion that it may be attributable to myocarditis [14]. A recent retrospective study of 111 patients with AML treated with decitabine showed a higher incidence of cardiotoxic side effects in patients with renal dysfunction. New onset heart failure was noted only in patients with renal dysfunction [15]. Our patient developed cardiac dysfunction despite normal kidney function. Contrary to prior reports, our patient had a delayed onset of cardiac dysfunction, which is unique. Clearly, the etiology for cardiac dysfunction with decitabine therapy may be bimodal (early onset versus delayed) and may be due either to hypersensitivity to hypomethylating agents causing myocarditis or to cardiac cell injury. This has yet to be elucidated. We hypothesize that the reason for the lack of cardiac function recovery in our patient might be directly related to the extent or duration of cardiomyocyte injury endured over the prolonged course of decitabine therapy.The prevalence of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is increasing because of longer cancer survivorship and multiple new chemotherapeutic regimens where cardiac side effects are understudied. Early detection and prompt treatment is the best strategy. Many of the chemotherapeutic agents have not been studied a priori for cardiotoxicity and are symptom driven. Cardiac dysfunction symptoms may mimic the side effects attributable to the chemotherapy and no standard screening guidelines exist, especially for newer drugs.Lessons learned from the monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, which was shown to have a much higher incidence of cardiotoxicity post marketing, need to be applied to newer agents. Well-designed clinical trials involving chemotherapeutic agents or registries for chemotherapeutic agents should be studied for the potential for cardiotoxicity.We present a third case of cardiomyopathy with decitabine used for secondary AML. Since older populations are more prone to chemotherapy-associated cardiomyopathy, screening these vulnerable groups may be helpful for early diagnosis and early treatment.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.
Catastrophic Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis Caused by Rare Black Fungi
Florida Hospital, Orlando, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Khurram Butt; gro.psohlf@dm.ttub.marruhkReceived 8 April 2018; Revised 2 August 2018; Accepted 5 September 2018; Published 30 September 2018Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2018 Khurram Butt et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Fungal infection of prosthetic heart valves is rare and can lead to severe complications including death. Dematiaceous mold, also known as “black fungi,” are an extremely rare cause of endocarditis that usually affect immunocompromised hosts. The infection is usually chronic and can lead to heart failure and embolic complications. These fungi have limited antifungal treatment modalities. We present a rare case of prosthetic aortic valve, root, and graft infection in an immunocompetent host that revealed itself through renal, mesenteric, and cerebral embolic phenomenon. The patient underwent removal and replacement of the aortic graft followed by small bowel resection for mesenteric infarction. Patient had a successful postoperative course and underwent a long-term antifungal treatment with amphotericin B and voriconazole.Fungal infection of native and prosthetic cardiac valves in an immunocompetent patient is a rare occurrence and is a rather dreaded disease. Its estimated incidence can be as high as 2.9% [1] and mortality rate ranges from 23 to 46% [2–5]. The most common fungal agents affecting native heart valves are Candida, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma with Candida species being the most common amongst them [6, 7]. We hereby present a rare case of fungal prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and ascending aortic root graft infection in an immunocompetent host caused by dematiaceous mold.A 68-year-old male with past medical history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), aortic valve replacement along with replacement of the root of the ascending aorta 10 months prior to presentation and recent hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), came to the hospital with complains of acute onset of severe abdominal pain and melena for 1 day. He also attested to chronic abdominal pain and a 30-pound weight loss over the last 8 months prior to these acute symptoms. His physical exam on presentation was positive for severe bilateral lower abdominal tenderness. Apart from a hemoglobin of 10 mg/dl and a positive stool occult blood test, the rest of his basic lab work up was unremarkable (white blood cell/platelet count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and PT/INR included). Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing were negative. The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm and left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 1). An emergent computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed features suggestive of an embolic infarct in the left kidney (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)) and within the mid-one-third of the superior mesenteric artery causing luminal narrowing and also suspected to be extending to the takeoff of small bowel branches. Segmental mural thickening of at least one small bowel loop was noted which strongly favored acute bowel ischemia as a cause of his abdominal pain (Figure 2(c)). Incidental findings on CT of the abdomen were also strongly suspicious for large eccentric thrombus in the ascending aortic graft and the aortic root which were further investigated and confirmed with a CT scan of the chest (Figure 3). Cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery were consulted. A CT scan of the head was performed to assess the recent CVA and showed a subacute hemorrhage along the left-sided temporal parenchyma (Figure 2(d)). CT head imaging was obtained from the facility where the patient presented 3 months prior for cerebral hemorrhage and in comparison, to the most recent CT scan of the head, the hemorrhage appeared stable. The hemorrhage was suspected to be secondary to thromboembolism. After a review of the risks and benefits of anticoagulation to prevent extension of this suspected thrombus, heparin was initiated. An echocardiogram revealed dilatation of the ascending aorta and mild paravalvular leak around the bioprosthetic aortic valve. Gastroenterology was consulted and an emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which was negative for any causes of upper gastrointestinal bleed. A hypercoagulable workup was performed which did not reveal any apparent cause of a prothrombotic state. Anticoagulation was held and subsequently, the patient underwent a redo sternotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass with extensive lysis of adhesions, removal of the thrombosed aortic valve and graft, ascending and proximal aortic arch replacement utilizing a 30 mm Dacron graft, and aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm Edwards Magna Ease bovine pericardial valve. The patient also underwent an explorative laparotomy as a part of a staged procedure to address the ischemic bowel caused by the presumed septic emboli. Intraoperatively, the patient was found to have a portion of small bowel that had become necrotic. The necrotic bowel was excised and an end to end anastomosis was performed.The aortic graft and thrombus were sent for culture and pathology. Histopathological examination of the aortic graft and cusps of the aortic valve revealed chronic inflammation and was also notable for abundant acute angle branching septate fungal hyphae (Figure 4). The patient was immediately started on amphotericin B and voriconazole pending finalization of cultures and sensitivities. On postoperative day four, three culture reports from the graft came back positive for dematiaceous mold, suggestive of Bipolaris species. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 0.25 ug/dl for voriconazole and 0.03 ug/ml for amphotericin B. A decision was made to continue the same antifungal regimen on the basis of sensitivities and further speciation was not performed. Patient had a good postoperative course and was later discharged on amphotericin B and voriconazole for at least 1 month with continued follow-up with an infectious disease specialist.Dematiaceous mold, also known as “black fungi” owing to the presence of melanin like pigments, are a heterogeneous group of filamentous molds. These saprophytic and plant pathogenic fungi are now increasingly being recognized as causes of human infection, particularly in immunocompromised persons, such as diabetics, transplant recipients, and patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [8]. Dematiaceous molds are often found in soil and thus have a worldwide distribution. These molds cause a heterogeneous group of infections referred to as phaeohyphomycosis which include local infections, pneumonia, brain abscesses, and disseminated infections. Phaeohyphomycosis is characterized by the presence of black-pigmented hyphae or pseudohyphae.Bipolaris genus belongs to the group of dematiaceous molds and has more than 100 species. These organisms are mostly pathogens of plants; however, a few saprobic species are potentially able to infect humans and animals. Morphologically, Bipolaris species are differentiated by their rapidly growing dark colonies, large conidia with transverse distosepta (Figure 5), and bipolar method of germination. Bipolaris species are an extremely rare cause of endocarditis and aortic root infection, especially in an immunocompetent host. These infections evolve chronically and predispose to thromboembolic phenomenon which can be the primary manifestation of infection as evidenced by our case.Vallabhaneni et al. [9] identified 21 cases of surgical site infection caused by Bipolaris species in over ten hospitals located in Texas, Arkansas, and Florida out of which 6 cases involved valve replacement. Pauzner et al. [10] reported a case of homograft aortic valve infected with Bipolaris spicifera now termed as “Curuvularia spicifera” which was treated with surgical valve replacement and antifungal medications. The patient had a good long-term outcome. Ogden et al. [11] also reported fungal endarteritis of the ascending aorta by Bipolaris species following replacement of the aortic valve with a porcine valve which ultimately resulted in the patient’s death. Our case represents a rare success story with a successful treatment outcome in endocarditis/endarteritis caused by dematiaceous mold in an immunocompetent patient managed aggressively with surgical and antifungal treatments.The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) guidelines recommend using voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, or in some cases amphotericin B to target infections caused by dematiaceous molds [12]. However, the current antifungal treatment modalities for patients infected with dematiaceous mold are limited, and the outcome of antifungal treatment appears dismal. In one survey, it was shown that only 23% of the patients treated with amphotericin B survived [13]. Itraconazole has been shown to be active against many species of the dematiaceous molds and there are case reports of successful treatment of some patients with systemic forms of phaeohyphomycosis, such as arthritis and osteomyelitis, including those refractory to other agents [14]. Treatment with newer agents, such as voriconazole, or treatment with combinations of antifungal agents may prove to be encouraging in the management of these infections [15]. Due to limited data on sensitivities and treatment response, usually, a two or more drug combination is employed and treatment continued under supervision of an infectious disease specialist after discharge from the hospital.Written informed consent was obtained.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Associated with Polycythemia Vera

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by transient apical ballooning with preserved basal ventricular function triggered by physical or emotional stressors. We present a case of a 75-year-old man referred to our facility for the management of acute myocardial infarction later diagnosed as takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We believe platelet-mediated adrenaline release from massive thrombocytosis might have been the precipitating factor for the pathogenesis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) was first reported by Sato et al. in 1990 [1]. TTC, named after a semblance of the left ventricle in systole with an octopus trap, is characterized by transient, reversible, apical ballooning with preservation of basal ventricular function, commonly seen in postmenopausal women after emotional or physical stressors [1, 2]. We present a case of TTC which developed during a hospital stay for pneumonia suspected secondary to rapidly increasing platelet count in an elderly gentleman with a history of polycythemia vera (PV).The patient is a 75-year-old man referred to our facility for the further management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He had presented 3 days earlier to an outside hospital with shortness of breath and productive cough of one-day duration. The evaluation was positive for right-sided pneumonia and was started on intravenous ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin. He was gradually improving but on day 3 of admission developed worsening shortness of breath with tachypnea and oxygen desaturation. He denied any precordial pain. His electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST-segment elevation in anterolateral precordial leads with QT/QTc interval prolongation (Figure 1). Troponin T then was 0.01 ng/mL (reference range: <0.01 ng/mL). Chest X-ray (CXR) showed diffuse pulmonary edema. He was started on intravenous (IV) furosemide and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. He was then transferred to our facility for expectant cardiac catheterization.On presentation, the patient was intubated, and history was obtained from the patient’s family. According to them, the patient was functionally active at baseline prior to presentation. He ambulated with a cane but was able to go up a flight of stairs without anginal symptoms. His past medical history was significant for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, polycythemia vera, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, aortic stenosis, anemia, chronic kidney disease stage IV, and stroke. He had undergone cardiac catheterization 2 years ago which had shown 40–50% stenosis of ostial left anterior descending (LAD) artery and 50% stenosis of the first diagonal branch. The patient was diagnosed with JAK2 V617F mutation-positive polycythemia vera 22 years ago and was maintained on hydroxyurea and darbepoetin alfa. Hydroxyurea was discontinued 2 weeks prior to presentation for anemia (hemoglobin 7 g/dL; reference range: 14–17 g/dL) requiring a blood transfusion and was started on ruxolitinib. Hydroxyurea was restarted 2 days prior at the referring hospital for worsening thrombocytosis.On examination, the patient was afebrile with a pulse of 80 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 98/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28/min, and 99% saturation on FiO2 of 70% intubated on assist control mode of ventilation. Chest examination revealed diffuse crackles and aortic stenosis murmur. He did not have pedal edema. His platelet count was 3,321,000/μL (reference range: 140,000–400,000/μL) and was described as giant platelets on peripheral smear. During the stay, his platelet count peaked at 4,145,000/μL. His white cell count was 13,100/μL (reference range: 4000–11,000/μL), and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Creatinine was elevated at 3.1 mg/dL (reference range: 0.7–1.4 mg/dL; baseline: 2.3–2.5 mg/dL) His probrain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 12,885 pg/mL (reference range: <450 pg/mL). Troponin T was 0.99 ng/mL. As EKG in the outside hospital showed ST elevation, he received 2 units packed red cells to reach goal hemoglobin between 9–10 g/dl. Repeat hemoglobin was 9.3 g/dL. He was continued on dual antiplatelet therapy and metoprolol tartrate 50 mg twice daily. He was started on heparin infusion. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 35% and moderately decreased left ventricular systolic function with dyskinetic to akinetic distal half of both ventricles consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Figure 2). Cardiac catheterization revealed nonobstructive coronary artery disease (Figure 3). Heparin infusion was discontinued. Post catheterization, his hospital stay was uneventful. He was successfully extubated and discharged a week later (hydroxyurea 1000 mg and ruxolitinib 5 mg both twice daily).Several theories have been postulated to explain the pathogenesis of TTC. The leading mechanism is direct myocardial damage from increased catecholamine release [1]. Acute stressors activate central and peripheral adrenergic sympathetic nervous system stimulating massive amounts of catecholamine secretion [1, 3]. This leads to increased cardiac workload with coronary microvascular spasm, consequent demand ischemia, and postischemic stunning [3]. This effect is profound in the apical myocardium where negatively inotropic β-adrenergic receptors are abundant. This differential distribution leads to the characteristic takotsubo-like appearance on echocardiography. In postmenopausal women, the loss of the effect of estrogen exaggerates the responses of central neurons and cardiac cells and possibly attenuates the production of cardioprotective substances. Abnormalities in glucose or fatty acid metabolism and excessive coronary vasoconstriction from defect in endothelial relaxation are other proposed mechanisms for the development of TTC [1].TTC has previously been reported in association with esophageal carcinoma [4]. It has not been described in association with PV. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative disorder with an increased risk of both arterial and venous thromboembolism including acute myocardial infarction through increased risk for clot formation [5]. In most patients with PV, elevated hemoglobin > 18.5 g/dL is associated with thrombocytosis (platelet count > 450,000/μL in 53%) [6]. Contrastingly, our patient was anemic and had nonobstructive coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. His platelet counts were rapidly increasing prior to presentation possibly due to discontinuation of hydroxyurea. Platelets are one of the earliest responders at the site of injury. Their antimicrobial properties come from releasing cytokines and internalizing microorganisms [7]. They also have stores of adrenaline which are released at the same time [8]. We suspect an exaggerated adrenaline release from an abnormally elevated number of platelets might have acted as a stressor and triggered TTC.TTC is estimated to account for 1% to 2% of cases among patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome [1]. Deshmukh et al. reported that it was exceedingly common in women than in men, more so in women > 55 years of age [9]. There is usually an identifiable physical (36.0%) trigger like surgery, trauma, infection, and exacerbation of lung disease or emotional trigger (27.7%) [1, 10]. Common presenting complaints include chest pain, shortness of breath, and syncope. On rare occasions, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias may occur [1]. Cardiogenic shock is commonly seen in the setting of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction from basal hypercontractility [11]. Our patient had demonstrated LVOT obstruction but was not in cardiogenic shock.Mayo Clinic criteria proposed for the diagnosis of TTC requires fulfillment of 4 conditions [12]:
1.Transient hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis of the left ventricular mid segments with or without apical involvement; the regional wall motion abnormalities extending beyond a single epicardial vascular distribution; a stressful trigger often but not always present2.The absence of obstructive coronary disease or angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture3.New electrocardiographic abnormalities (either ST-segment elevation and/or T-wave inversion) or modest elevation in cardiac troponin4.The absence of pheochromocytoma and myocarditisWe did not work up our patient for pheochromocytoma or myocarditis during his hospital stay. However, he had an old imaging of his abdomen which was negative for any adrenal mass. Clinical history did not co-relate with the presentation of pheochromocytoma or myocarditis. Wall motion abnormality on echocardiography with characteristic apical ballooning and basal hypercontractility makes TTC more likely. Our patient had ST-segment elevation and QT/QTc interval prolongation on EKG which is characteristic for TTC [1, 10]. Regarding cardiac biomarkers, troponin is only modestly elevated in TTC in comparison to STEMI [1] whereas brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are usually higher in TTC than in STEMI [3, 10]. Although levels of both cardiac biomarkers may have been confounded by his stage IV chronic kidney disease, our patient had manifold elevation in pro-BNP than troponin T. Coronary angiography typically shows normal coronary arteries or nonobstructive coronary artery disease with wall motion abnormalities that extend beyond the distribution of a single coronary artery [1, 3, 10]. Thus, coronary atherosclerosis does not exclude a diagnosis of TTC [10].TTC is initially managed as acute myocardial infarction with oxygen, aspirin, intravenous heparin, and beta blockers [1, 11]. Cardiac catheterization should not be delayed with suspicion for TTC [10]. Once confirmed, aspirin can be discontinued in the absence of coronary artery disease [1, 11]. Intravenous heparin should be continued in the absence of contraindications to prevent left ventricular apical thrombus formation. This should be bridged to warfarin which should be continued until documented resolution of regional wall motion abnormalities. In the presence of an LVOT obstruction, nitroglycerin or inotropes should be avoided as it can worsen obstruction [11]. TTC usually resolves in a few days to weeks [3, 11]. The prognosis is favorable with in-hospital mortality ranging from 0 to 8% [11].This is the first case to relate excess adrenaline release from platelets as a physical stressor in a patient with PV leading to TTC. We hope this case will bring forward other similar observations and help in better understanding the underlying pathogenetic mechanism.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

Unfortunately, even with treatment from emergency medical service (EMS) staff and hospitalization, only 12% survive past discharge for multiple reasons. Classically, Brugada syndrome (BrS) initially presents as a new syncopal episode in young males without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). However, in this case report, a patient who emergently presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) challenges the stereotypical presentation. Despite successful stent placement for relatively minor obstructive CAD, new ST-segment elevations appeared on electrocardiogram (ECG) and persistent ventricular fibrillation arrests may signify an additional underlying pathology of BrS.A 54-year-old man with no prior past medical history presented to the emergency department after suffering from an OHCA. As the driver of a single-vehicle accident, he lost control after suddenly slumping over the wheel. Fortunately, a police officer nearby initiated CPR with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) achieved shortly afterwards. When EMS arrived, he was unresponsive, hypertensive (170/90 mmHg), and tachycardic (140 beats per minute, sinus rhythm). Emergent intubation in the field was required due to failure of airway protection. Afterwards, an air ambulance transported the patient to our hospital for immediate cardiac catherization.Less than 90 minutes elapsed from time of initial collapse to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Coronary angiography revealed 70% stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) without obstruction elsewhere. A drug-eluting stent (DES) was successfully placed with resultant 0% stenosis in the RCA and TIMI 3 flow. Additionally, telemetry monitoring showed complete resolution of ST-segment changes to normal sinus rhythm. Dual-antiplatelet therapy load of aspirin 325 mg and ticagrelor 180 mg were also given prior to moving the patient to PACU, where he recovered without complications. Since the patient suffered an OHCA with uncertain time to ROSC, therapeutic mild hypothermia (TMH) protocol was initiated upon his arrival to the CCU.Several hours after TMH protocol initiation, a code blue was called due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. Ten minutes elapsed until ROSC to sinus tachycardia (170 beats per minute); he received four rounds of CPR, three defibrillator-delivered electrical shocks (300 J), and two epinephrine injections. Stat labs revealed no electrolyte derangements. Several minutes later, the rhythm degenerated into VF once more. ROSC to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) occurred shortly afterwards with one round of CPR and one AED-administered electrical shock at 300 J.Shortly after ROSC, repeat labs, CXR, and transthoracic echocardiography were obtained and unremarkable; all cardiac chambers were normal in function and size. In particular, LVEF was 60–65% without wall motion abnormalities and no signs of RVOT abnormalities were noted. Head CT was negative for hypoxic ischemic changes or other pathology. However, an ECG obtained during the first code blue showed ST-segment elevations with a curiously peaked downsloping shape in the anterolateral chest leads (Figure 1). Besides indicating a possible right fascicular blockade, this pattern suggested a critical underlying pathology.Patients diagnosed with BrS must satisfy both of the following criteria: (1) typical ECG findings of BrS and (2) clinical features at time of diagnosis. Often, this entails a spontaneous episode of syncope, VF, or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) preceding ECG findings suggestive of BrS. Alternatively, asymptomatic high-risk patients may undergo a monitored sodium channel blocker challenge; if aforementioned events occur during the test, an inferred diagnosis of BrS is made [1–3].Two types of Brugada ECG patterns exist: Type 1 consists of the hallmark “coved-type” ST-segment elevations with negative T-wave in at least one right precordial lead (V1-V2). Type 2 BrS has a “saddle back” ST-T-wave configuration with either an upright or biphasic T-wave.At least one of the following clinical requirements must be met: (a) history of VT/VF, (b) family history of SCD, (c) family history of coved-type ECG, (d) agonal respiration during sleep, or (5) inducibility of VT/VF during electrophysiological study. Those with BrS classically have normal cardiac structure and function on TTE and lack ischemic cardiomyopathy [1].In this patient’s case, his history and clinical findings are most consistent with Type 1 BrS. The classic coved-type ST-segment elevations are evident on ECG and there was positive personal history of VF arrest [2, 4]. Further investigation by our electrophysiologists confirmed the BrS diagnosis.Patients diagnosed with symptomatic BrS require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) as first-line management (Class I recommendation) [4, 5], which our patient received prior to discharge. Around the time of ICD placement and one week after initial presentation, the ECG findings suggestive of BrS disappeared without further intervention (Figure 2).Patients who experience appropriate recurrent ICD shocks may need additional pharmacological rhythm control, usually quinidine or amiodarone. Low-risk patients with only positive findings but lack symptoms or strong family history of sudden cardiac death should be monitored with regularly scheduled follow-up appointments without specific therapy. Patients without symptomatic BrS but have significant risk factors, such as positive family history, usually undergo further risk stratification with an invasive electrophysiological study [2, 4–6].In 1992, Pedro and Josep Brugada first described this autosomal dominant arrhythmia.in a series of eight patients who suffered from VF arrest. All ECGs from those patients possessed a characteristic right bundle-branch block with coved-type ST-segment elevation on ECG [7]. Years later, discovery of the SCN5A gene in 1998 provided further insight into this syndrome and association with sudden cardiac death (SCD). By encoding the fast-type sodium channel’s α-subunit, mutations in SCN5A led to slow conduction, particularly in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). To date, although over 10 genes have since been linked to BrS, SCN5A remains the most commonly associated gene. Ultimately, those with BrS usually suffer from syncopal episodes, palpitations, or SCD attributed to VF. Young adult men, who are nine times more likely than females to be affected, usually present after a syncopal episode. Coronary angiography, if performed, usually shows nonobstructive CAD. Additionally, family history is often significant for early cardiac death or early death without known cause [1–3, 6, 8].In this case, the patient presented later in life status post OHCA with minimal 1-vessel CAD and lacked familial cardiac disease history, unlike most textbook presentations. Moreover, despite a routine successful PCI, he suffered multiple subsequent VF arrests with return of ST-segment elevations with morphology consistent with Type I BrS.Notably, Brugada-type ECG changes can appear in various conditions, including fever, stress, certain medications, and acute ischemic lesions of the RVOT. Although the latter scenario may induce ST-elevations in right precordial leads, mimicking BrS, subsequent ventricular tachycardia (VT) or VF episodes occur in a subset of patients without obstructive CAD and/or with diagnosed BrS. Post-RVOT acute ischemia complicated by VT/VF has not been documented in cases with obstructive CAD [9]. Since this patient only had a marginal obstructive lesion of the RCA, the etiology of his initial cardiac arrest and subsequent VF episodes with coved-type ST-segment elevations is highly suspicious for BrS.BrS is a common yet preventable cause of SCD; hence, it is important to recognize its presentation and characteristic diagnostic findings. Though classically associated with patients presenting post OHCA without obstructive CAD, BrS may also initially present in a patient with mild CAD complicated by new-onset VT/VF and Brugada-pattern ECG post intervention. Such situations warrant further investigation with BrS in the differential.This submission represents original work that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.

Primary Carnitine Deficiency: A Rare, Reversible Metabolic Cardiomyopathy
Department of Cardiology, Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, Cnr Butterfield St and Bowen Bridge Road, Herston, QLD 4029, AustraliaCorrespondence should be addressed to Stephen Tomlinson; moc.liamg@9891nosnilmotnehpetsReceived 14 June 2018; Accepted 8 August 2018; Published 13 September 2018Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2018 Stephen Tomlinson et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 24-year-old female with a diagnosis of primary carnitine deficiency, a rare inherited metabolic disorder predominantly described in the paediatric literature that causes cardiomyopathy, presented for evaluation after three months of nonadherence with prescribed carnitine therapy. Initial echocardiography demonstrated severe left ventricular dilation (104 ml/m2) (normal < 76 ml/m2) with moderate systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 40%) and severe right ventricular dilation with mild systolic dysfunction. Carnitine replacement was commenced, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed five days later demonstrated dramatic improvement in biventricular function with normalization of left and right ventricular systolic function. To our knowledge, this is only the second case describing the rapid reversal of cardiomyopathy in an adult patient with this rare condition.A 24-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department of a tertiary hospital in Brisbane with a 48-hour history of diarrhoea and vomiting. Her medical history included primary carnitine deficiency, a rare inherited metabolic disorder that causes cardiomyopathy, which was diagnosed as asymptomatic during her infancy following the death of her infant brother from cardiomyopathy related to the condition. Her diagnosis was established by impaired cultured fibroblast carnitine uptake. Her genotype is unknown. She was prescribed oral carnitine replacement, 400 mg TDS, but had been not compliant with this therapy for the preceding three months. She reported no history suggestive of cardiac failure or arrhythmia. Cardiovascular and respiratory examination was normal. Chest X-ray revealed an increased cardiothoracic ratio. Electrocardiogram demonstrated enlarged peaked T waves and a short QT interval (Figure 1). Her serum total carnitine level was 4 μmol/l (21–70). Intravenous carnitine replacement was commenced, and she was admitted for telemetry and cardiac evaluation. Her gastrointestinal symptoms resolved early in her admission and did not reoccur.Echocardiography performed within 24 hours of commencing carnitine replacement revealed a dilated cardiomyopathy. The left ventricle was severely dilated with a left ventricular end diastolic volume index of 104 ml/m2 (normal < 76 ml/m2) with mild concentric wall thickening with a maximum wall thickness of 16 mm. The ejection fraction was 40% by Simpson’s method with global hypokinesis. Grade II diastolic dysfunction was present. The right ventricle was severely dilated with mild systolic dysfunction (Figure 2).The patient was transitioned from IV to PO carnitine, 400 mg TDS, and was commenced on bisoprolol 2.5 mg mane and perindopril 2.5 mg mane. Plasma carnitine concentration normalized within 24 hours and was sustained within normal limits for the duration of the admission on serial testing. Continuous telemetry monitoring demonstrated a single run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with a rate of 150 bpm. A CT coronary angiogram revealed no coronary atheroma. Screening for other causes of cardiomyopathy was not undertaken given the known carnitine deficiency.A cardiac MRI performed five days after the initial echocardiogram showed dramatic improvement in cardiac function. The left ventricular volume normalized, and the ejection fraction improved to 55%. The right ventricle normalized in size and function. Moderate concentric thickening of the left ventricle persisted with a maximum wall thickness of 17 mm. Delayed enhancement imaging was normal (Figure 3).Carnitine (3-hyrdoxy-4-N-trimethylaminobutyrate) is an amino acid compound that is essential for cellular metabolism. It facilitates transfer of cytosolic long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for B-oxidation, providing a substrate for the oxidative phosphorylation cascade. Primarily obtained from dietary sources such as meat and dairy, 99.5% of total body carnitine is stored intracellularly and 0.5% circulates as unbound carnitine in the plasma. Plasma carnitine is renally excreted via free filtration across the glomerulus but under normal conditions is highly conserved with 95–99% tubular resorption. Intracellular concentration and tubular resorption of carnitine are facilitated by OCTN2, a widely expressed high-affinity carnitine plasma transport protein. Dysfunction of OCTN2 leads to severe plasma and intracellular carnitine deficiency [1].Primary carnitine deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with an incidence of one in 120,000, caused by mutations in the SLC22A5 gene, located on chromosome 5q23.3, which encodes OCTN2 [2]. The disorder most commonly presents between the ages of two and four years with cardiac or hepatic failure, which may be fatal if untreated. Some patients, however, remain asymptomatic throughout their lives. Males and females are equally affected. On histology, an affected patient’s myocardium demonstrates massive lipid accumulation and fibrosis. Clinically, a dilated cardiomyopathy is observed [3].The unique characteristic of the condition, previously reported in the paediatric literature, is the rapid reversal of cardiac dysfunction which is possible after carnitine replacement. Wang et al. illustrate this characteristic in a series of six children with the condition with severe left ventricular dysfunction. After one month of carnitine treatment, left ventricular systolic function normalized in all six patients, and after six months of therapy, the left ventricular volume also normalized [3]. To our knowledge, our case is only the second publication that describes this remarkable clinical response in an adult [4].Findings on cardiac imaging are nonspecific. Echocardiography typically demonstrates left ventricular thickening, left ventricular dilation, depressed left ventricular systolic function, and thickening of mitral valve papillary muscles and trabeculae [5].Our case is only the second that describes MRI findings in an adult patient. The first published case described a 23-year-old woman with a 10-year history of intermittent and prolonged nonadherence with carnitine therapy. This patient’s MRI demonstrated patchy late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), implying myocardial fibrosis. The absence of any LGE in our patient is an important feature that differentiates the two cases, which we believe provides unique insight into the natural history of the condition. We suggest that sustained periods of carnitine nonadherence in the first patient resulted in myocardial necrosis due to prolonged alterations in cellular metabolism. Our patient, who had a comparatively brief interruption in her therapy, did not develop this, suggesting that myocardial damage can be prevented by continuous carnitine therapy. This suggestion is supported by other cases in the literature that describe appropriately treated adult patients with up to 30 years of follow-up without left ventricular dysfunction or malignant arrhythmia [3].The observed changes of enlarged peaked T waves and short QT interval seen in our patient are similar to those described in the paediatric cases and are characteristic of the condition. They are regarded as markers of electrical instability that predispose to ventricular arrhythmia. A majority of patients’ ECGs normalize after sustained normalization of plasma carnitine concentration; however, patients remain at increased risk of sudden cardiac death [6].The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
A Novel Double Side Branch Protection Technique for a Left Main Trifurcation Lesion: Simultaneous Jailed Balloon and Jailed Corsair Technique
1Department of Cardiology, Saitama Municipal Hospital, Saitama, Japan2Department of Cardiology, Japanese Red Cross Ashikaga Hospital, Ashikaga, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Yohei Numasawa; pj.ca.oiek.dem.tenpc@awasamunReceived 20 June 2018; Accepted 26 July 2018; Published 13 September 2018Academic Editor: Markus FerrariCopyright © 2018 Masahito Munakata et al.

Although side branch protection techniques such as the jailed balloon technique and jailed Corsair technique are the established methods for treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions, little is known regarding the application and feasibility of these techniques for left main trifurcation disease. We herein describe a 72-year-old man with angina pectoris who was successfully treated with percutaneous coronary stent implantation for a left main trifurcation lesion. In this case, we performed a novel double side branch protection technique, the simultaneous jailed balloon and jailed Corsair technique, with a single 8 Fr guiding catheter. This is the first case report to highlight the feasibility and efficacy of combined use of the jailed balloon and jailed Corsair techniques during percutaneous coronary intervention for left main trifurcation disease.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for left main trifurcation disease remains one of the most technically challenging procedures for interventional cardiologists, even with the currently available drug-eluting stents (DESs). In general, provisional stenting using the jailed wire technique is considered the standard method for most coronary bifurcation lesions [1]. However, even when a protective guide wire is inserted into the side branch prior to main vessel stenting, there remains a risk of side branch occlusion after stent implantation due to plaque or carina shift [2, 3]. To overcome these difficulties associated with PCI for bifurcation lesions, the jailed balloon technique and jailed Corsair technique have been established [3–9]. Although these techniques are useful, PCI is more complex for coronary trifurcation than bifurcation lesions [10–13], and little is known regarding the application and feasibility of these side branch protection techniques for left main trifurcation disease. We herein describe a 72-year-old man with angina pectoris who was successfully treated with percutaneous coronary stent implantation for a left main trifurcation lesion using the simultaneous jailed balloon and jailed Corsair technique.A 72-year-old man presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of chest pain on exertion. He had multiple coronary risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Electrocardiography revealed no clear findings of ischemic ST-T changes or prior Q-wave myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 63.3% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and no segmental wall motion abnormality. Coronary computed tomography angiography revealed a mixed plaque in the distal left main trifurcation with suspicion of significant stenosis. He was admitted to our hospital to undergo coronary angiography with a diagnosis of stable exertional angina pectoris.Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed distal left main trifurcation disease including significant stenosis in the distal left main trunk (LMT), ostial left anterior descending artery (LAD), and ostial left circumflex artery (LCX) (modified Medina classification 1-1-1-0) (Figure 1) [11]. No significant stenosis was present in the right coronary artery. Because the SYNTAX score was calculated as 15 [14] and the patient refused a surgical approach, PCI using a DES was planned. Because both the LCX and intermediate branch were large vessels, it was essential to preserve the blood flow of these side branches after main vessel stenting. Therefore, we decided to perform PCI using the simultaneous jailed balloon and jailed Corsair technique for this left main trifurcation lesion.After obtaining informed consent, PCI for the left main trifurcation lesion was performed. An 8 Fr AL 1.0 guiding catheter with a side hole (Hyperion; Asahi Intecc, Aichi, Japan) was engaged into the left coronary artery via the right femoral artery. A SION guide wire (Asahi Intecc) was initially inserted into the LAD. To protect the two large side branches, a Balance Middleweight Universal II guide wire (Abbott Vascular Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and a SION Blue guide wire (Asahi Intecc) with a Corsair Pro microcatheter (Asahi Intecc) were introduced into the intermediate branch and LCX, respectively (Figure 2(a)).According to the angiographic and intravascular ultrasound images, we decided to perform direct crossover stenting from the LMT to LAD using the simultaneous jailed balloon and jailed Corsair technique. A DES (SYNERGY 3.0 × 16 mm; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) was advanced into the LAD, and a semicompliant balloon (canPass 2.5 × 15 mm; Japan Lifeline, Tokyo, Japan) was advanced into the intermediate branch. Subsequently, a Corsair Pro microcatheter was introduced into the LCX. The simultaneous jailed balloon and jailed Corsair technique was then performed. The side branch balloon in the intermediate branch was initially inflated at low pressure (3 atm) (Figure 2(b)). The main branch stent balloon in the LMT to LAD was then inflated three times at nominal pressure (11 atm), which simultaneously jailed the side branch semi-inflated balloon in the intermediate branch and the Corsair Pro microcatheter in the LCX (Figure 2(c)). When the jailed Corsair Pro microcatheter was removed with rotation of the shaft, only small friction was felt. Blood flow was preserved in both the intermediate branch and the LCX after main vessel stenting, and there were no signs of plaque or carina shift into the side branches (Figure 2(d)).After reinsertion of a SION Black guide wire (Asahi Intecc) into the jailed intermediate branch via stent struts using a double-lumen catheter (Crusade K; Kaneka Medix, Osaka, Japan), kissing balloon inflation was performed with a 3.0 × 16 mm stent balloon in the LAD and a 2.5 × 15 mm canPass balloon in the intermediate branch (Figure 2(e)). Final kissing balloon angioplasty was then performed with a 3.0 × 16 mm stent balloon in the LAD and a 2.5 × 15 mm canPass balloon in the LCX (Figure 2(f)). A final coronary angiogram showed excellent results without any complications, including side branch narrowing or occlusion (Figure 3). The postprocedure course was uneventful, and no major complications including ischemic events, heart failure, or access-site complications were observed. The patient was discharged the day after the procedure, and his angina symptom completely disappeared after PCI.Because left main trifurcation was anatomically crucial, an early follow-up coronary angiography was performed 2 weeks after the procedure. It showed excellent results and no findings of restenosis in both the main vessel and side branches. In addition, fractional flow reserve (FFR) was measured and there were no signs of significant ischemia in both distal LAD (FFR: 0.88) and LCX (FFR: 1.00).This case report highlights the feasibility and efficacy of the simultaneous jailed balloon and jailed Corsair technique with a single 8 Fr guiding catheter for the treatment of left main trifurcation disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report detailing successful percutaneous coronary stent implantation using this technique.PCI for coronary bifurcation or trifurcation lesions, especially with left main trunk disease, remains challenging and is associated with a risk of side branch occlusion and a high rate of target lesion revascularization [11, 12]. The provisional stenting method using the jailed wire technique is generally recommended for most coronary bifurcation lesions [1]. However, side branch occlusion or side branch narrowing after main vessel stenting sometimes occurs because of plaque or carina shift, even when a protective guide wire is inserted into the side branch prior to stent implantation [2, 3]. Once the blood flow of the side branch is impaired, serious myocardial ischemia may develop along with chest pain and hemodynamic instability, even when the blood flow impairment is temporary [13]. Therefore, efforts to reduce the risk of temporary or chronic side branch occlusion during PCI are crucial. In addition, PCI is more complex for coronary trifurcation than for bifurcation lesions [10–13]. Although coronary artery bypass grafting surgery is generally recommended for patients with left main trifurcation disease, especially those with ostial plaque involvement of side branches, PCI may sometimes be required in selected patients with acute coronary syndrome at presentation and intolerance of or refusal to undergo a surgical approach mainly because of old age or systemic comorbidities [13].To overcome difficulties associated with PCI for bifurcation lesions, the jailed balloon technique and jailed Corsair technique have been established [3–9]. The jailed semi-inflated balloon technique provides a high rate of procedural success and preservation of the side branch blood flow after main vessel stenting mainly because it prevents carina or plaque shift [5, 8]. However, this technique is associated with potential risks including jailed balloon entrapment, balloon rupture, and dissection of the side branch ostium by balloon inflation even with low pressure. Compared with the jailed balloon technique, the jailed Corsair technique is more suitable for protecting a small side branch, and the risk of dissection at the ostium of the side branch is lower [9]. In addition, because the shaft of the Corsair Pro microcatheter has both high strength and excellent lubricity due to its hydrophilic coating, the risk of device entrapment is minimal. The concept of the jailed Corsair technique is consistent with the “keep it open strategy” stated in the consensus document of the European Bifurcation Club [1]. Taking these advantages and disadvantages of the jailed balloon technique and jailed Corsair technique into account, the combined use of these two techniques for left main trifurcation disease may be reasonable. Because the intermediate branch was larger than the LCX in this case, we simultaneously performed the jailed balloon technique in the intermediate branch and the jailed Corsair technique in the LCX during main vessel stenting.Our case report indicates that the basic treatment concepts for most coronary bifurcation lesions can be applied to trifurcation lesions including the jailed balloon and jailed Corsair technique. A provisional strategy with a single stent may also be a standard method, even in patients with left main trifurcation disease [11, 12], although the two side branches should be protected separately. In this situation, the simultaneous jailed balloon and jailed Corsair technique with a single 8 Fr guiding catheter is a useful alternative, as shown in this case report.The simultaneous jailed balloon and jailed Corsair technique has some limitations. First, this technique requires an 8 Fr guiding catheter for simultaneous insertion of a stent delivery system, balloon catheter, and Corsair microcatheter. Therefore, this technique cannot be performed via the radial artery. Second, because the proximal marker of the side branch balloon should be located more proximal to the stent edge to prevent entrapment [6, 8], a long balloon with double radiopaque markers is necessary. Finally, the use of a semi-inflated balloon or Corsair microcatheter for side branch protection is off-label, and it may also be associated with an increase in the total procedural cost.The simultaneous jailed balloon and jailed Corsair technique is a novel and effective double side branch protection technique for the treatment of left main trifurcation disease in selected patients. Further studies on this technique in larger populations are needed.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.We thank Angela Morben, DVM, ELS, from Edanz Group (http://www.edanzediting.com/ac), for editing a draft of this manuscript.
Cardiac Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma Requiring a Mitral Valve Replacement Complicated by Severe Paravalvular Leak: A Rare Case Report with Literature Review
1Internal Medicine Department, Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, USA2Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Rochester, MI, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Anju Adhikari; gro.tnomuaeb@irakihda.ujnaReceived 1 April 2018; Accepted 14 August 2018; Published 4 September 2018Academic Editor: Ertugrul ErcanCopyright © 2018 Anju Adhikari et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Cardiac sarcomas have a high infiltrative and metastatic potential and are often associated with poor prognosis. These tumors are often identified incidentally by thoracic and cardiac imaging. However, when symptomatic, their presentation can differ based on the localized structural effects on the endocardium, myocardium, pericardium, and valves as well as on dynamic effects on the cardiac function. We report a case of a 61-year-old female who presented to the emergency room with recurrent chest pain, fatigue, and chronic anemia. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a left atrial mass attached to the septal wall and anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The mass was further characterized by a transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac MRI. The patient underwent a resection of the left atrial mass with mitral valve replacement (MVR) and atrial septal defect repair. MVR was later complicated by paravalvular leak leading to acute congestive heart failure. Tissue immune histology was consistent with dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Cardiac dedifferentiated liposarcoma is extremely rare with only few cases reported in literature. We attempt to review the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of cardiac sarcoma with great emphasis.Cardiac tumors in general are relatively rare and can be either primary or secondary. Secondary cardiac involvement from metastasis and local extension are slightly more common, although still relatively rare when compared with other organ systems. Secondary metastatic tumors are commonly known to arise from the malignancies originating in the lungs, breast, kidney, skin, or lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) [1]. On the other hand, primary cardiac tumors are known to be extremely rare with some studies reporting less than 0.1 percent incidence [2].Primary cardiac tumors are commonly benign while malignant primary cardiac tumors remain very rare with autopsy series reporting a prevalence of 0.001% [3]. The Japanese Association of Thoracic Surgery (JATS) along with the Japanese Circulation Society (JCS) compiled a compendium of cardiac tumors from 1999 to 2010 [4]. They found that the most common benign cardiac tumor was myxoma (34.0–43.1%), followed by papillary fibroelastoma (11.4–17.7%). This was followed by lipoma and hemangioma in this order. On the other hand, they found that malignant cardiac tumors were most commonly angiosarcoma (8.2–9.5%), followed by fibrous histiocytoma and leiomyosarcoma. Cardiac dedifferentiated liposarcoma is extremely rare with less than 10 cases reported in the literature. It is a type of liposarcoma with an infiltrative and metastatic potential. We report a case of a female presenting with cardiac liposarcoma of primary cardiac origin.A 61-year-old female with past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia and family history of breast cancer in her brother and maternal aunt presented to the emergency room for recurrent chest pain. She also reported fatigue for the past few months and was being evaluated for worsening anemia by her primary care physician. Her hemoglobin was 6 gm/dl with iron panel consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) at arrival showed an “RSR pattern” in V1 and V2 leads but was otherwise normal. She underwent a stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) which was negative for cardiac ischemia. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a 1.6 cm × 1.5 cm atrial mass attached to the anterior wall of the left atrium, which appeared to cross the mitral valve in ventricular diastole. The left atrial mass was further characterized by a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) as a solid, irregularly shaped, partly mobile mass attached to the atrial septum and extending to the anterior mitral valve leaflet (Figure 1). The segment attached to the septum measured 2.6 cm × 1.43 cm, and the segment attached to the valve measured 1.4 cm × 2.22 cm. In addition, MRI of the heart with gadolinium was done preoperatively which confirmed the circumscribed hypodense mass with speckled appearance which originated at the atrial septum and extended along the anterior mitral valve leaflet (Figure 2). The mitral valve flow was normal with no evidence of obstruction, stenosis, or regurgitation. The patient underwent a minimal incision valve surgery for resection of the mass which was presumed to be myxoma due to its location. Intraoperatively, on open examination of the left atrium, it was noted that the mass originated from the fossa ovalis region of the interatrial septum and infiltrated the atrial wall down onto the entire anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. A fibrotic density that surrounded the tumor was also noted. The mass along with a portion of the interatrial septum and the mitral valve was resected. The mitral valve was replaced using a 27 mm Hancock II bioprosthetic valve. The atrial septal defect caused by the resection was repaired with a bovine pericardial patch. A postoperative TEE was performed which confirmed the successful placement of the bioprosthetic valve with no paravalvular leak. The patient had an otherwise unremarkable postoperative recovery and was discharged home after fourteen days of hospital stay.Two weeks following discharge, the patient presented to the emergency with cough, diaphoresis, and palpitations. She was noted to have jugular venous distention and bibasilar crackles on auscultation of the lungs and was found to be in acute heart failure. An urgent transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated severe mitral regurgitation with paravalvular leak (Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6). At the same time, the histopathologic examination of the atrial mass showed a high-grade sarcoma consistent with dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The tissue exhibited spindle cells with pleomorphism, multinucleated giant cells, and inflammatory cells. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated that the neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, focally positive for S-100, and weakly positive for CDK4 and negative for p53 (Figure 7). FISH studies performed showed an MDM-2 gene amplification in 95–200 nuclei examined. The patient was aggressively treated with intravenous diuretics and afterload reduction using furosemide and nicardipine infusion. Blood cultures were obtained with suspicion of postsurgical infective endocarditis causing valvular dehiscence. However, cultures did not grow any bacteria. The patient clinically deteriorated due to new-onset atrial fibrillation and worsening heart failure despite medical treatment in CCU. CT chest obtained showed a 1.3 cm lytic iliac bone lesion and 3.1 cm × 2.5 cm right upper mediastinal soft tissue density. Due to high suspicion of metastatic disease, MVR and cardiac transplant were not offered until further evaluation for metastasis. Unfortunately, due to rapid clinical decline with a new diagnosis of high-grade cardiac tumor with possible metastases, the patient opted for hospice care. PET study was not obtained.Among malignant cardiac tumors, cardiac sarcomas appear to be the most common. In a retrospective study done in Germany from 1989 to 2012 that looked at 181 diagnosed cardiac tumors, cardiac sarcoma represented 75% of all malignant cardiac tumors [5]. Histologically, soft tissue sarcomas in general have been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) to include more than 100 different histologic subtypes on the basis of the morphologic pattern most often noted on immunohistochemical staging (IHC) [6]. The most common soft tissue sarcoma subtypes in adults include undifferentiated/unclassified soft tissue sarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Liposarcoma constitutes only 13% of all cardiac sarcomas, arises from adipocytes, and has three main morphologic subgroups that vary in their metastatic potential according to 2013 WHO classification of soft tissue sarcoma: (1) myxoid, (2) dedifferentiated, and (3) pleomorphic liposarcoma [7]. Myxoid liposarcoma are low-grade tumors while dedifferentiated and pleomorphic liposarcomas are highly aggressive tumors. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma, as seen in our patient, is extremely rare with less than 10 reported cases in PubMed and Embase together (Table 1). However, dedifferentiated liposarcomas of the mediastinum, retroperitoneum, and extremities were more commonly reported.Common clinical symptoms of cardiac tumors include dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, hemoptysis, edema, and nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as fevers, chills, or fatigue, arthralgias, and myalgias [8]. Laboratory studies are inconsistent and may show anemia due to chronic disease, mildly elevated white blood cell count, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Tumors can cause direct obstruction, valvular dysfunction, coronary artery spasm, changes in the electrical conduction of the heart with arrhythmias, and production of a malignant pericardial effusion. Cardiac tumors may metastasize or embolize causing distant complications with brain infarction being a feared complication. One study on atrial myxomas reported as high as 12% incidence of central nervous system complications from left atrial tumors [9].Left atrial tumors are commonly presumed to be benign myxomas. Although left atrial tumors are commonly benign, the possibility of malignancy should always be considered given that 50% of cardiac sarcomas occur in the left atrium [10]. As shown in Table 1, most reported cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma arose in the left atrium. These tumors are known to impede blood flow and cause mitral valve obstruction. Clinically, patients often present with symptoms of heart failure or pulmonary hypertension (Table 1). Although not commonly reported, physical exam maneuvers may produce a tumor plop in early diastole.Evaluation for cardiac tumors rests heavily on imaging modalities. There are three major imaging modalities that aid with the diagnosis of cardiac tumors. Transthoracic echocardiography remains at the heart of diagnosing and screening of cardiac neoplasms as it has a high sensitivity and specificity (90% and 95%, respectively) for detecting intracavitary and endocardial lesions [1, 11]. TEE can be utilized for a more accurate evaluation as it provides superior spatial resolution and is optimal for tumors where areas such as the atria, interatrial septum, superior vena cava, and atrioventricular valves are difficult to visualize. In our patient, TEE provided a more accurate view of the tumor size, extent, and attachment than the initial TTE. MRI is currently the modality of choice to evaluate tissue infiltration, pericardial image, and extracardiac extension whenever a malignant lesion is suspected. Multidetector CT is a relatively new modality which produces images with higher spatial resolution in a shorter exposure span and also better demonstrates calcifications, fatty lesions, and cardiac valves [12]. Clinical signs and symptoms along with imaging can help formulate a presumed diagnosis of a cardiac tumor but, as seen in our patient, cannot be relied on to help differentiate between benign or metastatic diseases. The tumor stage and grade can only be made with histological confirmation. Minimally invasive techniques can be used if the malignancy is in pericardial fluid or if an imaging-guided percutaneous biopsy can be performed. However, in endocardial tumors, the risk of embolization often outweighs the benefits of biopsy of the tumor, given that the tumor will eventually be resected anyways. Of note, percutaneous needle biopsy is not adequate for the diagnosis and grade determination of lipomatous tumors. These tumors require larger tissue specimens obtained by incisional or excisional biopsy which further complicates and delays their diagnosis [5].Surgical resection with or without chemotherapy or radiotherapy remains the treatment of choice for cardiac malignancies including liposarcoma. Management begins by assessing the extent and size of tumor as that determines the approach to excise such tumors. Positron emission tomography (PET) as well as coronary angiography is important as mapping the blood supply of tumors helps cardiac surgeons know where to also resect or graft involved arteries. Simple tumor resection is selected for benign tumors with no infiltration while complex tumor resection and ex situ resection are utilized for malignant tumors. Implantation of an artificial heart and heart transplantation are reserved for young patients with no evidence of distant metastasis [5].Unfortunately, sarcomas in general, regardless of the morphologic type, are known to rapidly proliferate. They are known to infiltrate the myocardium, obstruct blood flow through the heart, and cause metastasis. In a study of 181 patients with cardiac tumors, among which 25% were malignant, the 5-year survival rates for malignant tumors following treatment was 30% [5]. The study also reported that complete tumor resection and adjuvant radiation therapy contributed to the reduced risk of local recurrence and metastasis. Specifically with liposarcoma, recurrence was seen in approximately 40% of the cases and was reported to be up to 14 years after the initial surgical resection [7].Our patient developed paraprosthetic leak following mitral valve replacement (MVR). Mild paravalvular leak (PVL) is a fairly common complication occurring in almost 20% post-MVR. Of note, however, clinically significant PVL occurs in only 1–5% [13]. Calcification and fibrosis of the annulus are known to increase the risk of PVL. On the other hand, it is well known that malignant tissue often displays fibrosis or calcification. Our patient had fibrotic changes around the atrial cancer which was easily noticed during resection. Hence, it is possible that the remnant friable malignant tissue or its sclerotic surrounding tissue might have contributed to the PVL in our patient leading to poor clinical outcome. Keeping in mind the limitations of echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, and CT in diagnosing a malignant tumor, we suggest the utilization of PET scan whenever malignancy is suspected. Presurgical diagnosis of malignant tumors would not only help surgeons plan a complete tumor resection and anticipate complications but would also allow neoadjuvant radiation or chemotherapy. At present, the prognosis of cardiac malignancy remains poor with high mortality and tumor recurrence. The advent of new modalities to diagnose cardiac malignancy before curative surgery could potentially decrease the mortality in the future.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.The authors would like to thank Kausar Jabbar, MD, Department of Clinical and Laboratory Pathology at Oakland University William Beaumont Hospital for the assistance with immunohistopathology images and description.

Transcutaneous Puncture of an Undeflatable Coronary Angioplasty Balloon Catheter

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.This case report describes a quick and safe method to successfully retrieve an undeflatable angioplasty balloon via the transradial access site. The article also presents potential mechanisms of contrast media entrapment and bench tests of guidewire-assisted balloon puncture. After successful stent implantation in the proximal right coronary artery in a 74-year-old female patient referred for acute coronary syndrome, the balloon catheter became undeflatable for an unknown reason. Several attempts to burst the balloon in the guide catheter and the aorta failed. After a pullback into the radial artery, the still inflated balloon became stuck again and was unable to be retrieved through the sheath. Finally, transcutaneous puncture and aspiration of contrast media with a 23 gauge syringe needle through the skin in the right forearm allowed deflation and successful removal the balloon.Transradial access for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) has become more frequent in recent years [1]. In particular, patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), and cardiogenic shock benefit from the radial approach [2–8]. Based on these studies, the latest ESC guidelines recommend the transradial access for the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (class I, level A) [9]. Radial access is also associated with reduced incidence of acute kidney injury after PCI [10].Optimized guide support, the latest guidewire and balloon technologies, and additional accessories such as extension catheters provide enough backup to successfully cross severely calcified lesions via the radial route. However, more complex procedures inevitably result in more complications. Smaller-sized guide catheters with the radial approach may limit the ability to remove damaged gear through the access site. Undeployed or lost stents, broken guidewires, twisted guiding catheters, trapped balloon catheters, and other interventional tools have been successfully removed by the femoral access or cardiac surgery [11]. Only a few reports describing true transradial bailout methods have been published [12]. The use of large balloon diameters and lengths concurrently with smaller guiding catheters may further increase complication rates.This case report describes an easy method for successful transradial retrieval of an undeflatable 3.5/48 balloon catheter using transcutaneous puncture and contrast aspiration in the forearm.A 74-year-old female patient with an acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was referred for coronary angiography. Transradial access was established with a 10 cm 6F Introducer sheath (Glidesheath, Terumo Medical Corporation). Coronary angiography with a 6F Judkins right 4 diagnostic catheter revealed a long and heavily calcified lesion of the proximal segment and ostium of the right coronary artery (RCA). During the retrieval of the diagnostic catheter, the patient complained of severe pain in her right arm due to spasm of the radial artery. After repetitive intravenous administration of midazolam up to 8 mg and nitroglycerine through the radial sheath, retrieval of the catheter was finally possible. PCI of the lesion in the proximal RCA was then performed over a 5F Amplatz left 1 guiding catheter (Launcher, Medtronic) using an extra support guidewire (Galeo ES, Biotronik) and a 3.0/15 semi compliant balloon (Across HP, Acrostak) for predilatation. A 3.5/48 drug-eluting stent (DES) (XIENCE Xpedition, Abbot Vascular) was then placed in the predilated coronary segment and inflated to 18 atm (Figure 1(a)). A mixture of contrast media and saline at a ratio of 1 : 1 was used for all balloon inflations. After a second more proximal inflation, the balloon catheter did not deflate completely and the operator was unable to pull it back into the 5F guiding catheter (Figure 1(b)). Excessive inflation and deflation with the indeflator and forced aspiration with a 50 ml syringe were unable to deflate the balloon that was stuck at the RCA ostium. The operator then decided to pull back the entire equipment including the guiding catheter, guidewire, and stent balloon at once. Finally, the balloon catheter became released from the stent remaining in place in the coronary artery. An attempt to burst the balloon in the ascending aorta by inflation well over rated burst pressure (RBP), as well as puncturing the balloon within the guide catheter with multiple stiff guidewires, also failed.During a further pullback of the system, the still inflated balloon became stuck again in the small and vasospastic radial artery. The operator was unable to pull or push the balloon in any direction and was unable to wedge the balloon into the 6F radial sheath. Moreover, a forced pullback of the partially inflated balloon catheter resulted in invagination of the distal part of the balloon (Figure 1(c), white arrow). After injecting local anesthesia on the middle forearm, transcutaneous puncture of the balloon through the skin and the radial artery wall was performed with a 23 gauge syringe needle using fluoroscopy for guidance (Figure 1(d)), and contrast media were aspirated with the syringe (Figure 1(e)). Retrieval of the deflated balloon was then possible through the radial sheath. Reintubation of the RCA with a fresh guiding catheter revealed a good angiographic result in the proximal segment and relevant acute recoil at the ostium of the calcified RCA. Implantation of a second short 4.0/9 mm DES (BMX-Alpha, Biosensors) was necessary to mechanically stabilize the lesion. Injection of contrast media through the sheath confirmed the integrity of the radial artery at the puncture site (Figure 1(f)). Radial compression was used to close the 6F access site. The clinical follow-up remained uneventful.The presented case describes a quick and safe method to successfully retrieve an undeflatable angioplasty balloon via the transradial access site. Transcutaneous puncture can easily be performed by palpation of the balloon or using fluoroscopy for guidance. Puncture of the balloon catheter alone may be sufficient for retrieval through the sheath; however, aspiration of contrast media with the syringe facilitates balloon deflation and may be beneficial.Contrast media exit the balloon at the proximal end (Figure 2) and flows through the flexible distal part of the catheter shaft and then through the metallic hypotube. Viscosity plays an important role with deflation time depending on the mixing ratio between contrast media and saline solution [13]. Potential mechanisms of contrast media entrapment in angioplasty balloons are illustrated in Figure 3 and include (A) acute recoil of a severely calcified lesion after balloon inflation with compression of the deflating balloon around the entry port; (B) strangulation of the proximal end of the balloon by the guiding catheter after the early pullback of the balloon catheter before complete deflation; and (C) damage to the hypotube. The final common scenario is that the balloon can only be partially deflated due to the entrapment of contrast media, which further complicates retrieval of the balloon catheter. In the first two situations, contrast media collect in the distal part of the balloon and this can complicate balloon retrieval. Only the third mechanism explains all features observed in the current case including distal deflation of the balloon and inability to inflate the balloon again. In the present case, however, a collection of contrast media in the proximal part could also have been a result from incomplete deaeration prior to initial inflation. The heavily calcified ostium and the acute recoil after stent implantation were very likely the reason for the balloon entrapment. Longitudinal stent compression (LSC) is frequently found in ostial lesions and may further complicate acute recoil and removal of the distally placed gear [14]. However, no angiographic characteristics of LSC were found in the present case.A classic bailout method for undeflatable angioplasty balloons includes prolonged/forced balloon inflation well above rated burst pressures (RBP) to intentionally burst the balloon. This maneuver should be performed in a large vessel such as the ascending aorta or subclavian artery to avoid rupture of the coronary artery. This can be difficult with noncompliant (NC) and other high and very high-pressure balloons such as the OPN NC (SIS Medical, Switzerland) that can withstand up to 50 atm. The fact that inflation was also impossible suggests that the hypotube was obstructed or damaged and no contrast was able to flow in or out of the balloon. However, a close examination of the balloon catheter did not reveal a definite mechanism of failure in this case.Other potential methods such as transluminal puncture of the balloon at its proximal end within the guide catheter with hard wires like the Gaia 3rd, Confianza Pro 12, Stingray guidewire (stiff wire with 0.0035-inch distal taper), or even the back end of a guidewire failed in bench tests (Figure 4). Even increasing the penetration force with the use of an additional microcatheter failed and is therefore not recommended in such cases. Similar to the present case, Watt and associates also were unable to puncture the balloon using a stiff guidewire and instead had to cut the kinked hypotube to passively let the balloon deflate [15]. Finally, successful balloon puncture is only feasible with a pointed and cut 23 gauge syringe needle and does not leave any damage to the radial artery wall.Balloon catheters becoming undeflatable are extremely rare complications of PCI. A forced pullback of the balloon catheter of an undeflated balloon may cause the outer body of the distal shaft to shrink, forming a seal with the underlying tube of the distal shaft. At this stage, inflation may help to overcome this seal but may remain permanent once the distal shaft has ruptured. Ruptured balloon shafts leave the balloon behind in the coronary artery, and these cases cannot be resolved with this method.An easy pullback into large sheaths commonly used in femoral access may account for the rare complication reports. In one published case, the operators were able to retrieve the balloon from the coronary artery and pull it into a 6F femoral sheath [16]. The present case, however, describes a true transradial bailout method without additional access. Using a 5F guide catheter may likely have contributed to the damage of the hypotube in this case. The use of sheathless catheters with a larger lumen may facilitate PCI and further reduce these complications with the radial approach.Transcutaneous puncture of an undeflatable balloon catheter in the forearm is feasible and safe and may be considered a true/primary transradial retrieval method.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
A Case of Lyme Carditis Presenting with Atrial Fibrillation
1Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA2Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA3Department of Cardiology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Hadi Halazun; ude.llenroc.dem@1007hjhReceived 26 April 2018; Revised 10 July 2018; Accepted 2 August 2018; Published 2 September 2018Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2018 Peter J. Kennel et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We report a case of a 20-year-old man who presented to our institution with a new arrhythmia on a routine EKG. Serial EKG tracings revealed various abnormal rhythms such as episodes of atrial fibrillation, profound first degree AV block, and type I second degree AV block. He was found to have positive serologies for Borrelia burgdorferi. After initiation of antibiotic therapy, the atrial arrhythmias and AV block resolved. Here, we present a case of Lyme carditis presenting with atrial fibrillation, a highly unusual presentation of Lyme carditis.Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the United States [1]. In 2016, 26,203 confirmed diagnoses of Lyme disease were reported [2]. The incidence of Lyme disease has been consistent over the last decade at approximately 8 cases per 100,000 persons in the US with 95% of confirmed Lyme disease cases reported from only 14 states, mostly in the Northeast region of the US. The most common clinical presentation of Lyme disease is erythema migrans (70%), followed by arthritis (30%), Bell’s palsy (9%), radiculoneuropathy (4%), and meningitis/encephalitis (2%). Only 1% present with cardiac manifestations [3]. Cardiac manifestations of Lyme disease are rare but well described. Lyme carditis (LC) occurs in 0.3–4% of untreated adults with Lyme disease in Europe and in 1.5–10% of untreated adult patients in the United States [4]. For reasons yet to be determined, there is a male predominance of 3 to 1 in LC [5]. Cardiac involvement occurs during the early, disseminated phase of the disease [5], and cardiac symptoms can develop between the 7th day and the 7th month (median 21 days) after the onset of erythema migrans [4, 6]. Pathophysiologically, myocardial biopsy specimens usually show transmural inflammatory infiltrates with characteristic endocardial lymphocytic infiltrates and occasionally spirochetes [7]. Most cases of LC appear to be clinically asymptomatic. If symptomatic, typical presentations may be complaints of fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, and chest pain [8]. LC usually has a benign clinical course with complete resolution of symptoms. However, serious and even fatal cardiac complications have been reported, including fatal cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, cardiac tamponade, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death [4]. The typical cardiac presentations are various degrees of atrioventricular block [8, 9]. Rarely, LC has been reported to cause isolated bundle branch blocks or other conduction abnormalities [4, 8, 10]. There are rare reports of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias associated with LC. A recent case reported by Frank et al. describes a new-onset junctional tachycardia in a pediatric case of LC [11]. In another recent publication, Wenger et al. report a case of an adult man presenting with atrial fibrillation, complete atrioventricular block, and escape rhythm attributed to LC [12]. Here, we report a case of a young adult man with Lyme disease presenting with atrial fibrillation, profound first degree AV block, and type I second degree AV block.A 20-year-old man was referred to our institution from an oncological clinic where he was undergoing maintenance chemotherapy for metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. In routine EKG, there was concerning new EKG abnormalities with a possible new AV block. Prior EKGs had been without abnormal findings (Figure 1). Given the new EKG changes, the patient was admitted to an outside hospital for observation. Prior to his admission, the patient had been asymptomatic and had unlimited exercise capacity. He denied any tick bites or rashes in the recent past but reported that he had been hiking over the summer in Orange County, NY.The patient had a medical history of left forearm alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, diagnosed 16 months prior to this presentation for which he had undergone radiation therapy to his arm and chemotherapy including irinotecan, carboplatin, vincristine, doxorubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m2; initial regimen, which had been completed), and a combination of cyclophosphamide, vinorelbine, and temsirolimus (maintenance chemotherapy regimen). Recent imaging including PET had shown no evidence of disease, and the patient was deemed to be in remission at the time of presentation. The patient’s baseline EKG prior to his presentation showed a normal sinus rhythm with a PR interval of 152 msec (Figure 1).The patient’s home medications were sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim prophylaxis, cyclophosphamide, and zolpidem. He was a lifetime nonsmoker, did not consume alcohol or illicit drugs, and lived with his family with no cardiac family history.On arrival to our institution, the patient was asymptomatic. His blood pressure was 108/63 mmHg, heart rate was regular and between 80 and 115 bpm, he was afebrile at 36.4°C, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. His physical exam was unremarkable, with no cardiopulmonary findings, no focal neurological deficits, and no abnormal skin findings. The initial EKG on admission revealed coarse atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 60 beats per minute (Figure 2).Initial laboratory results were only notable for a hemoglobin of 10.0 mg/dl, a mild relative lymphocytopenia with a normal white blood cell count. TSH and troponin I levels were within normal limits. Echocardiogram showed normal left and right heart function with no wall motion abnormalities, mild tricuspid valve regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion.A cardiac MRI, performed 2 days after presentation, showed mild right atrial dilatation and no other abnormalities. In particular, no signs of inflammation or masses were found. Additionally, on hospital day 2, telemetry monitoring and EKG revealed spontaneous conversion to normal sinus rhythm with a profoundly prolonged PR interval of 460 msec (Figure 3).Further workup during the hospital course revealed a twice positive B. burgdorferi IgG and IgM immunoblot (performed at ARUP Laboratories; IgG: bands present: 66, 45, 41, 39, 23, and 18 kDa, IgM: bands present: 41 and 39 kDa).Given the positive Lyme serology in the setting of a new AV block and atrial fibrillation, antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone (2 grams every 24 h) was initiated. The patient was monitored with daily EKGs and continued telemetry monitoring. Telemetry showed intermittent episodes of abrupt changes from relatively short to long PR intervals. Figure 4 shows an abrupt spontaneous shift from short to long PR. Abrupt shortening of the PR interval occurred following a late-coupled spontaneous premature ventricular complex (PVC) consistent with retrograde concealed conduction into the AV node facilitating antegrade fast pathway conduction on the subsequent beats.On continued antibiotic therapy, the patient remained in sinus rhythm with shortening PR intervals to 390 msec on the day of discharge. The patient was discharged with a 21-day course of home IV ceftriaxone, a home telemetry monitor, and close follow-up with our electrophysiology clinic.At home, an event monitor for 1 week showed no advanced AV block or profound bradycardia. Recorded events were a HR 53 to 137 bpm, average 85 bpm, 147 supraventricular runs up to 33 beats; no advanced AV blocks were recorded. Over the course of his antibiotic therapy, the PR interval on serial EKG recordings shortened from 460 msec on admission to 184 msec after 3 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone, without any evidence of episodes of higher degree AV blocks (Figure 5). At the end of his treatment, the PR intervals were consistently short.Here, we report a case of a young adult man with Lyme disease presenting with atrial fibrillation, profound first degree AV block, and type I second degree AV block. This is an unusual presentation of LC, in which AV block is a known entity; however, atrial fibrillation is highly unusual. Lyme disease is an overall rare disease with only around 26,000 cases reported in the US per year. Only around 4% of these cases will develop LC. Among these patients, the vast majority experiences some degree of AV block. To our knowledge, there are only anecdotal reports of LC presenting with supraventricular arrhythmias as we describe in the case at hand. Of note, the patient also had alterations in his PR interval, sometimes occurring from one beat to the next. This pattern suggests the presence of dual AV nodal physiology whereby abrupt PR prolongation occurs following antegrade block in the fast pathway. Dual atrial inputs are likely to be an intrinsic property of the AV node, but this manifestation of abrupt PR changes is rarely seen in normal individuals. Interestingly, this phenomenon has been reported as a manifestation of Lyme disease in another case report [13]. Decremental physiology of the fast pathway is favored by gradual PR prolongation until block occurs in the fast pathway and conduction proceeds down a slow AV nodal pathway. It is possible that Lyme carditis preferentially affected particular components of the AV node associated with the fast pathway.While the patient was diagnosed with LC, a rare presentation of a rare disease, his past medical history was also notable for ARMS, a rare pediatric malignancy, which has an incidence of around 1 per 1 million. Notably, the patient was diagnosed with stage 4 disease with an overall poor prognosis, but underwent an experimental radio-chemotherapeutic protocol and was deemed free of disease after completion of the treatment. Given his prior exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs, cardiotoxic effects of these agents needed to be reviewed as possible causes for his new-onset arrhythmias: the experimental chemotherapeutic regimen consisted of irinotecan, carboplatin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and vinorelbine, and doxorubicin (Clinical Trials Identifier NCT00077285). While the aforementioned drugs are not associated with cardiotoxic effects, doxorubicin is known to be cardiotoxic and can cause atrial fibrillation [14]. However, atrial fibrillation would usually present as an acute cardiotoxic effect and unlikely as delayed cardiotoxicity. The patient had completed the chemotherapeutic regimen containing doxorubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m2) around a year prior to the onset of atrial arrhythmias, and MRI and echocardiogram did not show signs of myocarditis or heart failure. Furthermore, the patient was exposed to a low cumulative dose of doxorubicine. Cardiac complications at comparable doses have been found to be as low as 0–2.8% [15]. Hence, it appears unlikely that the chemotherapeutic agents contributed to the cardiac findings.Other rare differential diagnoses to consider in this case may be other causes for myocarditis or cardiomyopathies, familial syndromes such as Lenegre disease, cardiac tumors given his history of rhabdomyosarcoma, or syndromes in the rheumatologic realm. However, an extensive workup including cardiac MRI showing no evidence of structural abnormalities, signs of inflammation, or heart failure, repeat echocardiogram, and serologic studies including troponin, RPR, and toxoplasmosis remained unrevealing.Our case report is limited in that we are unable to conclusively identify the cause of the new-onset atrial fibrillation in this patient as, even though serologies and response to antibiotic treatment hint towards LC being the cause for the arrhythmia, other causes cannot be excluded. Of note, given the finding of mild atrial dilation on cardiac MRI, it is possible that LC could have been a “second hit” in the setting of a preexisting abnormal substrate.In summary, LC needs to be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with new-onset supraventricular arrhythmias if they may have been exposed to vectors of borrelia or live in endemic areas.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.We thank Dr. Viktor Gamarnik and Donavan White for their contribution.
Coil Embolization of Coronary-Cameral Fistula Complicating Revascularization of Chronic Total Occlusion
1Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beaumont Health System, Royal Oak, MI, USA2Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Royal Oak, MI, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Ivan Hanson; gro.tnomuaeb@nosnah.naviReceived 21 February 2018; Accepted 5 June 2018; Published 29 August 2018Academic Editor: Ramazan AkdemirCopyright © 2018 Amy Mertens et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Traumatic vessel perforation is a potential complication of chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary artery intervention (PCI). A rare consequence of this complication is a coronary-cameral fistula. The management of this condition is not well elucidated. Herein, we present such a case of symptomatic left anterior descending to the right ventricle (LAD-RV) fistula which was treated with coil embolization.Coronary artery chronic total occlusion (CTO) is present in 18–26% of all patients with coronary disease and in up to 50% of patients after coronary artery bypass grafting [1, 2]. These procedures are known to have higher complication rates compared to traditional PCI and require careful procedural planning and case selection for success. Potential complications include coronary perforation with or without tamponade due to equipment exit or stent overdilation, vessel thrombosis or occlusion, high radiation exposure leading to skin injury, vascular access complications, and contrast nephropathy [3]. Iatrogenic coronary artery fistulas are seen in only 0.25% of cases and typically involve coronary artery to coronary vein communication [4, 5]. We present a case of a left anterior descending (LAD) artery to the right ventricle (RV) fistula complicating a LAD CTO revascularization.A 71-year-old man with progressive angina was found to have severe stenosis in the circumflex artery and complex CTO of the left anterior descending artery (Figure 1, Supplementary Video 1). Coronary artery bypass surgery was offered to the patient but declined. He underwent uncomplicated stenting of the circumflex artery, followed by staged CTO recanalization of the LAD. A guidewire was passed relatively easily across the occlusion into the true lumen of the distal LAD beyond the bifurcation. Antegrade wiring of the diagonal artery was difficult. An epicardial collateral from the distal right coronary artery was used to access the diagonal branch retrograde, and this wire was steered into the antegrade guide catheter and externalized (Figure 2). Both the LAD and diagonal were dilated with 3.0 mm noncompliant balloons. The diagonal was stented into the proximal LAD, and the distal LAD was rewired. The distal LAD was dilated through the stent struts to allow passage of stents into the distal LAD (Culotte technique). The distal LAD was stented using four everolimus drug-eluting stents. The stents were postdilated with 3.0 mm noncompliant balloons in the diagonal and distal LAD and 4.0 mm noncompliant balloon in the proximal LAD. Within the distal-most stent in the distal LAD, the balloon had a persistent waist until an inflation pressure of 12 ATM. At that point, the balloon suddenly expanded. Angiography revealed contrast filling of the right ventricle (RV), with the appearance of one or two focal jets of contrast extravasation at the location of the rigid lesion in the distal LAD, consistent with iatrogenic LAD-RV fistula (Figure 3, Supplementary Video 2). Of note, the flow beyond the stents in the distal LAD was not seen, likely due to shunt flow and “coronary steal.” The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was asymptomatic, and it was elected to manage the fistula conservatively. Serial echocardiograms revealed only trace pericardial effusion. He was discharged in stable condition.Approximately three weeks after the CTO procedure, the patient was presented to the emergency department with chest pain and dyspnea. He described several episodes of “tearing” sensation in the chest. Blood pressure and heart rate were 123/69 mmHg and 64 beats per minute, respectively. A 12-lead ECG revealed inferior T wave inversion. Troponin I was elevated to 0.06 ng/mL. Urgent coronary angiography was performed, which revealed patent stents in the proximal LAD and diagonal branch. LAD-RV fistula appeared relatively unchanged compared to during the CTO procedure (Figure 3). The right coronary artery was normal and provided a very faint collateral to the apical LAD. Left ventriculography in the left anterior oblique projection revealed no evidence of a ventricular septal defect. The patient developed profound hypotension of unclear etiology during angiography. A right heart catheterization revealed normal filling pressures, normal cardiac output and ratio of pulmonic to systemic flow (Qp:Qs) 1.7. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction and normal left ventricular wall motion with turbulent flow signals at the LV and RV apex throughout the cardiac cycle (Supplementary Video 3). There was no pericardial effusion. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit in stable condition.Heart team evaluation was undertaken, and it was decided to perform coil embolization of the distal LAD. A standard 6 French left coronary guide catheter was used to advance a ProGreat (Terumo Medical Corp., Somerset, New Jersey) guidewire and 2.8 French catheter into the distal LAD. This was used to deploy two Ruby (Penumbra, Inc., Alameda, California) coils at the distal end of the stent.There was still persistent shunt flow, so two Tornado (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana) coils were subsequently deployed. Angiogram of the LAD confirmed complete cessation of flow into the distal LAD and absence of shunt flow (Figure 4, Supplementary Video 4). Hemodynamics postprocedure demonstrated a 20 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure and normalization of Qp:Qs. A follow-up echocardiogram revealed the obliteration of apical shunt flow, normal left ventricular ejection fraction, and no left ventricular wall motion abnormalities. Creatine kinase eight-hour postprocedure was normal. The patient was discharged home in stable condition. At follow-up, one month later, the patient remained asymptomatic.To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a traumatic LAD to RV fistula precipitated by CTO PCI that was successfully closed with percutaneous coil embolization. There have been 3 other reported cases of iatrogenic coronary artery fistulae in the literature, two of which were caused by RCA guidewire perforation and one secondary to LAD stent deployment [6, 7].Development of LAD-RV fistula in this patient may have related to stent/balloon oversizing and rupture of the relatively small distal vessel. It is conceivable that the distal LAD had an intramyocardial course, which could explain why flow was preferentially tracked into RV, and not the pericardial space. The symptoms of chest pain, described as “tearing,” along with low-level troponin release, may have been caused by the ongoing myocardial rupture. Although there was a significant shunting, there was no evidence of typical angina, which may have been expected if coronary steal had occurred [8].Definitive management of symptomatic coronary-cameral fistula has not been well elucidated. Approaches may include conservative management, surgical ligation, prolonged balloon inflation, covered stents, and device embolization [9, 10].The GRAFTMASTER (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California) is a polytetrafluoroethylene- (PTFE-) covered stent that can be delivered into the coronary arteries via a 6 French guide catheter. The crimped profile of the device is 1.63–1.73 mm, making it difficult to deliver in tortuous or calcified/stented vessels. The smallest expanded stent diameter is 2.8 mm, so for smaller vessels, it is less useful. In addition, the GRAFTMASTER requires guidewire “purchase” beyond the site of deployment, but in the present case, distal intraluminal guidewire position could not be confirmed. Deployment of a covered stent has a potential advantage of maintaining distal flow in the vessel beyond the treatment site. If covered stent deployment is not possible, device embolization can be considered.Coil embolization requires placement of a delivery catheter to the segment of interest, followed by advancement of coils, which are initially elongated and then conformed to their prespecified shape and volume once they are extruded. Ruby is a detachable coil, so it can be withdrawn or completely removed if needed. This type of coil was selected for initial delivery in the present case in order to achieve a precise position and avoid extension of the coil into the fistula tract or RV. Tornado is available in thickness as small as 0.018″ and is coated with thrombogenic fronds to promote faster hemostasis. It is not detachable.In the present case, distal LAD embolization resulted in complete occlusion of the stented segment beyond the large diagonal branch. It is important to note that embolization may not have been the preferred strategy if the perforation had occurred in a larger vessel or one supplying a large myocardial territory. The lack of a rise in cardiac biomarkers and the absence of left ventricular wall motion abnormalities suggested that the apical LAD and interventricular septum were adequately collateralized. Finally, the large diagonal branch, which was felt to be a more important vessel due to its large size and myocardial territory, was preserved.Traumatic vessel perforation leading to LAD-RV fistula is a potential complication of CTO PCI and may lead to untoward symptoms and significant intracardiac shunting. A working knowledge of transcatheter closure techniques, including covered stents and device embolization, is mandatory for coronary interventionalists and CTO operators in particular.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Supplementary Video 1: Left coronary angiography demonstrating severe stenosis of the left circumflex artery and CTO of the LAD.

Bevacizumab: A Rare Cause of Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Left ventricular dysfunction is a rare side effect of bevacizumab occurring in 2–4% of cases. We report the case of a 68-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of shortness of breath, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She was tachypneic and in respiratory distress. Physical examination revealed jugular venous distention, diffuse expiratory wheeze, and bipedal edema. She had been started on bevacizumab for the treatment of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 month prior to presentation. Laboratory tests revealed BNP of 1697 pg/ml with slightly elevated troponin 0.05 ng/ml. Chest X-ray showed interstitial edema with cardiomegaly, and transthoracic echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of 30% with global hypokinesia. Left heart catheterization revealed widely patent coronary arteries. Flash pulmonary edema secondary to acute left ventricular dysfunction in this case was attributed to recent treatment with bevacizumab after ruling out other possible etiologies. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of this rare but potentially reversible side effect of bevacizumab to prevent long-term sequelae.Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [1]. VEGF plays an important role in developmental angiogenesis [2]. Substantial evidence also implicates VEGF as a mediator of pathologic angiogenesis—a hallmark feature of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) [3]. Bevacizumab is approved by the FDA as first-line treatment for a wide range of ophthalmologic diseases and malignancies, including glioblastoma, breast cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer [4]. In addition, it is also used as off-label treatment of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related refractory bleeding [5]. The main cardiovascular side effects of bevacizumab include hypertension, bleeding, and venous and arterial thromboembolism [4]. In about 2–4% of cases, bevacizumab causes reversible cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dysfunction even in patients without preexisting cardiac disease [6]. Prompt recognition and early treatment with guideline-directed medical therapy along with bevacizumab discontinuation are crucial in treating this potentially reversible but fatal side effect.A 68-year-old woman with past medical history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage 3, hyperlipidemia, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath. She also reported chest pain, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Review of systems was otherwise unremarkable. Her HHT was previously managed by regular blood transfusions and epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Because of the need for frequent blood transfusion due to persistent epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding, she was started on bevacizumab infusion at 15 mg/kg/dose (1150 mg total) by her haematologist a month prior to presentation. Initial vital signs on presentation revealed respiratory rate of 25/min, oxygen saturation of 65% on ambient air, blood pressure of 138/83 mmHg, and pulse rate of 92/min. Physical examination revealed respiratory distress with diffuse wheeze, jugular venous distention, and trace pedal edema. Laboratory tests revealed markedly elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 1697 pg/ml (normal 0–100 pg/ml) with initial troponin of 0.05 ng/ml (normal < 0.04 ng/ml). Chest X-ray revealed pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema with mild cardiomegaly. She was immediately placed on noninvasive ventilation and started on intravenous furosemide with quick symptomatic improvement. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed ejection fraction of 30% and global hypokinesia (please see Supplementary Materials (available here)). Of note, TTE done three years prior to index presentation showed ejection fraction of 56%. She does not drink alcohol, and her thyroid function and sedimentation rate were normal making other etiologies of acute systolic heart failure such as thyroid disorder, alcoholic, or inflammatory cardiomyopathy less likely.She refused to wear LifeVest and was placed on guideline-directed medical therapy including beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), and aldosterone antagonist along with an oral diuretic. The patient progressively improved and was discharged three days later and scheduled for follow-up with cardiology for outpatient right and left heart catheterization. Two weeks later, she developed another episode of flash pulmonary edema deemed to be due to medication noncompliance. On this occasion, she underwent left and right heart catheterization which revealed widely patent coronary vessels (Figure 1), elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. She continued to have her monthly bevacizumab infusions with her haematologist as this was not thought to be the cause of her cardiomyopathy at the time. Three months later, she developed sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath at home and went into ventricular fibrillation-related cardiac arrest. She underwent prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation but eventually had return of spontaneous circulation. She was intubated and admitted to the medical intensive care unit and underwent therapeutic hypothermia. Repeat TTE showed ejection fraction of 34%. She quietly passed away 3 days later.Drug-induced cardiotoxicity usually manifests as heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It is commonly caused by chemotherapeutic medications such as anthracyclines and alkylating agents but is becoming increasingly reported among biologic drugs such as trastuzumab and bevacizumab [7].Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody containing human framework regions and murine complementarity-determining regions. By binding to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), bevacizumab prevents interaction with its receptors (Flt-1 and KDR) on endothelial cell surfaces therefore inhibiting angiogenesis [4]. Bevacizumab has shown promising activity and improve survival of patients with metastatic colon cancer, nonsquamous non-small-cell lung carcinoma, and metastatic breast cancer. Although not FDA-approved, systemic therapy with bevacizumab is a recognized treatment for severe forms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) [5] as was the case in our patient.Common side effects include bowel perforations, haemorrhage, delayed wound healing, hypertension, and venous and arterial thromboembolism. Left ventricular dysfunction is a rarely reported side effect of bevacizumab with an incidence of 1.2%, and this occurs irrespective of the route of administration [6].In this case, the probability of causal relationship of acute left ventricular dysfunction and bevacizumab can be rated as certain based on the World Health Organization and the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) algorithm [8].As with other antineoplastic medications, the pathogenesis of left ventricular dysfunction is unknown. Several mechanisms have been proposed including the formation of free radicals in the myocardium and inflammatory cytokines with resultant cardiac depression and congestive heart failure [9]. This side effect appears to be dose dependent, and management involves dose adjustment. Management also involves guideline-directed medical therapy with ACEi/ARBs, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists together with diuretics. Notably patients sick enough to require these medications also have increased risk of toxicity from these medications. Other forms of cardiomyopathies such as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy have also been reported following commencement of bevacizumab [10].Serial measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction either by transthoracic echocardiogram or by radionuclide angiocardiography, as done in patients receiving doxorubicin, may be a useful modality in monitoring patients planned for bevacizumab therapy via any route while the search for more sensitive and reliable predictors of eventual left ventricular dysfunction continues.In conclusion, bevacizumab causes reversible dose-dependent left ventricular dysfunction irrespective of the route of administration. It is prudent for clinicians to consider serial transthoracic echocardiogram and monitoring of systolic function to facilitate early detection of this medication side effect and dose adjustment. This is particularly important in patients at high risk of side effects from this class of drugs such as those with low body mass index, advanced age, preexisting or bevacizumab-induced hypertension, and other concurrent chemotherapies [11]. Further research on the pathogenesis of left ventricular dysfunction associated with bevacizumab and the creation of a registry for data synthesis is also needed.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Apical 4-chamber view of transthoracic echocardiogram showing global hypokinesis.

Coronary Artery Ectasia Presenting as a Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction in a Young Adult: Case Presentation and Literature Review
Department of Medicine, Saint Francis Medical Center, Trenton, NJ 08629, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Kareem Genena; rf.liamtoh@anenegkReceived 24 April 2018; Revised 23 July 2018; Accepted 31 July 2018; Published 26 August 2018Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2018 Kareem Genena et al.

Whereas coronary atherosclerosis accounts for about 50% of CAE, the remaining 50% are either congenital or secondary to a host of inflammatory and connective tissue disorders, with Kawasaki disease being a well-known association. Patients with CAE have worse outcomes than the general population regardless of the presence of associated atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. We report the case of a young male presenting with chest pain, a right bundle branch block on electrocardiography, an elevated troponin level, and a regional wall motion abnormality on echocardiography who is found to have diffuse coronary artery ectasia on coronary angiography and is managed medically with dual antiplatelet therapy.Coronary artery aneurysms, also known as coronary artery ectasia (CAE), are an uncommon cause of acute coronary syndromes. They are most often secondary to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease but could be congenital and could be the sequela of vasculitic coronary disorders.A 26-year-old African-American gentleman presents to the emergency department with pressure-like retrosternal chest pain that occurred one hour after he completed a workout. His pain subsided after ingestion of an antacid. He has no known medical history and takes no medications. He is a current smoker with a pack-year index of 22. He smokes marijuana but denies other illicit drug use. Both his father and grandfather had hypertension, diabetes, and peripheral arterial disease requiring limb amputation, but there was no known family history of coronary artery disease.EKG revealed a right bundle branch block with no ST segment or T wave changes indicating ischemia. Initial troponin level was elevated at 8 ng/ml (normal range: <0.03 ng/ml). The patient refused to be admitted for further evaluation and left the hospital against medical advice. He returned a week later, with no symptoms, only to complete the evaluation of his prior episode of chest pain. Echocardiography revealed akinesis in the basal and inferior walls with an ejection fraction of 50%. Coronary angiography revealed moderately to severely dilated aneurysms in the proximal segments of the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries without flow-limiting lesions (Figure 1).The patient had no recollection of any febrile childhood illness that would be consistent with childhood Kawasaki disease. He was discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy and a high-intensity statin, as well as metformin for a new diagnosis of prediabetes.Coronary aneurysms are defined by dilation of a segment of the coronary arteries that is >1.5 times the adjacent normal segment [1]. In one series of 3870 patients undergoing coronary angiography in Italy, the prevalence of CAE was 3.6% [2]. Other angiographic series have reported prevalence rates that varied widely, from 0.3% to 12% [3].The most common cause of CAE is atherosclerotic coronary disease. However, CAE could be congenital and could be secondary to vasculitic disorders affecting the coronaries such as Kawasaki disease, connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome, or infectious etiologies such as mycotic aneurysms. Coronary aneurysms could also be iatrogenic, after coronary intervention. Atherosclerotic and congenital coronary aneurysms account for 70–80% of all CAE [3].Reports of the contribution of the traditional risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease to the formation of coronary aneurysms have varied. In one study of 32,372 patients undergoing coronary angiography in the United States, aneurysmal patients presented similar frequencies of hypertension (61% versus 55%, ) and a smoking history (47% versus 41%, ) as did controls. Moreover, patients with aneurysms were less likely to be diabetic (18% versus 26%, ) and/or current smokers (13% versus 19%, ). Hyperlipidemia (55% versus 44%, ) and male gender (83% versus 60%, ) were the only traditional risk factors that were identified in a higher frequency in aneurysmal patients in this study [4]. This only points to the fact that CAE and atherosclerotic CAD share common risk factors and does not imply that smoking or hypertension is not a risk factor for CAE. It can be seen in the latter study that 61% and 47% of patients with CAE had hypertension and a smoking history, respectively. Smoking is a known risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysms. Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms have an odds ratio of 2.4 of being smokers according to a meta-analysis of 14 cross-sectional studies [5].Myocardial infarction in patients with CAE could occur due to associated atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and could occur due to aneurysm thrombosis secondary to stagnant nonlaminar flow that is not related to plaque rupture.Medical therapy for CAE includes antiplatelet agents and guideline-directed medical therapy for associated cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Anticoagulation is suggested for larger caliber aneurysms on the premise of an increased risk of aneurysm thrombosis. Percutaneous intervention is challenging due to large vessel caliber, thrombus burden within the aneurysm, and the potential need for a covered stent. When thrombus is identified within the aneurysm, thrombus aspiration can be attempted. In cases where residual thrombus remains in the artery despite aspiration, some authors advocate for triple antithrombotic therapy, that is, dual antiplatelet therapy and an anticoagulant. Low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) has been used by some authors [6]. Solitary bypass grafting is suggested as the intervention of choice for nongiant aneurysms by some authors [7]. Other surgical options include aneurysm ligation, resection, or marsupialization with interposition grafting [3, 7].The authors disclose no conflict of interest.
His-Bundle Pacing in a Patient with Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation-Induced Left Bundle Branch Block
University Hospital Geelong, Barwon Health, PO Box 281, Geelong, VIC 3220, AustraliaCorrespondence should be addressed to Jonathan Sen; moc.nesnahtanoj@hcraeserReceived 13 June 2018; Revised 24 July 2018; Accepted 5 August 2018; Published 23 August 2018Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2018 Jonathan Sen et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective intervention for severe aortic stenosis in patients at intermediate or high surgical risk, but damage to the native conduction system such as left bundle branch block (LBBB) may offset its benefits. New onset LBBB is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. His-bundle pacing (HBP) may be useful to treat TAVI-induced LBBB but has yet to be reported. We present the case of a 76-year-old man with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis treated with TAVI. His preoperative electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a narrow QRS complex. Insertion of a CoreValve Evolut R transcatheter aortic valve was uneventful apart from the development of LBBB with a long PR interval. A dual-lead DDD pacemaker was implanted via the left cephalic vein on the following day. HV was mildly prolonged at 60 ms. Capture of the proximal His restored AV synchrony without correction of LBBB. Repositioning of the lead with capture of the left bundle branch enabled complete ventricular resynchronisation with a single lead. Our case demonstrates that LBBB in the setting of TAVI may be corrected by HBP.Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective treatment for severe aortic stenosis in patients at intermediate or high surgical risk [1, 2]. However, damage to the native conduction system including complete atrioventricular (AV) block (6–25%) and new left bundle branch block (LBBB) (4–65%) may occur and offset the benefit of the intervention [3–5]. New-onset LBBB causes a delay in depolarisation of the left ventricle and predicts higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and high rates of pacemaker implantation [2, 6].Pacing at the distal His bundle may correct LBBB. Case reports support the concept of longitudinal dissociation in the His bundle [7], that is, fibres within the His bundle are predestined for the left or right bundle branch. Pacing at the His bundle may capture fibres of a bundle branch distal to the site of intra-Hisian block [6]. However, to our knowledge, the correction of TAVI-induced LBBB via HBP has not been reported [7, 8]. This is likely due to more distal block and the relative inaccessibility of the left bundle branch conduction fibres to the pacing lead helix. Here, we describe HBP as a therapeutic intervention for patients with TAVI-induced LBBB.A 76-year-old man was electively admitted for intervention and management of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis resulting in worsening New York Heart Association Class III cardiac failure. His medical history included stage III chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prior coronary artery bypass grafting. Coronary angiography demonstrated a patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and a saphenous vein graft to the dominant distal left circumflex artery with a severe stenosis distal to the surgical anastomosis.Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and showed a thickened and calcified aortic valve with reduced cusp excursion, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal left ventricular cavity size, and systolic function. The left atrium was severely dilated. Left ventricular ejection fraction was above 55%. Valve area was estimated at 0.8 cm2, with a measured mean gradient of 44 mmHg.A cardiac conference was held to discuss intervention for his severe aortic stenosis. TAVI was chosen in preference to a redo sternotomy in the setting of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 5.8% (intermediate risk cardiac surgery), stable coronary artery disease, and in accordance with the patient’s preference.The preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with a narrow QRS complex (Figure 1(a)). Using a right femoral approach, a CoreValve Evolut R 29 mm (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) transcatheter aortic valve was deployed after balloon aortic valvuloplasty with an 18 mm Cristal balloon. TAVI was uneventful. Postdilatation was performed using a 23 mm Cristal balloon due to moderate paravalvular aortic regurgitation around the left coronary cusp seen on a postprocedure transoesophageal echocardiogram. At the time of TAVI, the patient developed LBBB (average QRS duration of 180 ms) with a prolonged PR interval of 240 ms (Figure 1(b)). Within the first 24 hours post-TAVI, he also had episodes of high-grade AV block.A dual-lead Boston Scientific Accolade™ Extended Life DR Pacemaker was implanted via the left cephalic vein (Figure 2). The HV interval was mildly prolonged at 60 ms. Proximal His capture (selective) threshold was less than 1 V without recruitment of the left bundle branch; RV myocardial capture threshold was 1.5 V at 1 ms; correction of LBBB—due to the presumed capture of distal His bundle and recruitment of the left bundle branch—occurred at 4.5-5 V at 1 ms. A Medtronic 5076 lead was then placed in the right atrial appendage with a threshold less than 1 V. The device was programmed DDD 50. The paced QRS duration on 12 lead ECG was 125 ms consistent with nonselective HBP (para-Hisian morphology) (Figure 1(c)). At 1 month, 12 lead electrocardiogram tracing showed continued correction of LBBB at 5 V @ 1 ms.TAVI is an increasingly common intervention for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis at intermediate or high risk with standard surgery. The multinational randomized Surgical Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation trial (SURTAVI) demonstrated that TAVI was noninferior to surgical replacement based on a composite of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 2 years; however, TAVI had markedly higher rates of pacemaker implantation [9].The risk of heart block and the need for permanent pacing is higher with CoreValve (25%) than other TAVI models [10, 11]. The CoreValve’s self-expanding frame and deeper implantation into the left ventricular outflow tract may result in mechanical injury of the His bundle and/or left bundle branch accounting for this higher risk [11].LBBB is the most common TAVI-induced conduction abnormality reported in 29–65% of patients implanted with CoreValve [11, 12]. LBBB causes rhythmic and haemodynamic complications, is associated with worse outcomes, and can lead to heart failure [13]. The effect of new-onset LBBB on mortality is uncertain, but some studies found a significantly higher mortality rate in patients who develop LBBB post-TAVI [11, 14]. Even though the incidence of new-onset LBBB is higher in patients implanted with CoreValve compared to Edwards SAPIEN valve, no difference in mortality was observed [14].There is no published guideline on the management of LBBB post-TAVI. In our case, we elected to place a pacemaker due to the presence of a long PR interval, new-onset LBBB, and an expanding valve. The His bundle contains fibres predestined to form the right and left bundle branches, a theory confirmed by correction of bundle branch block by pacing at the His bundle presumably due to the recruitment of fibres distal to the site of block [15]. In our case, these fibres were found by mapping for the His bundle potential, with small movements of the lead tip until a suitable pacing site where correction of the underlying LBBB was achieved, albeit at high pacing output.A standard dual-chamber device would resynchronise the atrial and ventricular chambers, but leave the ventricular chambers dyssynchronous. We placed a dual-chamber His bundle device to allow resynchronisation of all chambers. In the largest series to date of HBP in patients with heart block postprosthetic valve replacement, Sharma and colleagues included four patients post-TAVI—all Edward SAPIEN valves: in two cases, HBP was unsuccessful and a standard right ventricular lead was placed—in the remaining two patients, HBP was employed successfully to correct RBBB in one case and to retain a narrow QRS complex in the other [8]. In our case, we were able to obtain selective HBP at a low threshold, but true correction of LBBB—presumably due to more distal disease—was only possible at higher output.The tools for HBP are rudimentary. The Medtronic SelectSecure lead has an exposed helix screw with no inner lumen and must be delivered through a fixed sheath (Medtronic 315His) delivered through a 7 French introducer sheath, or a deflectable sheath (Medtronic SelectSite C304) delivered through a 9Fr introducer sheath. Implantation is therefore limited by anatomy. It may be that improved delivery tools allow more precise placement of the lead with lower subsequent thresholds. To some extent, the higher output required in our case may be mitigated through device programming by increased pulse width, pacing with output marginally (0.5-1 V) above the left bundle branch threshold, and the use of a pacemaker with an extended-life battery.Our case demonstrates that LBBB in the setting of TAVI may be corrected by pacing at the His bundle. To our knowledge, this is the first report of HBP with a self-expanding valve and the first report for left bundle branch recruitment in this setting. HBP allows complete AV and ventricular resynchronisation with two leads. Longer-term follow-up will be needed to determine the chronic threshold of LBBB correction.Patient informed consent for publication of this case report was obtained in accordance with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ (ICMJE) recommendations and publication ethics guideline set out by the Committee on Publication Ethics.All three authors (Jonathan Sen, Michael Mok, and Mark Perrin) declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.All three authors (Jonathan Sen, Michael Mok, and Mark Perrin) made significant contributions to the manuscript, which included a review of patient charts, data collection, and interpretation.

Sick Sinus Syndrome and Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy
1Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University/Detroit Medical Center, Detroit, MI, USA2Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University/Detroit Medical Center, Detroit, MI, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Ahmed S. Yassin; ude.enyaw@0060mgReceived 4 April 2018; Revised 8 June 2018; Accepted 19 July 2018; Published 19 August 2018Academic Editor: Gianluca Di BellaCopyright © 2018 Ahmed S. Yassin et al.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, and bradyarrhythmias. However, sinus node dysfunction is relatively infrequent in the setting of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Case Report. We are reporting a case of a 73-year-old woman with a history of asymptomatic sinus bradycardia who developed sick sinus syndrome complicated by takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Conclusion. Acute symptomatic sick sinus syndrome in patients with preexisting silent sinus node dysfunction can trigger takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Understanding precipitating factors of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and identifying the patients at risk of life-threatening arrhythmia can help in refining risk stratification and therapy planning. Patients with sick sinus syndrome complicated by takotsubo cardiomyopathy may benefit from pacemaker implantation. However, evaluation on a case-by-case basis is mandatory.First described in Japan by Dote et al. in 1990, takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) became increasingly reported as a form of reversible focal myocardial hypokinesis following significant psychological or physical stress [1, 2]. Arrhythmias are common in patients with TC including atrial fibrillation (5–15% of the cases) and ventricular arrhythmias (4–9% of the cases) [2]. However, sinus node dysfunction (SND) is relatively infrequent in the setting of TC (1.3% of the cases) [3]. We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman with a history of asymptomatic sinus bradycardia who developed sick sinus syndrome (SSS) complicated by takotsubo cardiomyopathy.We present the case of a 73-year-old woman with a history of asymptomatic sinus bradycardia that presented to our facility with a chief complaint of acute chest pain. She was found to have elevated troponin I of 0.3 ng/ml (normal < 0.057). Chest X-ray was normal. Laboratory workup revealed normal complete blood count, bleeding profile, basic metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and random blood glucose. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was suggestive of junctional escape rhythm with a heart rate (HR) of 37 beats/minute (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed reduced left ventricular function (ejection fraction (EF) of 30%), with apical ballooning suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy versus acute coronary syndrome (Figure 2). Left ventriculogram also showed ventricular ballooning suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Figure 3). Cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries. Thus, she was diagnosed with classical TC. Due to her symptomatic bradycardia, a temporary pacing wire was placed. Her diagnosis was suggestive of sick sinus syndrome as she had occasional P waves that were fine (Figure 4). Overnight, she went into an atrial flutter with a variable block (Figure 5). Although, no rate control agent was started, the HR was 83 beats/minute (Figure 5). Her atrial flutter continued over the next 24 hours. A dual-chamber pacemaker was recommended and placed without complications by the electrophysiology team. Her rhythm on discharge was rate-controlled atrial flutter. She was discharged home on a beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and anticoagulation. Her TTE findings were resolved on a follow-up visit two weeks later. However, pacemaker interrogation revealed frequent episodes of paroxysmal rate-controlled atrial fibrillation alternating with bradycardia requiring cardiac pacing. The patient is still under regular follow-up in the cardiology clinic.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by reversible regional dyskinesia of the ventricular myocardium typically extending beyond a single coronary vascular bed [2]. TC can mimic acute heart failure or acute myocardial infarction in clinical presentation and be usually but not always triggered by medically or emotionally stressful events [2, 4]. The absence of significant coronary stenosis is a prerequisite for the diagnosis on almost all accepted diagnostic criteria [2, 4]. Arrhythmia is a common complication in patients with TC [2]. Also, TC can evolve after discrete episodes of arrhythmia [3]. However, SND in the setting of TC is relatively infrequent. In a review by Syed et al., new SND was observed in 11 of 816 TC patients (1.3%) [3]. Tsuchihashi et al. in a case series of 88 patients with TC reported sinus bradycardia in nine patients [5]. Dib et al. reported sinus pauses (up to 7.4 seconds) in one patient who eventually developed asystole mandating temporary pacemaker and inotropic support [6]. Hertting et al. reported one patient with symptomatic SSS requiring permanent pacemaker implantation [7]. Also, a case report by Kim described symptomatic SSS during the index episode requiring permanent pacemaker implantation [8]. However, in the previously reported cases, it is unclear whether TC is the cause or effect of SND. Theoretically, TC can cause SND through several mechanisms [3, 9]. Adrenergic compensative activation following bradycardia can induce transient myocardial dysfunction [10]. Ueyama et al. reported left ventriculography normalization in emotionally stressed rats with induced reversible LV apical ballooning, by pretreatment with adrenal receptor blockade [11, 12]. In time, catecholamine stress in TC can lead to a secondary increase in vagal tone with subsequent SND [3], and catecholamine-mediated myocardial stunning was considered crucial in the pathogenesis of TC. Therefore, reflex sympathetic stimulation to counteract severe SND may trigger TC. Age-related sinus node degeneration may also exacerbate that effect.However, our patient had preexisting evidence of SND. She was seen in the cardiology outpatient clinic two months prior to admission for asymptomatic bradycardia. She was not on any negative chronotropic medication. Her EKG showed sinus bradycardia with no PR prolongation or conduction block. A 48 hr Holter monitor showed slow heart rate (HR) during sleep (30–40 beats/min) with an early morning pause of 3.5 seconds and an average HR of 61 beats/min. TTE showed EF 55–60%, with no regional wall motion abnormality. Thus, no intervention was necessary at that time. On admission emotional stress, medical stress and the intake of negative chronotropic drugs were ruled out during her focused history and examination. Therefore, reflex catecholamine surge to counteract bradycardia may have set the scene for TC evolution in this patient making SSS the most plausible trigger. Also, after the resolution of TC, our patient had episodes of bradycardia requiring cardiac pacing. Thus, TC is unlikely to be the cause of her SSS.Pacemaker implantation was indicated in our patient due to the documented symptomatic bradycardia [13]. Dual-chamber pacemaker is recommended over single-chamber atrial pacing for all patients with sick sinus syndrome [14]. Also, in our patient, a concomitant atrioventricular nodal disease was expected. Furthermore, cardiac pacing allows adequate rate control (if needed) given that tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome persisted after TC resolution [13]. The patient also had prolongation of the QT interval during the acute phase of TC, which lowers her threshold for the development of torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation [2]. In addition, SND in patients with TC with QT prolongation can lead to significant rate variation and consequently higher risk torsades de pointes [3]. Thus, cardiac pacing may potentially reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.(i)Acute symptomatic sick sinus syndrome in patients with preexisting silent sinus node dysfunction can trigger takotsubo cardiomyopathy.(ii)Understanding precipitating factors of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and identifying the patients at risk of life-threatening arrhythmia can help in refining risk stratification and therapy planning.(iii)Patients with sick sinus syndrome complicated by takotsubo cardiomyopathy may benefit from pacemaker implantation. However, evaluation on a case-by-case basis is mandatory.None of the authors have any conflicts of interest to declare.
A Long-Term Survivor with Tetralogy of Fallot Treated Only with the Classical Blalock-Taussig Shunt
1Department of Cardiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan2Department of Cardiology, Hitachi General Hospital, Ibaraki, Japan3Department of Pediatrics, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Tomoko Ishizu; pj.ca.abukust.dm@ocomotReceived 22 April 2018; Revised 21 July 2018; Accepted 1 August 2018; Published 19 August 2018Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2018 Yu Yamada et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The prognosis of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) treated only with Blalock-Taussig shunt (BTS) operation is unclear. A woman with TOF underwent classic BTS operation at 10 years of age. Despite no medication, she delivered two children and worked without apparent heart failure. At 72 years of age, she complained of dyspnea on exertion and leg edema. The cardiac angiogram revealed a well-patent BTS and severely stenotic right ventricular outflow tract. Right heart catheterization showed adequately maintained pulmonary blood flow with slight pulmonary arterial hypertension. Her unexpected yet favorable outcome reaffirms the importance of structural and functional self-adaptation even with cyanosis. If she had undergone a valve-sparing corrective surgery in adolescence, much better quality of life and outcome could have been expected.Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cause of cyanotic congenital heart disease, and Blalock-Taussig shunt (BTS) operation is considered the first-step management for maintaining pulmonary blood flow in TOF patients. Complete transventricular repair of TOF is the standard surgical treatment that should be performed in infancy or early childhood [1]. Long-term survival has improved because it is associated with lower operative mortality [2, 3]. However, the prognosis of patients with TOF treated by only palliative operation remains unclear. We describe a patient with TOF treated by classic BTS operation who lived a productive life without obvious symptoms in the long term.A woman with TOF underwent left classic BTS operation by the late cardiac surgeon Professor Shigeru Sakakibara at the Tokyo Women’s Medical College, Tokyo, Japan, in the 1950s when she was 10 years old. She stopped visiting the hospital a few years postoperatively because she did not have difficulty performing daily activities. Subsequently, she got married at 25 years of age and gave birth to two children at 29 years of age without special gynecological care at a local hospital. She kept working on a production line while raising her children without experiencing symptoms of heart failure.At 70 years of age, she was found to have a low oxygen saturation during a health examination program, but she did not seek hospital care. She developed dyspnea and leg edema when she was 72 years old, and then diuretic was started for a diagnosis of heart failure at a local clinic. When she was referred to our hospital for further evaluation, her symptoms of heart failure were comparable with the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III. Her oxygen saturation was 88% on room air at rest. Her heart examination revealed a continuous murmur (Levine III/VI) and systolic ejection murmur (IV/VI) in the second right sternal border. Laboratory data showed the following values (reference ranges): hemoglobin level 15.7 g/dl, hematocrit 44.5%, platelet count 19.7 × 104/μl, prothrombin time 11.4 seconds, 98.5%, D-dimer level 1.2 μg/dl (<1.0 μg/dl), creatinine level 1.35 mg/dl (0.4–0.8 mg/dl), and serum brain-type natriuretic peptide level 210 pg/ml (<18.4 pg/ml). A chest radiograph revealed a cardiothoracic ratio of 66%, right-sided aortic arch, and prominently dilated PA without pulmonary congestion (Figure 1(a)). The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a prolonged PR interval and ST-T segment abnormalities (Figure 1(b)). The echocardiogram showed a large ventricular septal defect with a bidirectional, mainly left-to-right shunt, overriding the aorta, right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, and a stenotic RV outflow tract with a peak velocity of 4.9 m/s (Figure 2). Left ventricular (LV) diastolic indices of echocardiogram were as follows: peak E velocity 80 cm/s, E/A 0.72, septal E velocity 4.1 cm/s, lateral E velocity 3.5 cm/s, and average E/E 21. Abnormal relaxation pattern of transmitral flow, low E velocity, and high E/E suggested the existence of LV diastolic dysfunction. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging scan showed reduced RV ejection fraction (EF) of 28% and preserved LVEF of 60% with a LV end-diastolic volume index of 103 ml/m2 (Figures 2(e) and 2(f)). There was no abnormality in the pulmonary valve (PV), and the diameter of the PV annulus was 24 mm. The catheter angiogram revealed a patent BTS and severe stenosis at the ostium of the left PA (Figure 3). Right heart catheterization showed a normal PA wedge pressure (systolic/diastolic/mean pressure: 15/9/8 mmHg), mildly elevated PA pressure (systolic/diastolic/mean pressure: 35/20/30 mmHg), elevated RV systolic and end-diastolic pressure (135/20 mmHg), mean right atrial pressure (11 mmHg), and systolic and end-diastolic LV pressure (149/23 mmHg). The pressure gradient between the PA and right ventricle was 117 mmHg. Cardiac output calculated by the Fick principle was 2.9 l/min, and pulmonary vascular resistance index was 5.95 Wood units⋅m2. The brain’s magnetic resonance imaging scan showed no significant abnormalities. She started to take diuretics and home oxygen inspiration therapies; her heart failure symptom improved to NYHA II. Based on the clinical and hemodynamic assessments and her age, we decided not to perform radical operation.The patient was fortunate to have a patent right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) that allowed her to live for ten years without surgery. The combination of the classic BTS at age 10 and the patent RVOT provided enough pulmonary blood flow to allow her to survive into her seventies. The use of the left classic BTS in the setting of a right aortic arch created a source of pulmonary blood flow that could grow along with her. Also, the RVOT must have grown along with her somatic growth [4].Previous reports in PubMed of unoperated TOF surviving over 70 years old are shown in Table 1 [5–15]. There are rarely reported studies on long-term outcome about patients with TOF treated by only palliative operation.Prolonged survival of patients with uncorrected TOF is often associated with a well-developed left ventricle, initially mild pulmonary stenosis, or well-maintained pulmonary blood flow by such as systemic to pulmonary collaterals or persistent patent ductus arteriosus. Furthermore, in our case, there was no history of significant organ dysfunction due to hypoxia, and no major complication of adult patients with uncorrected TOF such as brain abscess or infective endocarditis. Compared to previous reports (Table 1), it is an important thing that she gave birth to two children without significant symptoms of heart failure. In the case reported by Sousa et al. [15], the patient gave birth to one child without complications; however, her subpulmonary stenosis was very mild (maximum gradient of 31 mmHg) and her pulmonary blood flow was well maintained (). In our case, appropriately adjusted pulmonary blood flow by BTS might enable her to give birth to two children safely.This patient had favorable anatomy that allowed her to live for a long time, but there was evidence of biventricular dysfunction accompanied with elevated right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. It might be caused by long-term pressure overload and cyanotic state. Although the diameter of the PV annulus was measured in her seventies, the size of 24 mm must have been acceptable for valve-sparing corrective surgery [16–18]. If she had undergone a valve-sparing corrective surgery in adolescence, much better quality of life and outcome could have been expected.This case shows that classical BTS has a potential of long-term patency with good functional capacity. Appropriately adjusted pulmonary blood flow by BTS may cause long-term survival and a productive life in patients with TOF.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Streptococcus pyogenes Pericarditis with Resultant Pulmonary Trunk Compression Secondary to Mycotic Pseudoaneurysm
Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USACorrespondence should be addressed to D. Gantt; gro.htlaehwsb@ttnag.divadReceived 7 April 2018; Accepted 23 June 2018; Published 16 August 2018Academic Editor: Kuan-Rau ChiouCopyright © 2018 E. Fry et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Purulent pericarditis is a rare disease in the era of antibiotics, with Streptococcus pyogenes being a possible, though uncommon etiology. Even more uncommon are mycotic aneurysms secondary to group A strep purulent pericarditis and bacteremia. We report a case of an 18-year-old female with a history of strep pharyngitis develop Streptococcus pyogenes purulent pericarditis with subsequent ventricular fibrillation (VF). Following initial stabilization, she ultimately developed a 4.8 cm mycotic aneurysm of the ascending aorta, with resultant compression of the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary arteries.Purulent pericarditis is a rare but rapidly progressing and in some cases deadly event. Rapid detection via imaging and high clinical suspicion are paramount. Purulent pericarditis can, in limited cases, complicate clinical course by instigating mycotic pseudoaneurysm formation in the aorta. Proper imaging and prompt treatment with antibiotic therapy and either endovascular or open surgical repair are vital. We present a case of group A strep purulent pericarditis that resulted in formation of a mycotic pseudoaneurysm in an otherwise healthy 18-year-old female. She underwent subsequent urgent surgical repair with complete recovery. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of purulent pericarditis complicated by mycotic pseudoaneurysm.An 18-year-old female with an allergy to penicillin and a past medical history of migraines presented to the emergency department with pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea on exertion. Three months prior she had an upper respiratory infection. Her initial workup was unrevealing, including negative troponin and normal complete blood count. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) chest had no significant findings. She was diagnosed with atypical chest pain and discharged home.She returned three days later with worsening chest pain. ECG (Figure 1(a)) was significant for sinus tachycardia, PR depressions, and diffuse ST elevations, consistent with pericarditis. Significant findings at that time included a Troponin-I of 0.28 ng/ml and white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.2 (16,200). Shortly after admission, she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension and tachycardia in the 150 s. Echocardiography demonstrated a moderate pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade. Pericardiocentesis yielded 300 ml of serous fluid and established hemodynamic stability. She was initiated on empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and meropenem. Later that same day, she underwent emergent intubation and vasopressor support after two separate episodes of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless electrical activity, requiring multiple rounds of advanced cardiac life support. After stabilization, fluid aspiration from the pericardial drain revealed 130 ml of purulent fluid. Her final pericardial fluid cultures and blood cultures grew Streptococcus pyogenes. Antibiotic coverage was weaned to intravenous cefazolin monotherapy. She continued to drain 240–360 milliliters of purulent pericardial fluid daily and was on norepinephrine for pressure support. Post resuscitation, she developed acute renal failure that required intermittent renal replacement therapy secondary to acute tubular necrosis. Antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin and cefepime after the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to multifocal pneumonia. She was gradually weaned from the ventilator and subsequently extubated. The remaining hospital course was uneventful, and she was discharged home on oral levofloxacin for completion of her antibiotic course.The patient returned to the ED several days later with shortness of breath and worsening back pain that radiated to her chest. The ECG (Figure 1(b)) at that time was significant for sinus tachycardia and an S1Q3T3 phenomenon. She was admitted for severe sepsis and started on ceftriaxone for concern of recurrent bacteremia. Repeat transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated right ventricular strain and what appeared to be a near to total occlusion of her pulmonary trunk (Figure 2). Computed tomography (CT) angiography was significant for a 4.8 cm small-necked pseudoaneurysm arising off the anterolateral aspect of the aorta and was found to be compressing the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery (Figure 3).Our patient was again transferred to the ICU. A subsequent CT chest with contrast demonstrated pseudoaneurysm expansion to 5.3 cm. Emergent cardiothoracic surgery with circulatory arrest was performed. The operation revealed a 2 cm × 1 cm wall defect in the distal ascending aorta, extending into the arch of the aorta. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed right ventricular remodeling resulting in a severely strained D-shaped ventricle and severely dilated RVOT of 4 cm (Figure 4). Additionally, there was significant clot burden in the anterior mediastinum encasing the ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery. A CorMatrix patch was used to close the defect, and a specimen of the anterior mediastinal mass was sent for pathological analysis, confirming our diagnosis of a mycotic pseudoaneurysm. The patient tolerated the surgical procedure well and did not require additional operations during her inpatient hospital recovery.Purulent pericardial effusions are a relatively uncommon occurrence, particularly in the post antibiotic era. A retrospective study in Spain, done between 1972 and 1991, indicated an incidence of 33 in a population of 593,600 [1]. It is most often caused by gram positive cocci (40–45%) with Staphylococcus aureus comprising the majority of cases. Other commonly reported organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, viridans streptococci, and anaerobic bacteria [2, 3]. There is a scarcity of reported group A streptococcal purulent pericardial effusions in current publications. Literature review yielded 11 previously reported cases of which only one formed a mycotic pseudoaneurysm [4]. Patients’ age ranged from 4 months to 14 years old [4–12]. Dissemination of the bacteria to the pericardium typically occurs via 4 major mechanisms: (1) direct pulmonary extension such as streptococcal pneumonia/pharyngitis infection 20–25%; (2) hematogenous spread 22–29%; (3) perforating injury or surgery 24–29%; and (4) myocardial abscess and/or endocarditis in 14–22% [2, 3]. Certain factors can predispose towards their occurrence, such as transplant recipients, immunocompromised state, or chronic comorbidities. Common complications from purulent pericarditis can include constrictive pericardial disease due to thickening and scarring of the pericardium or pericardial empyema [13]. Despite treatment, up to 40% of patients die from tamponade, constriction, or toxicity [14]. Previously described successful treatments include a 2-to-4-week duration of intravenous antibiotic monotherapy with β-lactam agents or combination therapy with a β-lactam and aminoglycoside [7].Mycotic pseudoaneuryms are rarely described following purulent pericardial effusions and only comprise a small minority of all aneurysms (0.7%) [15]. Hematogenous seeding of a damaged atherosclerotic wall is the most frequently described pathogenesis for infected aortic aneurysms [16], with staphylococcal and salmonella spp. being the most common [17]. Other predisposing factors include impaired immunity, arterial injury, or preexisting aneurysm [15, 18, 19]. Foroulis et al. and Sorensen et al. previously describe aortic aneurysms involving pulmonary artery compression, though neither was mycotic in origin [20, 21]. Management of pseudoaneurysm typically consists of antibiotic therapy and either endovascular or open repair. An endovascular approach is preferred in high-risk patient, patients with significant comorbidities, or as a bridge to future surgical repair [19, 22]. Inherently, endovascular repair carries an increased risk of secondary infections and graft failure. Open surgical repair has been shown to have an initial higher mortality rate compared with endovascular repair but displays improved long-term bacterial clearance and mortality benefit [19, 22].Purulent pericarditis is a rare and serious condition with a high chance of complications and mortality. We describe a rare case of group A streptococcal purulent pericarditis with multiple complications, including mycotic pseudoaneurysm formation and resultant compression on the pulmonary vasculature. While unusual, mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysms are a reported complication following purulent pericardial infection. Appropriate and early antibiotic therapy was key in our patient’s recovery as well as swift pseudoaneurysm identification and surgical intervention.This case was previously presented at the American College of Cardiology 2018 in the clinical decision-making section of poster presentations.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
A Rare Case of Spontaneous Cardiac Tamponade Induced by Concomitant Use of Rivaroxaban and Amiodarone
1Reading Hospital, Tower Health System, Reading, PA, USA2Benenden Hospitals Trust, Kent, UKCorrespondence should be addressed to Oreoluwa Oladiran; gro.htlaehrewot@naridalo.awuloeroReceived 14 June 2018; Accepted 27 July 2018; Published 12 August 2018Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2018 Oreoluwa Oladiran et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) approved as an important alternative to warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. We report the case of an 87-year-old man with past medical history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban and recently started amiodarone for pulseless ventricular tachycardia who presented to our hospital with intermittent chest pain and was diagnosed with spontaneous hemopericardium causing cardiac tamponade. The culprit drugs were discontinued, and the patient was treated with emergent pericardiocentesis. Both rivaroxaban and amiodarone are substrates for the CYP3A4 hepatic pathway, and concomitant use can result in increased plasma rivaroxaban levels causing an increased propensity to bleeding. While most physicians are cognizant of the need for renal dosing of rivaroxaban, this article aims to increase awareness of its interactions with drugs that are also metabolized through the same hepatic CYP450 pathway.Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [1]. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent indicated for the prevention of recurrent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias [2]. All anticoagulants including rivaroxaban are associated with increased risk of bleeding. The risk of bleeding with rivaroxaban can be accentuated by the concomitant use of medications such as amiodarone [3] which compete for metabolism via the CYP3A4 hepatic pathway [4]. The incidence of spontaneous hemopericardium due to rivaroxaban is unknown, likely due to its rarity as only few cases have been documented so far [5–7]. However, with increasing use of this medication, rare side effects like this will be encountered more often. Clinicians must be aware of this rare catastrophic possibility that could result from the lethal combination of rivaroxaban and amiodarone. We suggest that rivaroxaban package insert should include more information on medications considered to be inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein system.An 87-year-old male with medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on 20 mg of rivaroxaban daily, recent pulseless ventricular tachycardia with implantable cardiac defibrillator in situ, and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 35%) presented to the emergency room (ER) with intermittent chest pain and light headedness of 2 days duration. Chest pain was exertional, left sided, and pleuritic. He also reported shortness of breath but denied cough, fever, or any other infectious. Of note, he was commenced on 200 mg amiodarone daily four months prior to presentation following an episode of syncope due to pulseless ventricular tachycardia.Initial vital signs showed blood pressure of 89/60 mmHg with pulse rate of 59/min, temperature of 98.2°F, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min with normal oxygen saturation of 100% on ambient air. On physical examination, he was in no acute distress and was alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Jugular venous distention was noted on neck examination. Heart sounds were muffled, but lung fields were clear to auscultation. Peripheral pulses were also weak but palpable.His EKG on arrival to the emergency room showed new widespread ST segment elevation (Figure 1). His troponin was trended and remained <0.03 ng/mL (normal <0.05 ng/mL). Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL (normal 14–17.5 g/dL), white blood cell count of 11.7/microliter (normal 4.8–10.8/microliter), and normal platelet count of 211/microliter (normal 130–400/microliter). Basic metabolic panel revealed creatinine of 3.4 mg/dL from baseline of <0.8 mg/dL (normal 0.6–1.3 mg/dL) with BUN of 58 mg/dL (normal 7–25 mg/dL). His liver function test showed AST of 90 U/L (normal 13–39 U/L), ALT of 126 U/L (normal 7–52 U/L), and total bilirubin of 1.2 mg/dL (0.3–1.0 mg/dL). INR was also elevated at 2.2 (normal 0.9–1.1) with prothrombin time of 24.7 seconds (normal 12.3–14.6 seconds). Initial lactate was also elevated at 3.2 meq/L (normal 0.6–1.4 meq/L).Chest X-ray revealed enlargement of the cardiomedistinal silhouette. CT chest revealed new moderate-sized pericardial effusion (Figure 2).Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed large circumferential pericardial effusion and evidence for tamponade physiology with multichamber collapse and significant respirophasic variation to the mitral inflow pattern (Figure 3). Please see Supplementary Material (available here).Given the patient’s history of intermittent chest pain and presence of ST segment elevation on EKG, our initial suspicion was an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. However, at the time of evaluation by the cardiologist, the patient had no chest pain and serial troponin levels remained normal. Notably, patient had coronary angiography done 9 months prior to index presentation revealed minimal plaquing of the coronary arteries. We now know that the hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distention were part of the Beck’s triad of cardiac tamponade. The lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury, and elevated liver enzymes were likely the result of tissue hypoperfusion from hypotension while the leucocytosis was likely reactive.Based on the initial finding of ST segment elevation on EKG, he received a loading dose of 324 mg of ASA by EMS. Amiodarone was discontinued due to deranged liver and renal functions. We also held his rivaroxaban due to abnormal clotting profile and finding of hemopericardium on imaging studies. He had urgent pericardiocentesis in the catheterization laboratory with initial drainage of 825 mLs of sanguinous fluid, and postprocedural TTE showed evidence of resolution of tamponade. The pericardiocentesis catheter was left in place to drain any residual collections, and patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. He had daily TTE at the bedside, and his pericardial drainage volume progressively reduced from 160 cc on day 1 to 100 cc on day 2 to 80 cc on day 3 postpericardiocentesis when the drain was removed. Pericardial fluid analysis was negative for organisms or malignancy.Our patient experienced significant improvement of his symptoms following pericardiocentesis. His blood pressure normalized, and IV dopamine was discontinued immediately after pericardiocentesis. His renal function also improved significantly evidenced by a reduction in creatinine to normal at the time of discharge. He went home 5 days after admission and was instructed to stop his amiodarone and rivaroxaban in the mean time until his office appointment with his cardiologist.Based on the Naranjo causality assessment scale [8], there is probable relationship between our patient’s spontaneous hemopericardium and rivaroxaban use.Serious bleeding events have been reported with rivaroxaban, mainly intracranial and gastrointestinal [9], but only a few case reports of nontraumatic hemopericardium exist.Altered hepatic metabolism resulting from coadministration with amiodarone and transient renal impairment synergistically resulted in supratherapeutic serum levels of rivaroxaban in our patient resulting in nontraumatic hemopericardium and eventual cardiac tamponade.Elimination of rivaroxaban occurs through a dual pathway—hepatic metabolism occurs via the CYP450 pathway (mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2J2) while renal excretion via P-glycoprotein-mediated secretion [4]. Amiodarone and its main metabolite N-desethylamiodarone (NDEA) inhibit CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein resulting in supratherapeutic concentrations of rivaroxaban when used simultaneously.When used for stroke prophylaxis in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban using the cockroft-gault formula recommend that for creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL/minute as was the case in our patient prior to this admission, a standard dose of 20 mg once daily is adequate. However, for CrCl between 15 and 50 mL/minute, a dose adjustment to 15 mg once daily may be considered. Most clinicians recommend discontinuing rivaroxaban in acute kidney injury or CrCl less than 15 mL/minute [9]. No guidelines exist for dose adjustment when used with other medications undergoing CYP450 metabolism.Andexanet alfa, a recombinant modified human factor Xa protein, is an antidote recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [10] for patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban when reversal of anticoagulation is needed for life-threatening bleeding [11].However, there are neither routinely available laboratory tests to measure the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban nor consensus guidelines on the use of prothrombin complex concentrates, recombinant factor VIIa, and the newly approved reversal agents in patients on direct oral anticoagulants.This article aims to alert clinicians to this rare but increasingly reported side effect of rivaroxaban. A high index of suspicion is needed for recognition and diagnosis of spontaneous hemopericardium. Caution should be observed especially in elderly patients with declining renal function and increased likelihood of polypharmacy. With increasing use of rivaroxaban and other novel anticoagulants and the recent approval of a new reversal agent, more research is needed to develop monitoring laboratory parameters to determine and monitor their therapeutic range.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Parasternal long axis view of transthoracic echocardiogram showing large circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence for tamponade physiology.

Anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) is an uncommon but extremely important differential diagnosis that should not be missed in patients presenting with syncope, MI, ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest. A definitive diagnosis with coronary angiography and prompt surgical intervention is imperative in such symptomatic patients.Left main coronary artery (LMCA) or left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) arising from the right sinus of Valsalva or right coronary artery (RCA) is referred to as an anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA). The subsequent course is mostly between the aorta and the pulmonary artery on its way to the left ventricle, which could compress the vessel and may give rise to fatal outcomes like myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death [1, 2]. This is an uncommon case of LMCA arising from the right sinus of Valsalva in a 19-year-old man with recurrent episodes of syncope due to myocardial ischemia and infarction.A 19-year-old African American man was brought to the emergency department (ED) by emergency medical services (EMS) after an episode of syncope earlier on the day of admission while playing basketball at his college. This occurred suddenly and was associated with a transient episode of lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and blurred vision. This was followed by lost consciousness for less than 10 seconds, with spontaneous recovery as witnessed by his friends on the sidelines. There was not any involuntary movement of the body, urinary or bowel incontinence, or postictal confusion as per the witnesses. After regaining consciousness, there was a complaint of nonradiating, substernal, burning chest pain with a “6 out of 10” intensity, which lasted approximately 20–30 minutes and was relieved with a nitroglycerin sublingual pill given by EMS. On arrival to the ED, the patient was asymptomatic. Blood pressure was 103/67 mmHg, heart rate 85 bpm and regular, afebrile oxygen saturation > 95% on room air, and respiratory rate 12 per minute. Physical examination findings revealed a supple neck with no jugular venous distention; no carotid bruits were audible. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and no significant audible murmurs, parasternal heave, or thrill. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. There was no pitting pedal edema, and all peripheral pulses were palpable. The abdomen was soft and nondistended; no focal neurological deficits were evident.History was positive for two similar events in the past. The first episode occurred approximately 10 years ago in Nigeria while playing soccer, and another event occurred a year ago year while running a block to catch a bus. Medical attention was not sought on both occasions. Family history was negative for similar syncopal attacks, sudden cardiac arrest, or arrhythmias. Social history was positive for drinking heavy amounts of Vodka with friends occasionally on the weekends along with marijuana but negative for cigarette smoking or other illicit drug use.Initial laboratory values in the ED showed hemoglobin of 12.3 gm %, serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl (normal reference range 0.50 to 1.20 mg/dl) and BUN of 24 mg/dl, elevated initial troponin I of 0.23 ng/ml (normal reference range 0.00 to 0.07 ng/ml), total creatinine kinase level of 585 units/liter (normal reference range: 49 to 397 U/l), and urine with 11–20 hyaline casts. Thyroid stimulating hormone, serum potassium, and serum magnesium were within normal limits. His chest X-ray did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process (Figure 1). His initial electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed significant 4 mm to 5 mm ST depression in the anterolateral leads but otherwise unremarkable (Figure 2). A repeat EKG done within 2 hours of the initial presentation showed reversal of ST depression (Figure 3). A repeat troponin done in 6 hours revealed staggering troponin I of 53.30 ng/ml. Immediate bedside echocardiogram showed a nondilated left ventricular cavity with normal LV wall thickness and a mildly diminished LV ejection fraction at 45–50% (Figure 4). In the emergency room, immediate treatment with 325 mg of Aspirin and therapeutic Lovenox (1 mg/kg) was given. Overnight, periodic 5–7-beat runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on the cardiac monitor occurred. Cardiac tomography (CT) angiography of the heart revealed a common trunk for the right and left coronary arteries arising from the right coronary cusp. The right coronary artery had a normal course. The LMCA traveled posteriorly between the ascending aorta and pulmonary outflow tract before resuming its normal course.The LMCA narrowed in its midportion as it passed between these two structures (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). These findings were confirmed by cardiac catheterization which showed an anomalous origin of the LMCA, originating from the right sinus of Valsalva (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)). The LMCA narrowed in its midportion with over 60–70% luminal stenosis due to a stricture present between the ascending aorta and the left ventricular outflow track. Afterwards, medical stabilization was achieved and a transfer to a tertiary care center was carried out.Upon arrival at the tertiary care center, a procedure was performed involving the unroofing of the anomalous aortic origin of the left main coronary artery, including retro pulmonary unroofing by a congenital cardiothoracic surgeon. Recovery was satisfactory after the surgery, and postoperative complications did not occur.The overall incidence of the abnormal aortic origin of the coronary arteries is estimated to be approximately 0.64% of births [3]. The most common anomaly is the origin of the left circumflex artery from the right sinus of Valsalva, followed by the origin of a single coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva, origin of both the right and the left coronary arteries from the right sinus of Valsalva, and the LAD originating from the right sinus of Valsalva. The prevalence of the RCA arising from the left sinus of Valsalva is approximately 0.17% while the rarest anomaly is the left coronary artery arising from the right sinus of Valsalva and its prevalence is around 0.047% [4]. There are four major variations in the course taken by the LMCA after its origin from the right sinus of Valsalva, in relation to the aorta and the pulmonary trunk, on its way to the left ventricle. The LMCA can have a septal course beginning at the right ventricular infundibulum; it can have an anterior course, a retroaortic course, or an interarterial course between the aorta and the main pulmonary artery [5, 6].The clinical presentation in AAOCA is commonly anginal chest pain or syncope that occurs mostly with exercise or other strenuous activities. In young athletes and military recruits, the first clinical presentation may unfortunately be sudden cardiac death [7]. In a registry of sudden cardiac death in 286 athletes, the anomalous coronary artery arising from the opposite sinus of Valsalva was the second most common cause of death (13%) besides hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [8]. Though the incidence of sudden cardiac death in patients with AAOCA is low overall, it is still comparatively higher for patients with AAOCA of the left coronary artery than with AAOCA of the RCA, especially in the absence of symptoms [9].The pathophysiology behind syncope, myocardial ischemia, and sudden cardiac death has been postulated to be the compression of the anomalous coronary artery between the aorta and the pulmonary artery on its way to the left ventricle [1, 2, 10]. The intramural course and acute angle of take-off may predispose the affected artery to the obstruction of blood flow [11]. It has been proposed that there is an expansion of the aortic root and pulmonary trunk during exercise or strenuous physical activities which worsens the preexisting angulation of the coronary artery and thus reduces the diameter of the lumen in the proximal portion of the coronary artery [1]. The 19-year-old man might have had recurrent episodes of syncope and myocardial infarction on admission due to the compression of the interarterial portion of the LMCA between the aorta and the main pulmonary artery during strenuous physical activities.Diagnosis is mainly based on the high index of clinical suspicion for the anomalous origin of the coronary artery. Coronary magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA) and coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) are important noninvasive diagnostic tools that are being increasingly used to detect such cases. Several smaller studies have proven the efficacy of CMRA and CCTA [12, 13]. Coronary angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of the origin and the course of anomalous coronary arteries and is particularly important when the noninvasive test fails to yield definitive results [14]. In patients with symptoms arising from ventricular tachyarrhythmia or myocardial infarction, surgical intervention is indicated, particularly in cases of the origin of the left coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva. The surgical intervention can consist of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or unroofing (marsupialization) of the coronary artery that prevents further compression of the artery in its interarterial course [15]. For patients without any intramural course, the “hinge twist” procedure has been described [16]. Pulmonary artery translocation and intracoronary stents to prevent vessel compression are a few other alternative surgical procedures that have been described so far [17]. Benefits of surgical treatment in asymptomatic individuals with AAOCA have not been well established.The left coronary artery arising from the right sinus of Valsalva is not a frequently encountered congenital coronary artery anomaly. In younger patients presenting with symptoms of syncope, myocardial ischemia, or ventricular arrhythmias, a high index of clinical suspicion is required. This man received a diagnosis at the age of 19 years despite having prior symptoms. A future fatal outcome may have occurred if anomalous coronary artery disease was not detected and treated promptly. Definitive diagnosis with coronary angiography and prompt surgical intervention is imperative in such symptomatic patients. Data regarding outcomes of surgical intervention in asymptomatic patients are still lacking. Noninvasive tests such as echocardiography and computed tomography angiography can aid in diagnosis and are becoming increasingly popular.The authors declare no conflict of interest.
Unusual Sign from an Unusual Cause: Wellens’ Syndrome due to Myocardial Bridging
1Department of Internal Medicine, Maimonides Medical Center, New York City, NY, USA2Department of Cardiology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India3Department of Cardiology, Maimonides Medical Center, New York City, NY, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Paurush Ambesh; moc.liamg@71hsuruapReceived 18 February 2018; Accepted 24 May 2018; Published 25 July 2018Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2018 Paurush Ambesh et al.

Most commonly, it is because of blood supply-demand inequity in the myocardium. However, the phenomenon of myocardial bridging as a cause of cardiac chest pain has come to attention reasonably recently. Herein, a coronary artery with a normal epicardial orientation develops a transient myocardial course. If the cardiac muscle burden is substantial, the respective artery gets compressed during each cycle of systole, thereby impeding blood flow in the artery. Hence, myocardial bridging has been attributed to as a rare cause of angina. In this case report, the authors discuss a patient in whom myocardial bridging turned out to be an elusive cause of angina. We wish to underscore the importance of being clinically mindful of myocardial bridging when assessing a patient with angina.Chest pain of cardiac origin is commonly ischemic in etiology. However, the phenomenon of myocardial bridging as a cause of chest pain has come to attention recently. Herein, an epicardial coronary artery develops a transient myocardial course. During systole, a portion of the vessel is mechanically compressed and results in ischemia. This has been attributed to as a rare cause of angina. Here, we present a patient who was diagnosed with the same.A 51-year-old man with no past medical history presented to the emergency room with pressure-like chest pain of two-day duration. He had multiple episodes of pain, and each lasted for around 20 minutes. It was associated with palpitations and exacerbated by physical exertion. He was a former smoker and reportedly quit smoking 20 years back. His blood pressure was 153/95 mmHg, temperature 98.1°F, heart rate 73/min regular, and respiratory rate 18/min. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed Type 1 Wellens’ Biphasic pattern in leads V2 and V3. (Figure 1).Three sets of cardiac troponins were normal. Wellens’ pattern on ECG is highly specific (89%) for critical left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis [1, 2]. Therefore, the patient was sent for emergent cardiac catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed normal left main, left circumflex, and right coronary artery. However, LAD artery showed moderate myocardial bridging.In myocardial bridging, a coronary artery that runs typically on the epicardium develops a transient intramyocardial course. This section of the artery gets compressed during ventricular systole. Generally asymptomatic, myocardial bridging may cause angina, arrhythmias (supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia), myocardial ischemia or infarction, and even sudden cardiac death. The degree of ischemia has been shown to correlate with the degree of systolic compression directly.On coronary angiography, most myocardial bridging is predominantly found to occur in the middle portion of the LAD artery. However, on autopsy, the right coronary and left circumflex arteries have shown bridging at comparable rates [3].Angiographically detected rates of bridging have been reported to be 0.5–12%, with increased detection using provocative testing [4]. The proximal portion of the bridged segment is prone to accelerated atherosclerosis.Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) has shown increased association with myocardial bridging [5]. Orthotopic heart transplant recipients also show increased prevalence of myocardial bridging [6]. This occurs due to greater myocardial hypertrophy and stiffness after transplant, which in turn causes more systolic vessel compression.First-line management for myocardial bridging utilizes medical treatment with beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Therapeutic benefit results from decreased chronotropy and inotropy. This subsequently causes diastolic prolongation. Nitrates cause secondary tachycardia, with reflex sympathetic stimulation, and therefore are contraindicated. In cases refractory to medical management, surgical myotomy, coronary artery stenting, or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be pursued.Coronary stenting has been tried but is associated with serious complications like coronary artery perforation and stent fracture. Surgical myotomy may result in right ventricle dissection in patients with deep subendocardial myocardial bridges [7]. Our patient was started on aspirin, amlodipine, metoprolol, and rosuvastatin. His hospital course was uneventful, and he was discharged on pharmacological therapy. He continues to follow up in the cardiology clinic, and his symptoms are well controlled.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.Supplementary Video: coronary angiogram shows compression of proximal left anterior descending artery with each systole.

Severe Stenosis of an Anomalous Circumflex Artery Mimicking a Chronic Total Occlusion
Coronary CTO Program, Medical University of South Carolina, 30 Courtenay Street, MSC 592, Charleston, SC 29425, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Anbukarasi Maran; ude.csum@naramReceived 4 April 2018; Accepted 20 June 2018; Published 25 July 2018Academic Editor: Expedito E. RibeiroCopyright © 2018 George Mawardi and Anbukarasi Maran. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The prevalence of anomalous circumflex coronary arteries is rare. Identifying the presence of an anomalous coronary is quite easy when there is no severe stenosis. However, in the presence of severe stenosis, there is limited anterograde flow, which makes it challenging to visualize the course of the stenotic artery, and it can be assumed to be a chronic total occlusion (CTO). This case demonstrates how the anomalous circumflex artery with severe stenosis masqueraded as a CTO and the patient was treated medically for several years, despite continued symptoms. The retrograde filling of an anomalous circumflex has a specific angiographic pattern which should be recognized. This case is an excellent illustration of the said angiographic pattern.Coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) can occur in up to 30% of patients with coronary artery disease. The foundation of CTO percutaneous intervention is understanding the coronary anatomy. This case report demonstrates the pitfalls of single catheter angiography in the presence of a coronary CTO. Because of the lack of understanding of the patient’s coronary anatomy and failure to recognize the demonstrated specific angiographic pattern, the patient suffered with angina and did not receive appropriate treatment. Dual angiography is an essential initial step in patients undergoing CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to define the anatomy completely. This case report illustrates how understanding the coronary anatomy with dual angiography completely changed the approach to intervention.The patient is a 65 year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease (status post a drug-eluting stent to his right coronary artery in 2011, with occluded left circumflex), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (status post ablation in 2015, rhythm controlled, on apixaban), abdominal aortic aneurysm (status post endovascular repair), diabetes mellitus (A1C of 6%), polymyalgia rheumatica on chronic prednisone, and colon cancer (status post resection), who was admitted to the General Medicine Service for lumbar 5-sacral 1 discitis. Cardiology was consulted for chest pain. The patient normally had stable angina pectoris but now had been experiencing unstable angina and nocturnal angina. His electrocardiogram at the time demonstrated sinus rhythm with anterolateral ST segment depressions and T wave inversions and isolated ST segment elevation in aVR. He was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin, after which the chest pain and electrocardiographic changes were resolved (EKG at rest showed sinus bradycardia, occasional premature atrial contractions (PAC), and upright T waves, with no ischemic changes).About five months before the current episode, he had a nuclear stress test which demonstrated a small reversible perfusion defect of moderate severity in the basal, lateral region, consistent with mild ischemia. His ejection fraction was 53%.His cardiac medications include carvedilol, aspirin, isosorbide, and lovastatin.His physical exam was not remarkable for any physical exam findings.His echocardiogram here showed normal ejection fraction, with inferior wall hypokinesis with a pseudonormal filling pattern.A cardiac heart catheterization was recommended given the significant symptoms and significant electrocardiographic changes as part of his preoperative risk assessment.The catheterization showed that the left main bifurcates into the left anterior descending (LAD) and a small left circumflex (LCx). There was also mild disease of the mid and distal left main.The LAD wraps around the left ventricle apex, with diffuse mild-moderate disease. It gives off a large diagonal branch with mild diffuse disease (Figure 1).The LCx was described as a small vessel with proximal occlusion at the takeoff of a large marginal branch that has mild diffuse disease (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)).The right coronary artery (RCA) is a dominant vessel with a focal area of moderate eccentric disease in the mid vessel. Otherwise, it has mild diffuse disease. It gives off a large posterior descending artery (PDA) and posterolateral branch (PLB) that directly provide retrograde collateral supply to the distal atrioventricular (A-V) circumflex. The A-V circumflex turns at an acute angle away from the left main artery (Figure 3) (video file 1).The patient underwent uncomplicated back surgery. He continued to have exertional angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class III-IV) with substernal chest tightness and radiation to the shoulder with minimal activity and at rest at night. Symptoms were relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. He was subsequently referred for hemodynamic assessment of the left main and left anterior descending with planned CTO PCI of the occluded circumflex.During CTO PCI, initial dual angiogram demonstrated that the RCA collateral to the circumflex was in a different plane than the left main coronary artery (Figure 4).This raised the suspicion that the circumflex artery was probably anomalous in origin (Figure 5).Further probing of the right coronary cusp demonstrated an anomalous origin of the circumflex artery. The patient did not have CTO of the circumflex but instead had severe stenosis of his anomalous circumflex (Figure 6).The patient was found to have an anomalous left circumflex artery, the most common coronary anomaly. Fractional flow reserve of the left main and the left anterior descending were 0.91 at rest and 0.82 at hyperaemia.The patient underwent successful PCI of the anomalous circumflex with drug-eluting stents (Figure 7) (video file 1).The patient did not have CTO of the left circumflex artery as described in his cardiac catheterizations previously but instead had severe stenosis of his anomalous circumflex artery. Angiographic pattern recognition of an anomalous course of a coronary artery in the presence of severe stenosis/chronic total occlusion is of importance to avoid treatment delays. The patient was followed up in a cardiology clinic 4 weeks after the procedure. He was angina free and had stopped taking long-acting nitrates.Coronary anomalies generally are reported to be present in about 0.2–1.3% in the population based on angiographic studies and about 0.3% based on autopsy studies [1, 2]. The most common anatomic variation is an anomalous left circumflex artery, present in about 0.7% of patients [1]. The circumflex invariably courses posterior to the aortic root. The artery can arise from a separate ostium within the right sinus or as a proximal branch of the right coronary artery. The arterial course to the aorta and pulmonary artery relationship has been associated with many serious conditions, including congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and even sudden death [3–6]. This sudden death phenomena is thought to may be due to the fact that the vessel’s tangential origin during demand can lead to ischemia and arrhythmias [7]. Retroaortic portion of the anomalous circumflex also predisposes patients to atherosclerotic disease [1]. In this case, there was severe stenosis in the anomalous circumflex artery which mimicked a CTO. Because of this, the patient was treated medically and suffered with angina for more than 6 years and did not receive appropriate treatment.Even though the patient was referred for CTO PCI, he did not have a CTO. However, the systematic approach to CTO PCI helped in identifying the anomalous coronary anatomy. Chronic total occlusion interventions (CTO PCI) are increasing in frequency secondary to advances in techniques and development of the North American Hybrid Algorithm [8]. Despite the increase in CTO PCI, many non-CTO operators attempt the conventional wiring techniques, where a guide wire is attempted to be passed across the lesion without proper visualization of the distal vessel with dual angiogram. Conventional work horse wires with over-the-wire (OTW) balloons are usually used. This has been called the “Poke and Hope” technique. In some cases, this results in complete dissection and shut down of the vessel or wire perforation of the native vessel. In the case that we have described, if the “Poke and Hope” technique was to be used, it would have resulted in perforation of a small branch coming off the left anterior descending artery which was initially thought to be the diminutive left circumflex artery.This case demonstrates the importance of dual angiography in clearly defining the coronary anatomy. Dual angiography remains the cornerstone for decision making on CTO PCI [9]. The angiogram of the right coronary artery with the right posterolateral branch giving collateral flow to the atrioventricular circumflex branch is the second most common collateral pattern for circumflex CTOs [10]; however, the turn taken by the A-V circumflex vessel is not the usual course. In the normal course of the circumflex artery, the artery runs towards the left main artery. In the case that we have described, the circumflex runs in a different plane from the left main artery, which should raise suspicion of an anomalous origin of the circumflex. Therefore, angiographic pattern recognition of this coronary angiogram is of extreme importance. If this angiographic pattern was recognized during his initial cardiac catheterization, the patient would have received appropriate treatment for his angina pectoris.This case report serves to reiterate the unusual angiographic pattern of the anomalous circumflex artery in the presence of severe stenosis, which mimicked a chronic total occlusion. Furthermore, recognition of this angiographic pattern can facilitate further evaluation for the presence of an anomalous artery and PCI can be done in the same setting. Delays in patient care can be avoided.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.The video starts with the diagnostic angiogram of the patient. The first image is a left anterior oblique/caudal projection demonstrating the left main artery with moderate disease in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and moderate to severe disease in a small ramus branch. There is a small stump of the circumflex artery. The second image is a right anterior oblique/cranial projection demonstrating the LAD artery. The third image shows a left anterior oblique/cranial projection of the right coronary artery (RCA) with the posterolateral branch providing retrograde collaterals to the circumflex artery. Percutaneous intervention: the first image is a dual angiogram in the anteroposterior/caudal projection. There is a guide catheter in the right coronary artery to visualize the retrograde collateral filling and a guide catheter in the left main artery to visualize antegrade flow of the circumflex artery. This demonstrates that the collateral filling of the circumflex runs in a different plane from the circumflex stump of the left main—suggestive of an anomalous origin and course of the circumflex artery. The second image is the same dual angiogram in the left anterior oblique/caudal projection—confirming the anomalous course of the circumflex artery. The third image is a dual angiogram in the left anterior oblique projection with a guide catheter in the RCA and the second guide catheter in the anomalous ostium of the circumflex which is arising from the right coronary cusp. This demonstrates the entire course of the anomalous circumflex artery and also the severe stenosis in the proximal portion of this artery. The severe stenosis in this anomalous artery was wired with a workhorse wire and predilated with a compliant balloon. The vessel was evaluated by intravascular ultrasound which demonstrated severe fibrofatty disease in the circumflex (not visualized). The vessel was then treated with drug-eluting stents. The last image demonstrates the excellent final results with TIMI III flow in the anomalous circumflex artery. (Supplementary Materials)
Therapeutic Dilemma of Natural Watchman: Congenital Absence of the Left Atrial Appendage
1Department of Internal Medicine, Central Michigan University, Saginaw, MI, USA2Department of Electrophysiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA3Department of Electrophysiology, Good Samaritan Hospital, Dayton, OH, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Phoo Pwint Nandar; moc.liamg@62radnanppReceived 25 May 2018; Accepted 12 July 2018; Published 25 July 2018Academic Editor: Kuan-Rau ChiouCopyright © 2018 Phoo Pwint Nandar et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Congenital absence of the left atrial appendage is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly which is usually an incidental finding. We present a rare case of congenital absence of the left atrial appendage in a 77-year-old female patient with atrial fibrillation, and we will discuss the role of anticoagulation in the patient with congenital absence of the left atrial appendage based on the scientific data and theoretic background.Congenital absence of the left atrial appendage (CALAA) is an extremely rare congenital cardiac anomaly. Given the fact that it is very rare, its clinical significance and the chance of developing intracardiac thrombi are largely unknown. There are only a handful case reports noted in the medical literature, and none of them reported intracardiac thrombi. The anticoagulation therapy in patients with CALAA remains unclear.A 77-year-old female with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) presented with palpitations. She has neither prior cardiovascular procedure nor cardiac surgery. AF was diagnosed 4 years ago, and she was started on oral anticoagulation with warfarin. She was active and independent. She was very symptomatic with frequent palpitations. Dofetilide was started for rhythm control. She was successfully cardioverted in January 2017 while on dofetilide and warfarin. However, she went back to AF in March 2017. Dofetilide dose was adjusted. Then, she converted to sinus rhythm and always reported to be compliant with the medication. In May 2017, she had palpitations and was found to be in AF again. Given the fact that symptomatic AF is affecting her daily life and she failed rhythm control therapy, ablation was offered. She underwent cryoablation and pulmonary vein isolation procedure.Computed tomography angiogram of the pulmonary veins (Figures 1–3) and transesophageal echocardiogram (Figures 4 and 5) were ordered prior to the procedure as evaluations for the cardiac anatomy and to rule out intracardiac thrombi, which revealed she had no left atrial appendage. Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin was continued as per current guidelines since we have no data on anticoagulation management in CALAA.LAA is a small muscular extension abutting from the upper part of the left atrium. Embryologically, the LAA develops as early as the third week of embryonic life [1]. The LAA produces a high level of atrial natriuretic factor and contributes to the contractile function of the left atrium [2]. In adults, it is described as a narrow, tubular, single or multilobed structure functioning as a decompression chamber during left ventricular systole and other periods of high left atrial pressure [1].The major clinical significance of the LAA is not in the functionality but for its lethality. In the past, the left atrial appendage (LAA) has been considered to be a relatively insignificant portion of cardiac anatomy. It is now recognized that it is a structure with important pathological associations [1]. The LAA is the only area within the left atrium that is composed of pectinate muscle and creates a milieu that is conducive to blood stasis and thrombus formation. It is estimated that up to 90% of AF-related thrombi are located in the LAA [3]. Approximately 87% of all strokes are ischemic infarctions [4]. Cardiogenic embolism is responsible for 14–30% of all ischemic strokes [5]. A multicenter study has found that patients with the chicken wing morphology are significantly less likely to have an embolic event compared to those with cactus, windsock, and cauliflower morphologies [6].Evaluation of the LAA by cardiac imaging studies prior to intracardiac procedures is usually done to rule out intracardiac thrombi. Reduced or absent LAA inflow and outflow velocities and low LAA ejection fractions are associated with LAA thrombus formation [1]. Oral anticoagulants are the current standard of care in preventing CVA in patients with AF. However, all anticoagulants such as warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban carry the risk of bleeding. They are contraindicated in patients with prior hemorrhagic strokes and untreated bleeding disorders. Obliterating the LAA with the device (Watchman device) has been recently approved as an alternative option for patients who cannot tolerate long-term anticoagulation therapy. The remarkably successful Watchman trials have demonstrated that the Watchman device competes favorably with warfarin in terms of stroke and cardiovascular mortality [7].Advanced sonographic techniques such as biplane and multiplane TEE have enabled physicians to visualize the LAA in most cases [8]. Nonvisualization of the LAA during TTE can be due to either of the following causes: (A) fresh thrombus, (B) variant anatomical features, (C) poor echocardiographic window, (D) prior surgical ligation, (E) presence of an implanted occluder device, or (F) CALAA [2]. For further differentiation, detailed history taking, looking at prior surgical records, and highly sophisticated imaging modalities like multidetector CT and cardiac MRI would be of immense help [8]. Clamping of the LAA during cardiac surgery results in an increase in left atrial pressure and dimension as well as in transmitral and pulmonary diastolic flow velocities [9]. Because of its increased distensibility, the LAA may augment hemodynamic function by modulating left atrial pressure-volume relations in the states of increased left atrial pressure and volume overload [10].Theoretically, the risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in CALAA should be lower since it removes the anatomical source of cardiac embolism [11]. However, there is no strong scientific data suggesting a favorable prognosis of CALAA and lower incidence of left atrium thrombus formation. The clinical implication for CALAA with AF in terms of anticoagulation even after ablation procedures still remains a mystery [12]. Given the fact of a very low incidence of CALAA, it is not likely to have a randomized trial on anticoagulation therapy.According to the 2017 expert consensus statement on ablation of AF, the decision to discontinue anticoagulation after ablation should be based on the patient’s stroke risk profile, not on the clinical outcome of the procedure [13]. Therefore, in the case we presented, anticoagulation was continued even after a successful ablation because her CHA2DS2-VASc score was >2, and there is no proven data on the safety of discontinuation of anticoagulation in CALAA.CALAA is a very rare anomaly, which can change anticoagulation management strategies in a patient with AF, and there is very limited data to confirm the lower risk of stroke in a patient with CALAA. Given the importance of the LAA in the clot formation and embolization causing CVA in an AF patient, whether its congenital absence decreases the risk of thrombus formation is yet to be seen.The case report was previously presented as a poster presentation at the Miami Valves 2018 conference on February 3, 2018.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.The corresponding author would like to thank her colleagues for their wonderful collaborations and support.
The Mysterious Mitral Mass: A Case of Valvular Myxoma

The vast majority of cardiac myxomas arise from the left atrium near the fossa ovalis of the intra-atrial septum. There have been reports of myxomas arising from the ventricles accounting for about 5% of cases. In our literature review, we have found 55 reported cases of myxomas originating from the mitral valve reported in the adult population dating back to 1871. The majority of these cases presented with embolic complications or syncope. We present an incidental mitral valve myxoma which we excised in efforts to prevent debilitating complications.Myxomas are the most common primary heart tumors accounting for 40–50% of primary cardiac tumors. These neoplasms are typically located in the left atrium; however, there have been cases of ventricular myxomas and, very rarely, valvular myxomas [1–3]. These lesions are usually benign and require surgical management. Complications associated with these masses may include those related to outflow obstruction and those related to pulmonary or systemic embolization [4, 5]. These tumors are typically sporadic although there does exist an autosomal dominant transmission in Carney’s syndrome. Carney’s syndrome is thought to account for about 7% of myxomas and is believed to be related to abnormalities in the second chromosome [6]. Other manifestations of Carney’s syndrome include cutaneous myxomas, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and endocrinopathies [7]. We hope to further highlight other features of myxomas, methods of diagnosis, and management within this script.A 53-year-old female was admitted for evaluation of flank pain radiating to the left lower quadrant of her abdomen. Relevant past medical history includes previous left renal calculi requiring ureteral stenting and nonischemic cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. Laboratory studies were remarkable for leukocytosis and acute renal injury. Imaging studies revealed multiple adjacent obstructing calculi in the mid left ureter causing moderate left-sided hydronephrosis. Patient was boarded for emergent cystoscopy and underwent left ureteral stent placement with no intraoperative events.Given the patient’s history of cardiomyopathy, she underwent preoperative cardiac evaluation revealing a 10 × 10 mm mitral valve “vegetation” on transthoracic echocardiogram. Initial concern was for endocarditis, and the patient was started on antibiotic therapy. However, blood cultures obtained on admission remained free of microbial growth and the patient exhibited no symptoms consistent with overt endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram done to better delineate the consistency of the lesion revealed a 10 × 7 mm noncalcified mass with uniform echodensity located on the atrial side of P2 (Figures 1 and 2). Differential diagnosis at this time included myxoma, papillary fibroelastoma, liposarcoma, and less likely, an infectious vegetation. Left heart catheterization revealed nonobstructive coronary artery disease and mild mitral regurgitation.Given the increased risk of embolization with mitral valve masses greater than 1 cm, we decided to undergo minimally invasive mitral valve excision and valve repair with P2 resection. Histopathological findings confirmed a 9.0 × 8.0 × 6.0 mm myxoma (Figure 3) attached to the external valve leaflet. The tumor was composed of stellate cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, indistinct boarders, oval nucleus with open chromatin, and indistinct nuclei in the background of a myxoid substance (Figures 4 and 5). The patient’s postoperative course was complicated by respiratory insufficiency likely related to obstructive sleep apnea which resolved within a few days following the procedure. Patient was discharged home with multidisciplinary outpatient follow-up.Primary cardiac tumors are rare with an incidence of less than one-tenth of a percent. In contrast, secondary cardiac tumors have been reported to be 20 times more common. The vast majority (>75%) of cardiac tumors are benign with the majority of those in adults being myxomas [3]. A meta-analysis which reviewed 1029 patients found that 83% of myxomas were located in the left atrial cavity and 12.7% were found within the right atrial cavity. Of these, it is estimated that 1–5% originate from the mitral valve leaflets [4]. As seen in our case, it is important to differentiate these masses from other valvular lesions as management would be vastly different. One must consider the possibility of infectious vegetation and papillary fibroelastoma.Infective endocarditis is commonly associated with cardiac vegetations which appear as masses or flakes of various sizes. Typical echocardiographic findings associated with infective vegetations include localization on the upstream side of the valve, chaotic and orbiting motion independent of valve motion, and lobulated and amorphous shape. There may be associated abscess, pseudoaneurysm, paravalvular leak, or regurgitation [6–9].Papillary fibroelastomas are valvular lesions typically located more commonly on the aortic valve but also may present on the other valve. These benign tumors are the second most common primary cardiac tumor in adults. Their appearance is compared to sea anemones as they have a characteristic central core with “arms” extending from the base [9]. On echocardiography, they appear as small, well-demarcated masses with uniform echodensity. These tumors may be round, oval, or irregular in appearance. The vast majority of these tumors are <20 mm in diameter. Nearly 50% of these tumors will have a stalk which may or may not be mobile [9–12].The diagnosis of mitral valve myxomas is most commonly achieved with a combination of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. These methods are relatively inexpensive, noninvasive, and widely available making them ideal in the initial evaluation of cardiac tumors. Echocardiography also provides an added benefit of assessing flow dynamics which may be altered based on the size of the cardiac mass. Cardiac MRI and CT can also provide useful information in assessing cardiac masses as they provide for much better resolution [13–16]. Histopathologic identification of stellate cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and indistinct borders is diagnostic.The treatment of mitral valve myxomas involves resection and, in our case, repair of the involved mitral valve. Our literature has also shown replacement of the mitral valve to be common practice based on the extent of involvement. Excision of the myxoma is recommended to avoid complications which include but are not limited to arrhythmias, heart failure, syncope, and embolism (tumor or thrombotic). Periodic reevaluation with echocardiography is recommended to assess for recurrence [15–18].The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.
Successful Treatment of Occlusive Left Main Coronary Artery Dissection by Impella-Supported Stenting
Detroit Medical Center Heart Hospital, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USACorrespondence should be addressed to James J. Glazier; moc.liamtoh@reizalgjsemajReceived 23 May 2018; Accepted 8 July 2018; Published 15 July 2018Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2018 James J. Glazier et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We report successful treatment of a patient, who, during diagnostic angiography, developed an ostial left main coronary artery dissection with stump occlusion of the vessel. First, mechanical circulatory support with an Impella CP device was established. Then, patency of the left coronary system was achieved by placement of stents in the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and left main coronary arteries. On completion of the procedure, left ventricular systolic function, as assessed by echocardiography, was normal. At 24-month clinical follow-up, the patient remains angina-free and well. This is the first reported case of the use of an Impella device to support treatment of iatrogenic left main coronary artery dissection.The Impella device is a percutaneously inserted miniaturized ventricular assist device that is being increasingly used in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) [1–4]. It has also been found to have a potentially valuable role in increasing the safety and efficacy of high-risk coronary interventional procedures (PCI), such as stenting of unprotected left main stem coronary artery (ULMCA) [5]. Using a retrograde femoral (or, occasionally, axillary) artery access, it is generally placed using standard percutaneous techniques in the left ventricular chamber (LV) across the aortic valve. The device pumps blood from the left ventricle into the ascending aorta and systemic circulation at an upper rate between 2.5 and 5.0 L/min, depending on the particular model type. The device provides almost immediate and sustained unloading of the left ventricle while increasing overall systemic cardiac output with maintenance of mean arterial pressure [1, 2]. Recently, an increasing body of evidence has suggested that in AMICS, a strategy of first implanting the Impella device before performing PCI is associated with improved survival [3, 4]. In particular, a recent report by Meraj et al. [6] suggests that initiation of cardiac mechanical support by Impella prior to PCI on ULMCA culprit lesion in AMCIS is associated with significantly improved early survival compared to Impella support following PCI. We now report our application of these observations in the treatment of a patient with catheter-induced obliterative occlusion of the LMCA.A 58-year-old woman with a history of current cigarette smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency room at our center reporting recurrent episodes of severe central chest pain over the preceding 24 hours. While her ECG showed no significant ST segment shifts, troponin I levels were slightly increased (0.025 ng/mL). Accordingly, she was referred for coronary angiography in the setting of a non-ST segment elevation MI.Catheterization was performed via the right radial artery using the 6 French (F) Amplatz R1 and 6F Judkins L 3.5 diagnostic catheters (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). The only angiographic abnormality noted was a moderate stenosis of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) (Figure 1). To further assess the physiological significance of this stenosis, an iFFR PrimeWire (Volcano Corp, San Diego, CA, USA) was placed in the LAD, following exchange of the Judkins catheter for a 6F Extra Back-Up (EBU) 3.5 guiding catheter (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Of note, initial angiography through the EBU guide catheter prior to advancing the wire showed good coronary flow. It was, however, not possible to advance the wire to the lesion. Accordingly, the PrimeWire was removed from the vessel and then an angiogram of the left coronary artery was taken. Angiography revealed only a stump of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) with occlusion of both the LAD and of the circumflex (LCx) coronary arteries (Figure 2). Marked (3 mm) anterior ST segment elevation then developed, and the patient became progressively hypotensive with systolic pressure falling to a nadir of 58 mmHg. Inotropic and pressor infusions were commenced.We, at this point, decided to establish mechanical circulatory support with the Impella CP device (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA) prior to attempting to reestablish patency of the left coronary system with stents. We first placed a 6F sheath in the left femoral artery. Just as we gained access, the patient developed ventricular fibrillation. This was immediately treated with one 150-Joule biphasic nonsynchronized shock. Following this, the 6F sheath was changed out over a 0.35 Wholey wire (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) for a long 8F arterial sheath. Then, a 6F multipurpose diagnostic catheter was advanced through the sheath to the LV. Next, the Impella 0.18 deployment wire was advanced through the multipurpose catheter to the LV and the multipurpose catheter then withdrawn. The 8F sheath was then changed out for a 14F sheath, and the Impella CP device advanced over the wire to the LV. The wire was withdrawn, and satisfactory positioning of the device was confirmed by fluoroscopy with the inflow within the LV and the outflow above the aortic valve. The Impella device was then activated and placed on “auto mode” which allows the device to ramp to P9 level resulting in a cardiac output of 3.5 L/min. The mean arterial pressure increased to 80 mmHg, and there was no further occurrence of ventricular dysrhythmias.Having initiated mechanical circulatory support, we then set out to reestablish patency of the left coronary system. A 0.014 Runthrough guidewire (Terumo, Somerset, NJ, USA) was advanced into the LCx artery, and a second 0.014 Runthrough wire advanced into the LAD. The vessels were then dilated with 2.0 mm × 20 mm and 2.5 mm × 20 mm Trek (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) balloons with restoration of flow first in the LAD and then in the LCx.We then placed a 3.0 mm × 18 mm Resolute stent (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) from the LM to the LAD. Next, we rewired the LCx through the LAD stent struts. We then stented the LCx with a 3.0 mm × 38 mm Resolute stent. After this, a 3.0 mm × 20 mm Trek balloon was placed within the LAD stent, and a 2.5 mm × 15 mm Trek balloon placed within the LCx stent. Final deployment of the stents was with simultaneous inflation of the 2 balloons (kissing balloon dilation) (Figure 3). Finally, a 4.0 mm × 9 mm Resolute stent was deployed from the shaft to the ostium of the LM. Angiography demonstrated reestablishment of patency of the LM, LAD, and LCx (Figure 4), and intravascular ultrasound of the LAD and LM showed good stent apposition in these vessels. Immediately on completion of the procedure, a 2D echocardiogram was performed in the lab. This showed normal LV systolic function (LVEF = 55%). By this time, all inotropic and pressor agents had been discontinued. The patient was then weaned from the Impella device, and the device was removed from the cardiac catheterization laboratory. At our center, the usual approach to device removal is with suture-mediated closure. Because of the emergent need for Impella support in our patient, a technique of crossover balloon tamponade was used (Figure 5) with completion angiography to confirm hemostasis and absence of femoral artery abnormality or complication (Figure 6). The general approach at our center to cases of primary PCI in the setting of cardiogenic shock is to retain the Impella hemodynamic support for a minimum of 24 hours to allow for myocardial recovery. However, in this case, because of the rapid identification of shock and the prompt recovery of mean arterial pressure and the ability to discontinue all pressor support, we elected to remove the device while in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. An additional parameter that supported the latter decision was demonstration of a mixed venous oxygen saturation ≥ 65% on P3 setting for 30 minutes.Following her procedure, the patient did well with no recurrence of symptoms, hemodynamic abnormalities, or dysrhythmias, and she was discharged home 2 days later. Follow-up coronary angiography 6 months after the initial procedure (Figure 7) showed continuing patency of the left coronary system without any significant residual stenosis. At 24-month clinical follow-up, the patient remains angina-free and with continuing normal LV systolic function.Iatrogenic LMCA dissection, although rare, is a dreaded complication of diagnostic coronary angiography, often dubbed “the angiographer’s nightmare.” It has potentially devastating complications, including death on the cath lab table. It is usually treated with immediate stenting [7–10]. However, we judged that initial stenting might not be the optimal initial strategy in our patient. Most reports regarding iatrogenic LMCA dissection have described patients with a nonocclusive pattern with residual continued flow in the LAD and LCx. In contrast, our patient had an extreme form of dissection with amputation of the LMCA and no flow in the LAD or LCx. With such a dissection, successful advancement of guidewires first into the true lumen of the LMCA and then into the true lumina of the LAD and LCx can be technically challenging and time-consuming, with no guarantee of eventual success. Moreover, our patient was hemodynamically unstable and needed urgent institution of additional circulatory support to prevent development of refractory cardiogenic shock.Of the available mechanical support devices, the Impella device seemed particularly suited to our patient. This device can be inserted quickly and provides almost immediate unloading of the LV and increased cardiac output and maintenance of mean arterial pressure. The particular Impella model used in our patient was the Impella CP. This pumps blood from the LV to the systemic circulation at a rate up to 4.0 L/min. This effect was demonstrated in our patient, who became hemodynamically stable within a few minutes of initiation of the Impella support. Thus, it allowed us to undertake, in a stable setting, the technically demanding and complex task of wiring and then performing bifurcation stenting using a two-stent technique of the occluded left coronary system. This stability was likely a key factor in achieving the excellent angiographic and durable clinical results out to 24 months seen in our patient. Without the Impella device, we would likely have had to attempt complex PCI on a background of recurrent malignant ventricular dysrhythmias and progressive hypotension despite escalating doses of inotropes and pressors. The Impella device also served as a potential valuable bridge to coronary bypass surgery in the event that we were unsuccessful in restoring left coronary patency by PCI.Other authors [8, 10] have described the use of the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), as opposed to the Impella device, to provide hemodynamic support during coronary stent placement for left main dissection. However, in comparison to the Impella CP device, the ability of IABP to augment cardiac output is very modest: no more than 0.5 L/min [1]. The superior hemodynamic effect of the Impella device was a key factor in choosing this device over IABP in our patient. In addition, our large experience with the Impella (we implant >150 devices per year) allows us to implant this device in about the same time it takes to implant an IABP. However, we concede that there is a lack of evidence based on randomized controlled clinical trials to favor the use of the Impella over the IABP either in patients with cardiogenic shock [11] or in patients undergoing high-risk PCI [12].Recently, an increasing body of evidence suggests that in patients with cardiogenic shock (as was the case for our patient), early initiation of Impella (i.e., initiation before PCI) (as was done in our patient) is associated with increased patient survival when compared with a strategy of initiating Impella after PCI [3, 4, 6]. In the reported data set, early initiation of Impella provides effective left ventricular unloading while maintaining adequate systemic and coronary perfusion and thus prevents the downward spiral of cardiogenic shock. These data provide further support for the interventional strategy used in the presently reported patient.If the operator and cardiac catheterization laboratory have limited experience in Impella implantation, an excessive amount of time may be spent in attempting to implant the device. Accordingly, in such situations, it may be preferable that the operator proceeds directly to attempting to wire the occluded vessel.The results of a recently reported study suggest that in non-CS patients undergoing LMCA PCI, prophylactic insertion of the Impella ventricular assist device may be associated with improved procedural success rates and reduced complication rates [5]. Accordingly, Impella insertion prior to LMCA stenting may also be considered in selected hemodynamically stable patients with iatrogenic LMCA dissection.In the treatment of iatrogenic LMCA dissection, a strategy of initial insertion of the Impella device followed by LMCA stenting should be considered favorably in all those with hemodynamic instability as well as in selected hemodynamically stable patients.Dr. Amir Kaki is a proctor and speaker for Abiomed.

Inflammatory Pericardial Pseudocyst Secondary to Atrial Myocardial Perforation: A Rare Complication following Transvenous Pacemaker Implantation

We describe a case of an acquired iatrogenic pericardial pseudocyst following permanent pacemaker implantation secondary to atrial myocardial perforation. Diagnosis was achieved by a plain chest film, echocardiography, and computed tomography and confirmed intraoperatively. The pseudocyst was resected via a midline sternotomy approach. The patient recovered uneventfully. In a follow-up of 18 months, the patient is doing well.Pericardial cyst is an uncommon clinical-pathological entity with an estimated occurrence rate of 1 in 100,000 inhabitants [1]. Mostly, the etiology is congenital. Acquired causes include inflammatory disorders, rheumatic pericarditis, and infections such as tuberculosis and following cardiac surgery [2]. Most pericardial cysts are asymptomatic. Clinical symptoms are related to complications such as bleeding, infection, and rupture. Very rare complications include congestive heart failure, arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, cardiac tamponade, ventricular outflow obstruction, and sudden cardiac death [1]. Permanent transvenous pacemaker insertion is a safe procedure with a low complication rate [3]. We herein describe for an iatrogenic inflammatory pericardial pseudocyst after a permanent pacemaker insertion.A fifty-year-old female patient presented with a one month history of dry cough and dyspnea. One year prior to this admission, she underwent a permanent pacemaker implantation for idiopathic third-degree atrioventricular block. Twenty days after pacemaker insertion, she returned to the hospital with a burning chest pain. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated a small amount of pericardial effusion. A diagnosis of pericarditis secondary to pacemaker insertion was made, and she was treated with colchicine. Repeat echocardiogram showed persistent small pericardial effusion. The patient was asymptomatic until one month prior to this admission when she developed dyspnea, dry cough, and fever. Vital signs on admission were respiratory rate of 20/minute, blood pressure 109/66 mmHg, heart rate 121/minute, and temperature 37.1°C. Room air oxygen saturation was 95%. Otherwise, her physical examination was unremarkable. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs, rub, or other abnormal sounds. Chest film showed a round opacity with smooth borders in the midright lung field—a major change compared to prior films (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). Blood tests were remarkable for white blood cell count of 15,000 · 10E9/L and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 6.25 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed thickened pericardium with pericardial effusion (Figure 1(c), blue arrow), a 6.8 × 6.2 cm thick-walled pericardial cystic mass (blue stars) adjacent to the tip of atrial pacemaker lead suspected to be extracardiac (yellow arrow). TTE showed moderate amount of pericardial effusion and the cystic mass. Given her clinical presentation and the differential diagnosis, we elected to excise the mass. The chest was opened via a midsternotomy incision. We found a large (7.0 × 2.5 × 0.7 cm) cystic mass. Macroscopically, the cyst wall was thickened with intense fibrosis, areas of hemorrhages, and active inflammation (Figure 2). The orifice of the cyst was opposite the tip of the atrial pacemaker lead, which was covered by intense fibrosis. The cystic mass was completely excised, carefully preserving the right phrenic nerve. Histological examination revealed a lack of the epithelial lining over the inner surface, scattered ulcerations, fibrin depositions, hemorrhages, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and chronic inflammation (Figure 3). The patient recovered uneventfully. In a follow-up of 18 months, the patient is asymptomatic in functional class I. Follow-up plain chest film is normal. Repeat echocardiogram showed no pericardial pathology.Primary pericardial cyst is an uncommon congenital clinical-pathological entity with a benign clinical course. Rare complications of benign pericardial cysts include rupture, bleeding, and compression of adjacent structures. Surgical removal of the cyst is indicated for very large-sized cysts, when complication occurs or when the diagnosis is uncertain [2].Pacemaker insertion is a safe procedure with a 3% incidence of major complications, including perforation of heart chambers with or without tamponade, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and air embolism [4]. In the present case, diagnosis of early postpacemaker implantation pericarditis was established by clinical presentation, laboratory data, and echocardiography. A normal plain film of the chest immediately after pacemaker implantation, the close proximity of the pacemaker lead to the orifice of the pseudocyst, and the histopathological findings are all highly suggestive that repetitive mechanical trauma of the pericardium by the perforated atrial pacemaker lead caused fibrinous pericarditis followed by an inflammatory pericardial pseudocyst. Being unaware of this unique clinical-pathological entity, we elected to explore the chest, excise the lesion to establish a diagnosis in a young patient with a rapidly enlarging mediastinal mass, and manage the perforated atrial lead. Complete excision of the pseudocyst was achieved. The perforated pacemaker electrode tip was sealed by an intense fibrotic response and therefore was left in place.In conclusion, inflammatory pericardial pseudocyst, most likely, due to repetitive trauma by a perforated lead, is a rare complication of transvenous pacemaker implantation. It should be included in the differential diagnosis of postprocedural enlarging cystic mediastinal mass.The authors declare no conflict of interest regarding this manuscript.Mohammad Mowaswes, Tawfik Khoury, and Oz M.

May-Thurner Syndrome as a Rare Cause of Paradoxical Embolism in a Patient with Patent Foramen Ovale

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.May-Thurner syndrome is an underrecognized anatomical variant that can lead to increased propensity for venous thrombosis in the lower extremities. We present a case of a 67-year-old female who presented with transient ischemic attack. Initial workup including CT scan of the head, MRI scan of the head, and magnetic resonance angiogram of the head and neck was unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble study was also normal. Subsequently, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed that revealed a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunt. Lower extremity duplex venous ultrasound showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. However, magnetic resonance venogram of the pelvis showed compression of the left common iliac vein just after its origin suggestive of May-Thurner syndrome. Hence, May-Thurner syndrome was recognized as the probable source of paradoxical embolism causing transient ischemic attack in this patient.May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) or iliocaval compression is an uncommon anatomical variant characterized by external compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery against the lumbar vertebra [1]. MTS commonly presents as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or with clinical features of chronic venous insufficiency. However, there has been growing evidence associating MTS with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) caused by paradoxical embolism in the setting of patent foramen ovale (PFO). Recognition and follow-up of MTS in these scenarios are important.A 67-year-old female with past medical history of congenital deafness presented to the emergency room with complaints of right-sided facial droop and right upper extremity weakness, tingling, and numbness. These symptoms were sudden in onset and lasted for a few minutes. Symptoms had completely resolved at the time of presentation. She did not have a history of any atherosclerotic risk factor including hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia. The initial set of vital signs were normal; routine laboratory tests including complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable. A computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast as well as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast did not show any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.The patient was diagnosed with TIA, and further investigations were planned to determine the etiology. A magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the head and neck with and without contrast did not show any arterial flow limiting stenosis or occlusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with bubble study using agitated normal saline contrast was performed and was found to be normal. Patient’s heart rhythm was monitored with continuous cardiac monitoring, and no arrhythmias were noted during her stay at the hospital. At this point, the patient was identified as having cryptogenic TIA, having failed to determine the precise etiology from routine workup. Patient was started on aspirin therapy and discharged from the hospital on day 3 with further outpatient workup planned. Outpatient workup for hypercoagulability showed a high factor VIII activity of 153%, which potentially put her at increased risk of venous thromboembolism. However, this test was performed just one week after the thrombotic event and was hence difficult to interpret. Subsequently, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed that revealed a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunt. This raised the concern for paradoxical embolism as the cause of patient’s TIA. Lower extremity duplex venous ultrasound showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. However, magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) of pelvis showed compression of the left common iliac vein just after its origin, which was suggestive of May-Thurner syndrome (Figure 1). There was no evidence of venous thrombosis on the MRV. May-Thurner syndrome was recognized as the probable source of paradoxical embolism causing TIA in the patient. The patient was eventually referred for percutaneous PFO repair, which was performed without any complications. The patient had been regularly followed yearly at the cardiology clinic for 5 years now. She remains in good health with no further episodes of TIA.Cryptogenic stroke or TIA is a clinical entity that describes stroke or TIA in a patient where the initial routine workup is negative. Hence, no obvious evidence of large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, or small artery disease is discovered on initial evaluation. Up to 40% of ischemic strokes are eventually classified as cryptogenic [2, 3]. Most cryptogenic strokes/TIAs are thought to be thromboembolic. Paradoxical embolism originating from a venous source has been identified as a potential cause of stroke/TIA in patients with PFO. The association of paradoxical embolism and cryptogenic stroke/TIA is backed up by the fact that a higher prevalence of PFO has been documented in patients with cryptogenic stroke (up to 56%) as compared to the general population (20 to 26%) [4–7]. These patients usually have a lower prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes [8].In patients presenting with stroke or TIA where the initial workup is negative, further workup should include echocardiogram with bubble studies to look for a PFO. TTE with bubble study is the more popular initial test used to diagnose PFO. Although it is highly specific, it has low sensitivity when compared to TEE. In a meta-analysis of 13 studies performed by Mojadidi et al., the accuracy of TTE to detect intracardiac right-to-left shunt was compared to TEE as the reference [9]. The weighted sensitivity and specificity for TTE were found to be 46% and 99%, respectively. Hence, although TTE is highly specific for the detection of right-to-left intracardiac shunts, a negative test with TTE does not rule out the presence of a PFO and the same should be confirmed by a TEE.When a PFO is detected during the workup of stroke or TIA, further investigations should be performed to look for venous thrombosis as a source of paradoxical embolism. Lower extremity duplex venous ultrasound is often the initial test performed in these patients to exclude lower extremity DVT. However, pelvic and iliac vein thrombosis can be missed with ultrasound because of overlying bowel gas [10]. Furthermore, ultrasound may not detect May-Thurner syndrome. Although no specific guidelines exist, magnetic resonance venography can be performed in these patients for better visualization of pelvic and iliac vein anatomy. In a retrospective analysis by Osgood et al., 50 patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO underwent contrast-enhanced pelvic MRV. Out of these, four patients (8%) were found to have pelvic vein thrombosis and five patients (10%) were found to have May-Thurner syndrome [11].MTS anatomy is characterized by partial or complete impedance to the common iliac vein outflow with subsequent obstruction and thrombus formation [1]. Most of these patients are asymptomatic; however, they can have clinical manifestations secondary to thrombosis or mechanical venous occlusion. MTS can present as acute DVT, venous claudication, skin changes due to chronic venous insufficiency, or rarely pulmonary embolism. In patients with MTS, stasis of blood due to occlusion serves as a potential source of small clots that can embolize. It has been hypothesized that these clots are often too small to cause clinically significant pulmonary embolism. However, in patients with PFO, paradoxical embolism can cause a stroke or TIA [12].As mentioned before, Doppler ultrasound can miss abnormalities in iliac veins and is hence not the ideal imaging modality for the diagnosis of MTS. MRV can provide definitive evidence of May-Thurner syndrome anatomy. If MTS is associated with active thrombosis or if sequelae of chronic venous hypertension are present, these patients can be treated with angioplasty and stenting [1]. Further anatomic detailing to assist with stent deployment can be achieved with intravascular ultrasound or invasive venography.The issue of PFO closure in patients with cryptogenic stroke/TIA is controversial. Lack of ability to objectively identify paradoxical embolism as the cause of stroke/TIA and questionable efficacy of closure devices to prevent paradoxical embolism are some of the major concerns. The latest American Academy of Neurology guidelines recommend against routine PFO closure in patients with cryptogenic stroke without concomitant DVT [13]. However, these guidelines advocate consideration of PFO closure in patients with recurrent cryptogenic strokes. Furthermore, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines advocate consideration of PFO closure in patients with cryptogenic stroke who also have DVT [14]. As highlighted before, May-Thurner syndrome is a potential source of venous thromboembolism. Hence, these patients with cryptogenic stroke may benefit from PFO closure.

Carney Complex: A Rare Case of Multicentric Cardiac Myxoma Associated with Endocrinopathy

We are reporting a 21-year-old female patient with past surgical history significant for excision of a cutaneous myxoma who presented with multicentric cardiac myxomas involving the four cardiac chambers. She also presented with endocrinal disorders in the form of an enlarged right lobe of the thyroid, hyperthyroid state, and an incidentally noted adrenal cyst; hence, she was diagnosed with carney complex syndrome.Cardiac myxoma is the most common benign cardiac tumor. It usually presents as a sporadic isolated condition in the left atrium of middle-aged women [1]. A condition of multiple cardiac myxomas was reported in the familial forms. Carney complex (CNC) is one of those familial forms characterized by multiple cardiac myxomas, skin lesions, and various endocrine disorders [2].A 21-year-old female patient presented with progressive exertional dyspnea and irregular palpitations for 3 months. She had past surgical history significant for excision of a cutaneous myxoma in her left arm. Physical examination revealed a high jugular venous pressure and a diastolic murmur. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits except for a low TSH and elevated free T3 and T4. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a large echogenic mobile mass with central constriction attached to the interventricular septum (IVS), occupying the entire right atrium and right ventricle (RV) and obstructing the flow of the tricuspid valve. There were two other masses of the same echogenicity: one was occupying the left ventricle (LV) and the other was in the left atrium attached to the interatrial septum at the site of fossa ovalis (Figure 1, Videos 1–5). The left ventricular dimensions and function were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance showed similar findings with no septal invasion and tissue characterization suggestive of multiple myxomas (Figure 2). Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed the same findings (Figure 3) in addition to an enlarged thyroid nodule and a left adrenal cyst that measures 65 × 57 mm (Figure 4). Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland revealed a markedly enlarged right lobe of the thyroid with normal vascularity. Serum aldosterone, dexamethasone suppression test, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and 24-hour urine metanephrines were within normal limits.The patient underwent surgery where all three masses were excised. However, the tricuspid valve was inseparable from the RV mass; hence, it was replaced with a tissue prosthesis. The masses were grossly reddish grey in color, fleshy, and gelatinous in consistency (Figure 5). The histopathological examination of the excised masses revealed myxomatous cellular proliferations with sparse collagen fibers consistent with multiple myxomas (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)). The patient was followed up on 6-month intervals. After 2 years of follow-up, the adrenal cyst was stable in size; however, TTE showed a mass in the left ventricular outflow tract (Figures 7 and 8, Videos 6–10). The newly developed mass was surgically excised, and histopathology revealed myxomatous tissue.Primary intracardiac tumors are extremely rare in comparison to secondary tumors. However, myxoma is the most common primary cardiac neoplasm [1]. Cardiac myxoma usually presents as a sporadic mass; it can occur in any chamber of the heart but mainly occurs in the left atrium, and it affects women more than men with a mean age of 56. If myxoma presents as multiple masses, which rarely occurs, it is usually a familial form [2].Carney complex (CNC) is one of the familial forms inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. CNC is most frequently associated with mutations in the protein kinase A type I-alpha regulatory subunit gene (PRKAR1A). However, twenty-five percent of the cases occur sporadically secondary to de novo mutation [3]. CNC is characterized by multiple tumors, including cardiac and extracardiac myxomas, skin lesions, and various endocrine disorders [2].Cardiac myxomas associated with CNC are characterized by the following: occurring at a younger age, multicentric, and a higher tendency of recurrence after resection in comparison to solitary ones [2, 4]. Our patient presented with three myxomas initially and had a recurrence after 2 years in a different location.CNC-associated skin lesions can present as a spotty skin pigmentation which occurs in more than 80% of patients [5] or a cutaneous myxoma which is a benign dermal tumor present in less than 50% of patients. Cutaneous myxoma is a well-demarcated subcutaneous nodule that can reach 15 mm in diameter and most commonly affects the head, neck, and trunk. When nodules are confirmed to be myxomas histologically, the diagnosis of CNC is highly suggested [5, 6]. Hence, we would suggest screening any patient who present with cutaneous myxomas for other features of CNC. Our patient did not develop any skin pigmentation. However, she had history of a surgically removed cutaneous myxoma.Endocrine abnormalities due to tumors of the adrenal and pituitary glands or testicular tumors are the most frequent systemic manifestations of CNC. Cushing’s syndrome can occur in up to 45% of patients diagnosed with CNC [7]. Our patient had no symptoms that would suggest Cushing’s syndrome, and the adrenal gland laboratory work-up was within normal limits. However, an adrenal cyst was detected on computed tomography and was followed up for 2 years without any change in size.Thyroid disease is also common; almost 75% of patients with CNC will develop thyroid nodules typically early in life, and 25% will develop adenomatous disease. Less than 10% will develop thyroid cancer. Hence, fine-needle aspiration is indicated for patients with thyroid nodules. Regardless of the previous pathologies, most CNC patients are euthyroid [8]. Our patient presented with a nodule and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism which is uncommon.In order to diagnose CNC, Stratakis et al. defined the diagnostic criteria (Table 1). Diagnosis is established if the patient has two or more major criteria, or, alternatively, one major criterion in addition to either an inactivating mutation of the PRKAR1A gene or a first-degree relative has CNC [9, 10].Although the clinical diagnostic criteria are reliable, nowadays genetic testing for mutations in the PRKAR1A gene is more commonly used for diagnostic certainty. In addition, genetic screening of potentially affected family members of patients with CNC could be useful especially in younger family members. However, clinical surveillance is still advisable for family members even when a PRKAR1A pathogenic variant is not identified.In cases of cardiac myxomas, surgical resection is the treatment of choice with a 6-month follow-up via TTE afterwards due to the high incidence of recurrence. In addition, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended in order to screen for endocrinopathies and malignancies. Clinical surveillance is advisable for family members and possibly genetic testing. In our patient, clinical screening of the family was not significant; hence, we concluded she developed a de novo mutation.Multiple intracardiac myxomas account for less than 5% of all cases of myxoma. Its presence should warrant screening for endocrinal disorders and should be treated by complete surgical excision with a generous safety margin in addition to close follow-up as it carries high risk of recurrence.Yehia Saleh and Basma Hammad are co-first authors.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Yehia Saleh and Basma Hammad contributed equally to the development of this manuscript.Supplementary 1.

Complicated Infective Endocarditis Limited to a Chiari Network

The Chiari network is an uncommon vestigial structure of the heart that is often clinically insignificant. We present an unusual case of infective endocarditis affecting only the Chiari network in a patient who presented with septic emboli to the lungs and brain. Case summary. A 61-year-old man was admitted with a 2-month history of hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, and right upper extremity numbness and weakness. He was found to have multifocal bilateral pulmonary opacities and an abscess collection in the brain. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus intermedius and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was normal. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed an 8.3 × 4.6 mm vegetation arising from the Chiari network, close to the right atrial appendage, without involvement of the tricuspid valve or any of the other valves. There were no atrial or ventricular septal defects. He was treated with appropriate antibiotics with improvement of symptoms. Repeat imaging showed improvement of the lung opacities, but not the brain abscess, warranting transfer to another hospital for neurosurgical intervention. Conclusion. The diagnosis and management of isolated Chiari network endocarditis require a high index of clinical suspicion. A multidisciplinary approach incorporating both medical and surgical approaches where necessary is essential for optimal outcome.A 61-year-old male patient presented to the emergency room (ER) on account of a 3-month history of hemoptysis as well as a 2-week history of right upper extremity weakness and numbness.Hemoptysis was associated with pleuritic right-sided chest pain as well as orthopnea and had been previously treated with two courses of empiric antibiotics and steroids at an outside hospital without improvement prompting his presentation to our emergency room.Weakness and numbness of the right upper extremity were initially associated with a painful right palmar rash which was resolved with self-administered topical corticosteroids at home.Past medical history was significant for untreated latent tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed about forty years prior to this presentation as well as coronary artery disease requiring stent placement twice in the past.On presentation, the patient was not in acute distress but was tachycardic at 100 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of 16 cycles per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100 percent on room air. Blood pressure was 144/87 millimeters of mercury, and temperature was 99 degrees Fahrenheit.On physical examination, he was afebrile and had normal breath sounds and heart sounds without murmurs. Neurological examination was notable for reduced sensation to light but not crude touch over the right hand with reduced strength of 4/5 in that in same extremity. Laboratory studies were significant for a white blood cell count of 18,400 per microliter with 76.3 percent neutrophils, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 90 millimeters per hour, and a C-reactive protein level of 167 milligrams per liter.Imaging done on admission revealed multifocal lung opacities (Figure 1) concerning for community-acquired multifocal pneumonia (possibly secondary to a resistant organism as patient had completed courses of cefdinir and levofloxacin at the outside hospital without resolution of his symptoms). Other considerations were for possible septic emboli of undetermined source as well as reactivated pulmonary tuberculosis given his long-standing history of latent TB with multiple positive skin purified protein derivative tests in the past.CT scan of the head without contrast was concerning for a possible infarct of unclear age, and a follow-up MRI revealed possible abscess collection (Figures 2 and 3).He was initially placed on airborne isolation with empiric first-line antituberculosis agents (which were discontinued after 6 negative acid-fast bacilli sputum samples were obtained) as well as empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) for possible multifocal pneumonia, based on recommendations of the infectious disease consultants. Two blood cultures, obtained on admission, returned positive and grew Streptococcus intermedius sensitive to ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function and normal valves without regurgitations, stenosis or, vegetations.A subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed an 8.3 × 4.6 mm oscillating dumbbell-shaped vegetation arising from the Chiari network, close to the os of the right atrial appendage (Figure 4), without evidence of valvular vegetations, insufficiency, or a patent foramen ovale.A diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made based on the modified Duke criteria with two separate blood cultures positive for Streptococcus intermedius, echocardiographic findings of an oscillating intracardiac mass, consistent with a vegetation, and septic pulmonary and intracranial lesions [1]. Medical management was chosen at the time of the diagnosis of this Chiari network endocarditis with septic emboli to the lungs and brain, with plans for repeat imaging with a transesophageal echo after six weeks of appropriate antibiotic therapy.Antibiotic coverage was thus narrowed and tailored to the culprit organism with ceftriaxone, and gentamycin was added for endocarditis synergy per infectious disease team recommendations. Clinical and laboratory evidences of improvement including resolution of the hemoptysis and right upper extremity weakness as well as reduction in the white blood cell count from 18,400 per microliter on admission to 6400 per microliter and in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate from 90 millimeters per hour to 28 millimeters per hour as well as the C reactive protein from 167 milligrams per liter to 0.9 milligrams per liter were documented.Interval reduction in the size of the lung lesions but not the brain lesions was noted after four weeks of parenteral antibiotic treatment, and neurosurgical evaluation for possible evacuation of the abscess was thus recommended. The patient was transferred to an outside hospital where those services were readily available. He had an image-guided stereotactic drainage of the abscess via a left parietal burr hole, with initial gram stain of the fluid showing gram-positive cocci, but the culture had no growth after 5 days probably because the patient had been on appropriate antibiotics for four weeks prior to the drainage procedure.The patient completed six weeks of antibiotic therapy at the outside hospital and was discharged home in a stable clinical state but did not follow up as recommended.The Chiari network is a mobile, fenestrated anatomic variant seen in the right atrium of about 1.5–3% of the population [2, 3] and has been described as an embryonic remnant of the right valve of the venous sinus [4].Even though it is usually of no significance and discovered incidentally during transesophageal echocardiography for other indications or at autopsy, historical associations with some conditions such as a patent foramen ovale, with more intense right-to-left shunting than controls, atrial septal aneurysm and recurrent arterial embolic events with a cardiac source have been described in the literature [2, 3]. Infective endocarditis affecting the Chiari network is a rare finding which has been seldom described in the literature [5], and isolated involvement of the Chiari network, while sparing the other heart valves, is clearly a much rarer entity.Our patient presented with features of the complications of infective endocarditis with an initial negative TTE which was followed by a TEE, done on account of a high index of suspicion, which eventually revealed the vegetations attached solely to the Chiari network, sparing the valves on both the right and left sides of the heart. This is in contrast to many previously reported cases in which other heart valves were notably involved [5, 6], sometimes on both sides of the heart.Complications of infective endocarditis such as the multilobar lung abscesses and single brain abscess, noted in our patient, which likely occurred through hematogenous spread from the primary focus of infection on the Chiari malformation have been described in the past as well. This spread is thought to be facilitated in patients with atrial septal defects or other right-to left shunts [5] which was not demonstrated on the echocardiograms of this patient. The lack of a physically demonstrable shunt however does not preclude hematogenous spread as demonstrated in our index case.The right upper extremity palmar rash reported by the patient on admission, which was resolved with topical corticosteroids prior to presentation, was concerning for possible Osler’s nodes or Janeway lesions which are expected skin findings of a painful papular and painless macular rash, respectively, in patients with infective endocarditis. It is however difficult to make definitive comments on this as it was not present on admission. It is also unlikely for Osler’s nodes or Janeway lesions to resolve with topical corticosteroids without adequate treatment tailored to the causative agent of the infective endocarditis, as described in a similar case, where the skin manifestations we noted to have resolved within 8–10 weeks of therapy (a 12-week course of antibiotics had been planned for the patient in that case report on account of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus being the causative organism) [5]. Our patient’s blood cultures grew Streptococcus intermedius, sensitive to ceftriaxone, for which at least 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy was the recommended treatment approach.The decision for the medical versus surgical approach to the treatment of Chiari network endocarditis has no set guidelines in terms of size or extent of the vegetation; however, Payne et al. in 2003 described a surgical approach to a patient who already had another indication for cardiac surgery (three vessel disease requiring coronary artery bypass grafting) [3]. Complete resolution with medical therapy alone has also been described in a patient with Chiari network endocarditis also affecting the aortic valve [5], even though the dimensions of the vegetation on the Chiari network in that report were much larger, (28 × 8 mm) compared to those of our patient (8.3 × 4.6 mm).A medical approach was thus prudent, with plans to reevaluate with interval imaging of the abscesses and also a repeat TEE upon completion of the 6-week course of recommended antibiotics. This is consistent with the 2015 American Heart Association (AHA) 2015 Scientific Statement on infective endocarditis management in adults which stated that repeat echocardiography at the time of antimicrobial therapy completion was a class IIa recommendation with evidence level C (meaning that it was based partly on divergent expert opinion, and additional studies with focused objectives were needed to support this practice) [1].Our patient’s case is unique in the fact that he presented with features of the complications, which were later tied together by the definitive diagnosis. Medical management of the Chiari network endocarditis with antibiotics resulted in clinical improvement, reduction in the size of the lung lesions, and resolution of the right upper extremity weakness. The persistent brain abscesses required neurosurgical evacuation which the patient received at an outside hospital.In future cases with infective endocarditis affecting the Chiari network, either alone or in conjunction with other heart valves, a medical approach to treatment can be explored, while monitoring with appropriate imaging modalities, for the resolution of the vegetation itself and also that of any sites of complications from septic emboli. Complications from septic emboli, as seen in our patient, may warrant widening of the multidisciplinary approach to the care of these patients to involve the possibility of interventions to mitigate these complications.This manuscript is based on a poster presented at the American College of Physicians (ACP) Tennessee Chapter meeting in October 2017. It was chosen as the best poster at that meeting and was presented at the National ACP meeting, between April 18 and 21 2018.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Rare Cause of Late Recurrent Angina following Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: Iatrogenic Aortocoronary Arteriovenous Fistula Causing Coronary Steal
1Department of Internal Medicine, John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, IL 60612, USA2Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, IL 60612, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Jayakumar Sreenivasan; moc.liamg@101sramukayajReceived 10 February 2018; Revised 19 April 2018; Accepted 2 May 2018; Published 24 June 2018Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2018 Jayakumar Sreenivasan et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Iatrogenic aortocoronary arteriovenous fistula is a very rare complication of coronary artery bypass grafting in which one of the arterial grafts inadvertently forms a fistulous tract with a cardiac vein, shunting blood from the anastomosed coronary artery. We report a patient with an iatrogenic left internal mammary artery graft to cardiac vein fistula presenting with recurrent angina three years after a three-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting.This case of iatrogenic aortocoronary arteriovenous fistula (ACAVF) is interesting because it is a rare but important complication of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) which can result in significant clinical consequences like heart failure, tamponade, and death. To the best of our knowledge, only 38 similar cases of ACAVF have been reported in the literature. We have included a brief review of the literature on this rare complication and the various available treatment options.A 61-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia initially presented with unstable angina; a regadenoson stress nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) revealed anterolateral wall ischemia. Subsequent coronary angiography demonstrated severe stenoses of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery. She underwent CABG with a left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft to the LAD artery and saphenous venous grafts (SVG) to the right posterior descending (RPDA) and obtuse marginal 4 (OM4) arteries. After CABG, the patient was doing well on guideline-directed medical therapy. Three years later, she presented with acute onset of chest pain suggestive of unstable angina. On admission, her heart rate was 80/min, blood pressure was 140/86 mmHg, and her physical exam was unremarkable.Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without any evidence of ischemia. Serially monitored cardiac enzymes were within normal limits, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal ejection fraction with no distinct regional wall motion abnormalities. Regadenoson stress nuclear MPI showed anterolateral ischemia, a territory which should have been supplied by the LIMA to LAD graft. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed known severe native, three-vessel coronary artery disease. The native LAD vessel was very small. Proximal LAD was medium sized. Mid LAD had 100% stenosis at the origin of diagonal branch. Distal LAD was not visualized (Figure 1 and Video 1). Graft angiography was significant for a very large tortuous LIMA graft with poor visualization of the LAD artery after touchdown (Figure 2 and Video 2). Upon contrast injection of the LIMA graft, there was immediate opacification of the coronary sinus suggesting a fistulous tract between the LIMA graft and a cardiac vein (Figure 2 and Video 1). SVG grafts to the RPDA and OM4 arteries were patent. Cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CTA) confirmed the cardiac catheterization findings of a LIMA graft to coronary sinus fistula (Figure 3).The case was discussed with the cardiac surgical team as well as in a multicenter interventional conference to explore both surgical and percutaneous options. A percutaneous approach of coiling of the fistula is anatomically complex; a surgical approach which would involve ligation of ACAVF and redo CABG, would put the patient at higher risk of perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality. Because of the coronary arterio-venous fistula with steal, it was unclear whether revascularization of the native LAD would be of any significant benefit to the patient. After full discussion about the risks versus benefits of treatment options with the heart team, the patient elected for medical management and intervention only if she has escalating symptoms. The patient's anti-anginal therapy was optimized with Metoprolol 50 mg daily, which she tolerated well with gradual improvement in her exercise tolerance and resolution of her anginal symptoms. The patient is currently asymptomatic at 1 year follow-up. Repeat cardiac stress testing may be pursued if she has recurrent symptoms. The tentative plan is to offer her interventional coil closure or surgical closure of the ACAVF if she has recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms.Iatrogenic ACAVF is a rare complication of CABG causing significant morbidity. To the best of our knowledge, only 38 cases have been reported [1]. ACAVF can become symptomatic over the course of time. The most common presentation is angina due to coronary steal phenomenon involving the affected coronary artery [2]. Other less commonly reported potential outcomes are high output heart failure as a sequela of chronic arteriovenous fistula and rupture leading to cardiac tamponade [2–4]. The LAD is the most commonly involved artery, representing 60% of cases of iatrogenic ACAVF following CABG [2]. Possible risk factors for development of post-CABG iatrogenic ACAVF are myocardial fibrosis from prior infarction or cardiac surgery as well as a LAD artery deeply embedded in thick epicardial fat which makes it surgically challenging to separate it from the adjacent great cardiac vein [2, 3]. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are the best available noninvasive imaging modalities for visualization of ACAVF [5, 6]. Cardiac catheterization with graft angiography is the best testing modality for the diagnosis of ACAVF. The appearance on angiography is a very large caliber LIMA which has undergone hypermaturation due to it being connected to a low-pressure venous system. As of now, there are no robust evidence-based data to help guide treatment for patients with ACAVF. Management of ACAVF depends on the presentation and symptomatology of the patients. Spontaneous closure of ACAVF in two asymptomatic patients has been reported so far [7]. Hence, conservative therapy is preferred for asymptomatic patients and patients with a good response to optimal medical treatment of angina as like in our case [2]. Our case is the third in literature for conservative medical management of ACAVF. We think medical management of ACAVF should include anti-anginal therapy particularly, a beta blocker in line with medical therapy for stable coronary artery disease until we have further prospective investigations for this unique clinical scenario. Patients who are persistently symptomatic due to ACAVF despite optimal medical therapy have primarily been treated with surgical ligation of the fistula and bypassing the diseased coronary artery [3]. With current advancements in innovative percutaneous techniques, coil or balloon embolization of the fistula and stenting of the unbypassed artery are the promising alternative treatment options over surgical approaches [8–13].Written explicit consent was obtained from the patient by the corresponding author for reporting and publication of all case details including imaging and follow-up data. Consent forms are available if requested by editorial team.Abstract of the case was presented as a challenging case in Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) 2017 Annual Conference held in Denver, CO.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Supplementary 1.

A Rare Presentation of Cardiac Tamponade from Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder
Department of Internal Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, 9200 W. Wisconsin Ave., Suite 5100, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Sowmya Palam; ude.wcm@malapsReceived 1 April 2018; Accepted 30 May 2018; Published 19 June 2018Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2018 Sowmya Palam et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 62-year-old man presented with 2 weeks of progressive dyspnea and chest pain. He was previously diagnosed with high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder and underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy 10 months earlier, resulting in pathologic complete remission. Clinical evaluation and echocardiographic imaging was consistent with a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. Due to a history of malignancy, the patient was referred for a surgical pericardial window, to include biopsy of the pericardium. Pericardial fluid and pericardial biopsy specimens were consistent with metastatic UC. Cardiac tamponade due to metastatic UC is a rare presentation, and, to our knowledge, there have been only 5 cases reported in the English literature. We report a rare case of cardiac tamponade due to isolated pericardial metastases from high grade UC of the bladder and discuss the symptoms, treatment, and prognosis of this pathologic condition. We also present a brief review of previously published literature. Through this discussion, we would like to emphasize the (1) consideration of cardiac metastases in the differential diagnosis for patients with a history of UC presenting with cardiac or pulmonary symptoms and (2) improved diagnostics with pericardial biopsy and pericardiocentesis over pericardiocentesis alone.Bladder cancer is the ninth most common malignancy worldwide involving the urinary system. Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is the most prevalent histologic type in the United States and Western Europe and accounts for approximately 90% of bladder cancers [1, 2]. Common sites of metastasis of UC include regional and distant lymph nodes, liver, lung, and bone [3]. However, in rare cases, metastasis to the pericardium can also be seen. Approximately ten percent of autopsied cases of UC have shown cardiac metastasis [4]. However, in most cases, the metastases are clinically silent. We report a rare case of cardiac tamponade caused by metastatic UC of the bladder and discuss the patient’s symptoms, management, and prognosis.A 62-year-old man presented with 2 weeks of progressive dyspnea and chest pain. He was previously diagnosed with high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder. He underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy, resulting in complete pathologic remission. On examination, patient was afebrile with a heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure of 122/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and O2 saturation of 98% on room air. Heart sounds were muffled. Heart rhythm was irregularly irregular. Distention of the jugular veins was observed and Kussmaul’s sign was present. Although pulsus paradoxus was not observed, other physical findings were extremely concerning for cardiac tamponade. Bibasilar crackles were present on lung auscultation. Laboratory data was remarkable for a creatinine of 1.42 (baseline of 1.08) and international normalized ratio (INR) of 3.6 (on warfarin for a history of pulmonary embolism). His complete blood counts and electrolytes were normal. His electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and electrical alternans. Chest radiograph showed enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.Due to high clinical suspicion for cardiac tamponade, a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was obtained which showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right ventricle, suggestive of cardiac tamponade, as well as mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction (see Figures 1 and 2). Patient’s INR was reversed to <1.5 and he underwent emergent subxiphoid pericardial window with the removal of 700 ml of turbid, dark, bloody pericardial fluid. He had significant improvement in hemodynamics and respiratory distress. The pericardial fluid cytology and pericardial biopsy were both positive for malignancy, consistent with metastatic UC (see Figure 3).One week after the pericardial window, the patient underwent a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis which did not show evidence of metastatic disease elsewhere. Given the recurrence of UC with metastasis to the pericardium, he was started on atezolizumab. Subsequently, he was noted to have recurrent pericardial effusion suggesting failure of treatment (see Figure 4). He was then started on pemetrexed, a folate antimetabolite chemotherapy drug, for metastatic UC with plans to complete 6 cycles.Metastases to the heart typically occur late in the course of malignant disease. The incidence of cardiac metastasis, regardless of primary, has been estimated from 2.3% to 18.3% [5]. The pericardium is involved in about two thirds of all cardiac metastasis. Bussani et al. reported a large autopsy case series of 18,751 in-hospital deceased patients and found one or more malignant neoplasms in 7289 patients. The incidence of cardiac metastasis diagnosed postmortem was 9.1% and the tumors leading to the highest rates of cardiac metastasis were pleural mesothelioma (48.4%), melanoma (27.8%), lung adenocarcinoma (21%), undifferentiated carcinomas (19.5%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (18.2%), and breast carcinoma (15.5%). In contrast, only 3.9% of autopsied cases of UC revealed cardiac metastases.To the best of our knowledge after a review of the literature, there have been only five cases of cardiac tamponade due to metastatic UC, with our case being the sixth [6–10]. In four of these cases, patients presented with symptoms of dyspnea, cough, fatigue, orthopnea, and chest pain [7–10]. In all cases, a chest radiograph showed the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. An echocardiogram was utilized to evaluate the extent of pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis was performed for drainage and sent for cytology in all cases. However, in three of the cases, the pericardial fluid cytodiagnosis was equivocal and a pericardial biopsy was also obtained which led to the diagnosis of metastasis from UC [6, 8, 10]. In one case, the cytology was negative and no pericardial biopsy was performed; however, a large echogenic mass abutting the proximal free wall of the left ventricle and extending into the base of the pericardial cavity was noted [9]. In our case, pursuing a surgical approach for the pericardial window allowed us to obtain a pericardial biopsy in addition to pericardial fluid analysis in a patient with a prior history of malignancy. Both the pericardial fluid and pericardial biopsy showed malignant cells, which helped us establish the diagnosis of metastasis UC and guide appropriate management for the patient.Of note, a minimum of 60 ml of pericardial fluid is necessary to ensure that benign diagnosis is truly benign and improves the likelihood of detecting malignancy with a sensitivity of 91.7%–92.1% [11, 12]. The false negative rates of cytology and biopsy range from 4% to 14.7% and 40% to 54.5%, respectively [13–15]. However, combining pericardial biopsy with pericardial effusion cytology further increases overall sensitivity for identifying malignancy by approximately 8% [9]. In this case, performing the surgical approach for the window allowed us to not only obtain a pericardial biopsy but also decompress the pericardial effusion and provide immediate restoration of improved hemodynamics and help prevent immediate recurrence of the pericardial effusion. Therefore, in patients with a history of malignancy, this approach should be considered.Systemic chemotherapy is the standard approach for the initial treatment of patients with metastatic UC. However, the optimum management of UC with cardiac metastasis remains unclear at this time. In case of symptomatic cardiac metastases, the prognosis is extremely poor. Hattori et al., in their review of 14 reported cases in the literature found that most patients died within one year after diagnosis of symptomatic cardiac metastases from UC [7].In patients with a history of malignancy who present with clinical, ECG, or CXR findings concerning pericardial effusion, one must consider a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, particularly in a hemodynamically unstable patient. Cardiac metastasis should be on the differential diagnosis as an etiology. An echocardiogram may be performed for confirmation. However, if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, we recommend emergent pericardiocentesis, preferably with pericardial biopsy via surgical approach for accurate and early diagnosis of cardiac metastasis and for rapid relief of hemodynamic compromise. Treatment options for metastatic UC include systemic chemotherapy; however, prognosis of symptomatic cardiac metastasis from UC remains extremely poor.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
A Young Male with Severe Myocarditis and Skeletal Muscle Myositis
1Cardiology Department, University Hospital Limerick, St. Nessan's Road, Dooradoyle, Limerick, Ireland2Rheumatology Department, University Hospital Limerick, St Nessan's Road, Dooradoyle, Limerick, IrelandCorrespondence should be addressed to Abdalla Ibrahim; moc.liamg@dmmiharbi.alladbaReceived 2 March 2018; Revised 12 May 2018; Accepted 28 May 2018; Published 14 June 2018Academic Editor: Domingo A. Pascual-FigalCopyright © 2018 Abdalla Ibrahim et al.

He had elevated troponin T, normal skeletal muscle enzymes, and negative inflammatory markers. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed active myocarditis with extensive myocardial fibrosis and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). His myocarditis symptoms resolved with steroids and anti-inflammatory treatment, but on closer questioning, he reported a vague history of long-standing calf discomfort associated with episodes of stiffness, fatigue, and flu-like symptoms. MRI of the lower legs consequently demonstrated active myositis in the calf muscles. Immunomodulatory therapy was commenced with good effect. The patient is undergoing regular follow-up in both cardiology and rheumatology outpatient departments. Repeated MRI of the legs showed significant interval improvement in his skeletal muscle myositis, and repeat cardiac MRI demonstrated the resolution of myocarditis along with persistent stable extensive myocardial fibrosis and preserved LVEF. The patient has returned to full-time work.The diagnosis of myocarditis remains challenging given the diverse nature of clinical presentations [1]. The exact incidence is difficult to determine since endomyocardial biopsy, the gold standard diagnostic test, is used infrequently [2]. It has been reported that as few as 10% of people with polymyositis present with a cardiac involvement as the initial feature of the disease compared to 70% of patients with known polymyositis who experience some cardiac involvement as their disease progresses [3]. Clinically significant cardiac involvement has rarely been reported in myositis patients [4], while subclinical manifestations more commonly present as conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias detected on electrocardiography (ECG) [5].A 34-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with recurrent episodes of retrosternal chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath with an elevated troponin T. He had suffered an acute episode of myocarditis four years previously requiring hospital admission. He had no other relevant medical history and no family history of cardiac disease. He is a nonsmoker and consumed alcohol occasionally. Clinical examination was unremarkable and did not show any evidence of heart failure or systemic disease. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm without any ischemic changes, and chest X-ray showed no evidence of infection or heart failure. Routine blood tests including antinuclear antibody, creatinine kinase (CK), rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein were all within normal limits apart from an elevated cardiac troponin T with a peak value of 2700 ng/l (<14 ng/l). Further extensive inflammatory, viral, and autoimmune screening was carried out and found to be negative. Subsequent coronary angiogram showed normal coronary arteries, and transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >55% with trace mitral regurgitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive subepicardial and midwall late enhancement typical of myocarditis in the anterior, lateral, and inferior walls along with extensive fibrosis with normal LVEF (Figure 1).A short course of steroids and anti-inflammatory medication as an inpatient resulted in the resolution of his myocarditis symptoms. The troponin T level normalized and the patient was discharged with a plan to repeat cardiac MRI in six months. On follow-up as an outpatient, it was decided to refer the patient to rheumatology for an opinion regarding ongoing immunomodulatory therapy. At this juncture, the patient stated that he also had symptoms of stiffness and aching in his calf muscles for quite some time but he did not consider it to be relevant. Despite persistently normal skeletal muscle enzyme levels, an MRI of the lower legs was performed and this showed active myositis involving the gastrocnemius muscles bilaterally (Figure 2). As the patient was demonstrated to have ongoing myositis despite minimal symptoms, and as he had accrued significant myocardial scarring from previous episodes of myocarditis, it was decided to commence long-term immunomodulatory therapy in the form of methotrexate and prednisolone. Clinically, the patient reported a significant improvement in his symptoms and a repeat of the lower limb MRI demonstrated a significant interval improvement in his skeletal muscle myositis. Six months later, a repeat of the cardiac MRI demonstrated resolution of myocarditis along with persistent, stable, and extensive myocardial fibrosis and preserved LVEF (Figure 3). The patient is tolerating the immunomodulatory therapy well without major side effects, and he has returned to full-time work.We describe an elusive case of a young male with recurrent episodes of acute myocarditis presenting with chest pain and elevated troponin T. All biochemical, immune, and autoimmune tests were within normal limits. However, he described a long-standing and persistent history of calf aching and discomfort. Consequently, lower limb MRI revealed that the patient had active myositis of his gastrocnemius muscles. This unexpected finding demonstrated that this inflammatory myositis was not isolated to cardiac muscle and by definition was still active despite initial treatment. As this patient had already accrued significant myocardial scarring, the finding of active myositis demonstrated the need for more effective long-term immunomodulatory therapy in order to preserve cardiac function. Cardiac involvement in patients with skeletal myositis was first reported in 1899 [6]. Subclinical conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias discovered by ECG are considered to be more frequent than clinically manifest heart involvement [5]. The number of reported cases of clinically overt cardiac involvement in patients with myositis has increased recently, largely due to the increased use of noninvasive sensitive tests such as troponin [5]. The overall incidence of heart involvement in myositis patients ranges from 6% to 75% depending on the type (clinical or subclinical), definition of cardiac involvement, and tests used to confirm the diagnosis [3, 7]. Cardiovascular involvement is considered to be one of the major causes of mortality in patients with myositis [8, 9]. Mortality due to myocardial infarction in patients with myositis was reported to be increased by 16 times, especially among female patients [10]. Despite the lack of large epidemiological studies, cardiac involvement has been reported as a cause of death in 10–20% of patients with polymyositis [11, 12]. A number of cases of cardiac and skeletal myositis have been reported in the literature in which an underlying cause was identified. Kerr and Spiera reported six cases of myocarditis as a complication in scleroderma patients with myositis. In contrast to our patient, all of the six patients had an elevated CK, and five of them had reduced LVEF [13]. Infectious agents such as influenza virus and toxoplasma have been reported to cause polymyositis and myocarditis in a 4-year-old and a 13-year-old immunocompetent patient, respectively [14, 15]. Greaves et al. investigated the prevalence of myocarditis and skeletal myositis using CK, CK-MB, and troponin I/T in 152 adults with acute viral infection. The study showed that skeletal muscle injury was far more common than cardiac muscle injury in that cohort of patients [16]. Further literature review revealed a recently reported case of myocarditis and skeletal myositis in a 65-year-old following a seasonal influenza vaccination. Similar to our case, his myocarditis was diagnosed with cardiac MRI and an elevated troponin I, but in contrast to our case, his CK level was markedly elevated [17].Our case is unique as there was no evidence from the history, clinical examination, or extensive laboratory investigations to indicate a specific aetiology of this man’s myositis. Endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard test for myocarditis; however, the clinical presentation in conjunction with the raised troponin level and a cardiac MRI demonstrating myocardial muscle oedema in keeping with myocarditis was considered sufficient to make a diagnosis without a myocardial biopsy, since such a procedure would be invasive and not without significant side effects. Consequently, the patient was noted to have calf muscle symptoms and MRI demonstrated skeletal muscle oedema in a distribution in keeping with skeletal muscle myositis. At this juncture, a skeletal muscle biopsy was proposed but the patient was not happy to consent to this procedure. However, in light of the history and clinical and MRI findings, it was considered reasonable to make a diagnosis of skeletal muscle myositis on a background of myocarditis and to treat the patient accordingly.The first-line treatment of idiopathic inflammatory myositis is a high dose of corticosteroids (60–100 mg), which should be tapered after 4–6 weeks according to response [18]. Most patients require an additional immunosuppressive agent such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil [18]. There are very few studies comparing immunosuppressant regimes (azathioprine with methotrexate, cyclosporine with methotrexate, and intramuscular methotrexate with oral methotrexate plus azathioprine). They showed no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the treatment regimes [19]. We chose methotrexate due to our extensive experience with the drug and the fact that no trials have shown the superiority of one agent over the other. Other treatment options such as intravenous immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab can be used but are reserved for severe or refractory cases [18].In conclusion, we report a rare case of clinically significant cardiac and skeletal myositis whose cause is unclear. In patients with acute myocarditis, it is important to consider the possibility of an associated skeletal myositis when suggestive symptoms are present. MRI can be useful to establish the diagnosis particularly if laboratory tests are not conclusive. Further trials are needed to determine whether cardiac involvement is associated with certain types and subtypes of myositis or not.All authors state that they have no conflicts of interest to declare.
Secret Sarcoma: A Cardiac Mass Disguised as Influenza
University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Christopher DeZorzi; ude.awoiu@izrozed-rehpotsirhcReceived 15 March 2018; Accepted 24 April 2018; Published 6 June 2018Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2018 Christopher DeZorzi and Katherine I. Harris.

The patient initially presented with symptoms consistent with influenza, but when orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion developed, these cardiac symptoms continued to be attributed to a postviral syndrome and were not further evaluated. Premature closure bias contributed to a delay in diagnosing a rare cardiac condition. The diagnostic momentum, or the continuing of a diagnostic label, occurred across multiple providers and settings. This case demonstrates the risk of premature closure and diagnostic momentum and reminds clinicians to reframe the differential diagnosis as more information on history or physical exam becomes available.A cardiac sarcoma is a rare malignant cardiac tumor that can present with nonspecific symptoms (similar to most cancers) in combination with clinical signs of heart failure due to the mass effect of the tumor. Timely diagnosis is crucial to prevent further obstruction as the tumor grows. If the tumor is recognized in the earlier stages, complications including heart failure, arrhythmias possibly leading to sudden cardiac death, and ischemia secondary to obstruction of coronary arteries can be avoided. Additionally, early detection can allow treatment before the cancer can metastasize.A 50-year-old Asian male with a past medical history of supraventricular tachycardia and obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP at night presented with one month of intermittent flu-like symptoms, orthopnea, and dyspnea on exertion. At the onset of these symptoms, he presented to a walk-in clinic and was diagnosed with influenza. He was treated symptomatically and noted improvement, but one week later he had a recurrence of symptoms while playing volleyball. From that time on, he noticed dyspnea on exertion, continued malaise, fevers, and diffuse joint pains so he presented multiple times to outpatient providers. He received doxycycline without improvement, and follow-up testing showed a mild leukocytosis, negative EBV, and an unremarkable chest X-ray. He was diagnosed with lingering postviral symptoms from influenza. He ultimately presented as a walk-in patient to the cardiology clinic when he started having chest tightness, palpitations, and his dyspnea progressed to occurring at rest, relieved only with a tripod position.EKG on presentation (Figure 1) showed right axis deviation and abnormal ST-T wave segments in V1 through V3 which was new compared with a prior EKG. Due to the concern for pulmonary embolism, a CT angiogram of the chest was obtained which displayed moderate bilateral pleural effusions, a mass in the right ventricle, and a mass in the left atrium extending through the mitral valve invading into the left ventricle (Figure 2). Echocardiogram exhibited normal LVEF but some mitral valve occlusion due to the mass. Cardiac MRI was obtained (Figure 3) and confirmed the masses. The patient required debulking of the left atrial tumor, and pathology revealed an undifferentiated, high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma. Due to tumor infiltration into the left pulmonary veins, as well as focal areas of uptake in the small bowel at a site of intussusception, he was started on pembrolizumab chemotherapy with concurrent radiation therapy to the heart and small bowel.A cardiac sarcoma is a primary malignant cardiac tumor. These are exceedingly rare, with the incidence of primary neoplasms of the heart found at autopsy being 0.017%–0.056% [1, 3]. Of these rare primary cardiac tumors, up to 75% are benign and are usually myxomas, lipomas, or rhabdomyomas. Only 25% of primary cardiac tumors are malignant and, of these, 75% are sarcomas [4]. Tumors presenting in the heart are more frequently secondary tumors than primary. The incidence of secondary tumors is 1.23% with the three most common malignant neoplasms to the heart being from lung cancer, esophageal carcinoma, and lymphoma. Risks of a cardiac sarcoma include malignant spread and physiologic effects on the heart including compression of the coronary arteries or pericardial space, arrhythmias, and outflow obstruction. Sudden death is associated with primary neoplasms approximately 0.0025% of the time. Although 86% of these were classified as benign, their locations within the heart lead to conductive and hemodynamic abnormalities resulting in sudden death [2]. In previous studies, most patients with a cardiac sarcoma were dead within one year of their diagnoses [5] and had a median survival time of 6 months [6]. In a newer study, patients who underwent resection with curative intent and survived surgery (surgical mortality was 7.4%), the median survival was 23.5 months [8]. Nonsurgical options for treatment of cardiac sarcomas can be difficult due to radiation effects on the surrounding heart and the high levels of radiation (6000–6500 cGy) that is typically needed. Also, chemotherapy effective against sarcomas, such as Adriamycin, is typically avoided due to its cardiotoxic side effect profile [7].The epidemiology indicates the rarity of this case, but the importance of recognizing this presentation in an outpatient setting before it progresses should not be lost. Beyond adding to the differential diagnoses of a patient presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion, this case reinforces the importance of reframing the diagnosis when seeing a patient multiple times within a short timeframe. This patient was seen four times within a month by a combination of outpatient providers. Premature diagnostic closure bias creates difficulties for busy practitioners to reassess a case and develop a new differential when the previous diagnosis no longer applies. Our patient had a viral-like illness at the onset, but persistent symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea should prompt a cardiac workup. An EKG showing right axis deviation and ST-T wave changes may have alerted practitioners that further workup is needed, and an echocardiogram or CT angiogram would have discovered the rare underlying diagnosis and allowed for expedited diagnosis and treatment.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
A Rare Case of Complete Heart Block in a Young Patient
1Internal Medicine Department, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Permian Basin, Odessa, TX, USA2Cardiology Department, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Zakaria Hindi; moc.liamtoh@idnihz.rdReceived 5 March 2018; Accepted 26 April 2018; Published 6 June 2018Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2018 Zakaria Hindi et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Introduction. Complete heart block (CHB) is considered as one of the dangerous rhythms since it can progress to lethal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia. It can be congenital or acquired. Patients may present with frequent palpitations, presyncope, dyspnea, or chest pain but also may remain asymptomatic. Extensive work-up should be conducted to exclude secondary causes such as infections, cardiac ischemia or myopathies, autoimmune diseases, or endocrinological diseases. In our paper, we would like to present a case of CHB in the setting of aortic abdominal thrombus that nearly occluded both renal arteries. The CHB in this case is thought to be caused by hypertensive cardiomyopathy due to ongoing uncontrolled hypertension, which is caused by bilateral renal artery stenosis. Case Presentation. A 31-year-old male with history of active smoking was incidentally found to have high blood pressure, bradycardia, and CHB on electrocardiogram. The patient was admitted to a cardiology ward and extensive work-up revealed hypokinesia of the left ventricle with low ejection fraction and left ventricle concentric hypertrophy, large abdominal aortic thrombus with bilateral renal artery stenosis, and evidence of arterial collateral connections, which suggest chronicity. The patient then was placed on four antihypertensive medications but eventually, he underwent bilateral renal artery stenting and insertion of permanent pacemaker for his CHB. The patient’s blood pressure then was under control with only one medication, and subsequent CT angiogram showed no evidence of stenosis of both renal arteries. Conclusion. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to hypertensive cardiomyopathy, which in turn can cause conduction abnormalities such as CHB. Although hypertension can be secondary to a treatable underlying cause, permanent pacemaker is essential to treat CHB.Complete heart block (CHB) is considered as one of the dangerous rhythms since it can progress to lethal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia. It can be congenital or secondary to infections, cardiac ischemia or myopathies, autoimmune diseases, or endocrinological diseases that require extensive work-up to be ruled out [1]. Out of secondary causes, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and infiltrative myopathies such as sarcoidosis and amyloidosis are considered as potential causes for CHB [2].Taking hypertensive heart disease into consideration, the condition is quite similar to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In that, both conditions have similar findings on physical exam and echocardiogram. They can be differentiated however on the basis of strain rate imaging [3]. Although the establishment of relation between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and CHB has been reported before [4], yet the association between hypertensive cardiomyopathy and CHB has never been reported. Hence, we would like to report a case of CHB in a patient with bilateral renal artery stenosis, nonpreserved nonischemic hypertensive cardiomyopathy, and uncontrolled hypertension. We believe that this case would merit further investigation regarding the relation between hypertensive cardiomyopathy and CHB.A 30-year-old male with history of active smoking (1 pack per day for 10 years) and external hemorrhoids came to the preop anesthesia clinic for anesthesia evaluation fitness and was found to have high blood pressure (BP) (234/144). He was referred immediately to the emergency room (ER) for BP control. In the ER, BP was 221/125 and heart rate (HR) was 50 beats/minute. Routine electrocardiogram (EKG) showed 3rd-degree heart block (TDHB) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with strain pattern (Figure 1). He denied chest pain, palpitation, dyspnea, dizziness, or syncope. The patient was started on antihypertensive medication for BP control and was admitted to the cardiology ward for evaluation and management of complete heart block. Further physical exam revealed absent arterial pulses except the left radial pulse which was weak. BP was significantly different between both upper limbs and between upper and lower limbs (right upper limb 126/86 and lower limb 85/54, left upper limb 145/85 and lower limb 75/50). His initial blood work showed mild renal impairment.Computerized tomography (CT) thoracic aortogram was done to rule out coarctation of the aorta, which was normal; CT coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart was normal as well. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed moderate hypokinesia of the left ventricle (LV), ejection fraction (EF) 35–40%, grade 2/4 diastolic dysfunction, and moderate concentric LVH. Holter monitoring did not reveal any pauses. Ultrasound/Doppler of the kidneys showed increased parenchymal echogenicity with poorly defined corticomedullary junction impressive of renal parenchymal disease. CT abdominal aortogram showed large thrombus seen in the abdominal aorta starting at the level of renal arteries completely occluding the aorta and common iliac arteries with no blood flow seen beyond the renal artery level up to the aortic bifurcation; moderate to severe stenosis is noted at the origin of both renal arteries because of thrombus (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Multiple abdominal collaterals are seen with multiple collaterals in the anterior and lateral abdominal wall and paraspinal collaterals (Figure 3). Extensive blood work-up including thyroid function test and autoimmune and thrombophilia work-up was all unremarkable. No cause of aortic thrombosis and TDHB was identified.Initial recommendation of the vascular surgeon was to follow up in the clinic with no intervention as it is a chronic process, and the patient was asymptomatic. Since the patient had uncontrolled hypertension despite being on maximum doses of four antihypertensive medications, eventually he underwent percutaneous stenting of bilateral renal arteries which was followed by an improvement in the BP and renal function and reduction in doses of antihypertensive medications. The patient also underwent permanent pacemaker insertion for TDHB. The patient was also placed on warfarin and was advised to see the vascular surgeon after 3 months. Unfortunately, the patient did not follow up.This young patient had accidental findings of asymptomatic CHB, uncontrolled HTN with renal artery stenosis, and complete thrombosis of the abdominal aorta. After reviewing the literature, we could not find a unifying diagnosis for the patient’s condition. The closest condition to our patient’s presentation is Leriche’s that is described as an aortoiliac disease, which partially explains the patient’s thrombotic events [5]. Yet, Leriche’s syndrome has no known association with CHB. We believe that the patient had initially bilateral renal artery stenosis which was a consequence of the chronic abdominal aortic thrombus as there were collateral arteries. The uncontrolled HTN which resulted from untreated bilateral renal artery stenosis led to hypertensive heart disease that was evident by EKG and echocardiogram findings.Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) is a group of abnormalities that comprises LVH and systolic/diastolic dysfunction. HHD in general is considered as a risk factor for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia. Bradyarrhythmias, however, are mainly caused by drug side effects (such as beta blockers) when treating HTN [6–8]. The pathogenesis of arrhythmias in HHD arises mainly from LVH and left ventricular dysfunction [9]. Both may be associated with CHB if ischemic cardiomyopathy develops [10]. In our patient, ischemic cardiomyopathy was ruled out by coronary angiogram. This can indicate that HHD may cause atrioventricular block without developing ischemia.The management of our patient was based on controlling HTN sufficiently. Our target blood pressure was below 130/80 mmHg. Despite medicating the patient with maximum doses of four different antihypertensive agents (which fits the definition of resistant HTN [11]), his blood pressure was not controlled. The stenting of both renal arteries was done as per American Heart Association recommendations [11]. As for CHB, the treatment of choice is permanent pacemaker regardless of the symptoms [12, 13].It should be emphasized that CHB may be a rare consequence in HHD which requires permanent pacemaker regardless of cardiomyopathy stage or severity of symptoms. Moreover, the relation between CHB and HHD should be investigated.Informed consent has been obtained from the patient.The authors have no conflict of interests regarding publishing of this paper.
Endocarditis Caused by Gram-Negative Moraxella osloensis in an Immunocompetent Patient: First Case Report in Latin America

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.This is a case report of infective endocarditis due to Moraxella osloensis. This study would be the fourth since the two latest episodes were described in 2015. The patient of this exposition is different from those previously described in the literature because it was a young adult, under 50 years of age, immunocompetent, with no comorbidities and no obvious focus of infection.The genus Moraxella consists of aerobic gram-negative coccobacilli, and it was first described in 1967. However, few rare cases have been reported in the literature since then [1, 2]. The natural habitat of Moraxella osloensis and its clinical significance in infections are much less studied due to rare individual reports. However, it has been observed in healthy adults’ nasopharynx [3, 4], and in outpatients’ ear, nose [5] and throat [1]. The infections caused by M. osloensis include infective endocarditis (IE), meningitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, vaginitis, subclinical sinusitis [6] and bacteremia [7], which does not usually occur alone.The 41-year-old male patient F.C.F. showed no comorbidities and denied alcoholism, smoking, and taking regular medication. He started having fever, myalgia, anorexia, vomiting, jaundice, and colure on July 14, 2016. He took antiviral drugs with monohydrate dipyrone (750 mg/day) associated to chlorpheniramine maleate (6 mg/day) and paracetamol (>4 g/day) at his peril. He denied taking any other drugs on that occasion. Because his clinical condition had not improved, he went to the hospital, where he underwent medical tests such as complete blood count (CBC): hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL, hematocrit 39.6%, platelets 343,000/mm3, white blood cells (leucocytes 5200/mm3), liver function Aspartate transaminase (AST) 39.8 U/L, Alanine transaminase (ALT) 40.1 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 346 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 98.5 U/L. In addition, the NS1 test for dengue was negative and the abdominal ultrasound showed the liver with diffuse increase in parenchymal echogenicity, indicating mild/moderate steatosis. The patient was diagnosed with hepatitis due to the clinical signs assessed, results of laboratory tests, and excessive intake of paracetamol. The patient was hospitalized, and after 4 days of intravenous hydration and clinical assessment, he was discharged from the hospital.Fifteen days after his discharge, the patient related that he had daily high fever, appetite loss, sweating, weight loss (8 kg), and progressive worsening. On August 6, 2016, the infectious disease specialist ordered new medical tests when examining the patient. The results revealed that blood count was hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL; hematocrit 30.7%; red blood cells 4.16 million/mm3; and platelets 200,000/mm3. It also revealed anisocytosis, microcytosis, and hypochromia; white blood cells were leucocytes 9700/mm3, banded neutrophils 6%, segmented neutrophils 76%, and lymphocytes 10%. Liver function tests indicated aspartate transaminase (AST) 64 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 85 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 560 U/L, and lactic dehydrogenase 248 U/L. C-reactive protein was 134.29 mg/L. Serologies were ordered for leptospirosis, rickettsialpox, hepatitis, syphilis, Zika virus, Chikungunya, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). All of them had negative results.Furthermore, blood cultures were conventionally performed using the Bact/Alert 3D 120 automated microbial detection system. The initial incubation was performed with chocolate agar medium, in 5–10% CO2 at 35°C–37°C for 24 hours. Three blood samples were collected in the first 24 hours, at a minimum 15-minute interval between them, using venous puncture in different places. The colonies isolated on chocolate agar plates were identified by colonial morphology, gram stain, and oxidase reaction. Colonies appeared smooth, round, uniform, grey/brown, and 1 mm in diameter. The oxidase test and tributyrin agar test were positive. This result was positive for the presence of the microorganism M. osloensis in the three samples.Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was ordered, and it showed prolapsed mitral valve involving the posterior leaflet (P2 segment) with an echogenic structure adhered to the atrial face, with approximate dimensions of 0.47 × 0.85 cm, compatible with endocardial vegetation, determining failure of coaptation and a moderate degree of valvular insufficiency and eccentric jet. Intracavitary thrombi were absent, and systolic and diastolic functions of the left ventricle were normal. According to the criteria of Habib et al. [8], the diagnosis of IE was confirmed, and the patient was hospitalized for intravenous antibiotic therapy.Antibiotic therapy was prescribed from August 8 to September 28 with the administration of vancomycin for four days, gentamicin for 10 days, and ampicillin for 6 days, and after the result of blood culture, ceftriaxone was introduced for 36 days. Remission of signs and symptoms was observed as of August 12. Laboratory tests results were better, and blood cultures were sterile. Theses exams were repeated on August 21 and on September 15. Their results showed no alteration.After completing the therapeutic treatment with specific antibiotics, the patient underwent serial laboratory tests and was hospitalized. Another TEE was carried (09/21), and it revealed chordal rupture and moderate mitral regurgitation. Surgical correction was performed.On September 26, the patient underwent implantation of a mitral valve prosthesis. Surgery was performed without any complications. However, neither the culture nor the pathological anatomy of the surgically removed valve was performed. On October 06, the patient was discharged from the hospital with a prescription for oral anticoagulant warfarin.Eighteen months after the endocarditis episode, the patient was asymptomatic, in good physical condition. He attends follow-up visits with a cardiologist at the same hospital.The diagnosis of IE is challenging because of its quite variable clinical history, the epidemiological profile in evolution, the presence or absence of preexisting heart disease, prosthetic valves, and/or implantable cardiac devices, as well as its acute, subacute, or chronic nature [8]. Other diagnostic hypotheses can be considered such as other site infections, rheumatic disease, tumors, autoimmune diseases, and neurological diseases such as meningitis [9]. However, early evaluation by a cardiologist may help to improve diagnosis accuracy or avoid delays in final diagnosis [8, 10, 11].Fever with chills, lack of appetite, and weight loss are found in up to 90% of IE cases, heart murmurs in up to 85%, and embolic complications around 25% at the time of diagnosis [8–10]. Concomitant fever and embolic phenomena strongly lead to the diagnosis of IE [10]. The case description showed these unspecific symptoms (fever, myalgia, anorexia, and weight loss) similar to flu status. The presence of these signs and symptoms despite being common in IE can induce other diagnostic hypotheses. Microbiological investigations, such as blood culture, laboratory tests, biomarkers and mainly imaging, TEE and transthoracic, should be evaluated when suspecting IE, with three echocardiographic findings being the main criteria in the diagnosis of IE as vegetation, abscess or pseudoaneurysm, and new dehiscence of a prosthetic valve [8, 11].The first case report of IE caused by the microorganism M. osloensis dates from 1982, and it was described by Stryker et al. [12]. This study would be the fourth case since two more recent episodes were described by Gagnard et al. [2] in 2015, featuring individuals over 50 years old and significant immune impairment. The first manifested chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the second had a previous history of two episodes of IE in mitral valve prosthesis by Streptococcus and Staphylococcus sp., Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and renal transplantation.The patient of this case, affected by endocarditis due to M. osloensis infection, is different from those previously described in the literature, because he was a young adult, under 50 years old, immunocompetent, with no comorbidities and no obvious focus of infection. The scientific literature revealed less than 40 reports of infections by this species [2, 5], and most patients were at the extremes of age, under 6 and over 50 years old, and had a history of hematological malignancies [2, 13], solid neoplasms [14, 15], deficiency of complement [16], osteomyelitis [17], and previous surgeries [2], that is, documented presence of some factor predisposing vulnerability of the immune system [2, 11]. Probably, our patient had a viral infection of the upper airways. Then, this could have caused a drop in the immune status with an increased susceptibility to bacteremia. Therefore, this case highlights a rare impairment of the endocardium of an immunocompetent adult, with no comorbidities and no focus of infection [8, 9, 11].Furthermore, this case emphasizes that the diagnosis of IE must be considered even in patients with nonspecific symptoms and unexpected epidemiological profile. Although endocarditis presents a variable prognosis, mostly good, it is a serious infection that can lead to death.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
An Interesting Case and Literature Review of a Coronary Stent Fracture in a Current Generation Platinum Chromium Everolimus-Eluting Stent
1Institute for Heart and Vascular Health, Renown Regional Medical Center, 1500 E 2nd St No. 302, Reno, NV 89502, USA2Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Nevada-Reno, 1155 Mill St No. W11, Reno, NV 89502, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Sammy San Myint Aung; moc.liamg@ymmas.gnuaReceived 23 November 2017; Accepted 20 May 2018; Published 4 June 2018Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2018 Sammy San Myint Aung et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Coronary interventions are the mainstay of treatment for stenotic coronary vascular lesions. New stent designs are constantly being evaluated to improve stent performances and clinical outcomes. Coronary stent fracture is uncommon; however, it is associated with potential major consequences including acute coronary syndrome and the need for repeated target vessel revascularization due to in-stent restenosis or stent thrombosis. We report a case of a 66-year-old man with an extensive cardiac disease history, who presented with intractable angina and was found to have a fracture of a current generation, platinum chromium everolimus-eluting stent (Synergy, Boston Scientific Inc.).Coronary stent fracture is defined as a discontinuation of any part of the stent structure seen on angiogram. Stent fracture (SF) was first described with bare-metal stents in 2002 [1]. In 2004, it was subsequently reported with drug-eluting stents [2]. Newer designs, materials, and eluting drugs are being developed to improve the performance, safety, and long-term patency of drug-eluting stents (DES). Synergy stent (Boston Scientific Inc.) is one of the commonly used, current generation of platinum chromium everolimus-eluting stents (EES). To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previously reported case of a stent fracture involving this particular stent.The following case is of a 66-year-old man with a complicated cardiac history, who for some time has been experiencing limiting angina despite being on maximally titrated medical therapy of aspirin, prasugrel, carvedilol, ranolazine, isosorbidemononitrate (sustained release), atorvastatin, lisinopril, nitroglycerin patch, and as needed sublingual nitroglycerin. His cardiac history includes extensive coronary artery disease (CAD).
(i)Status post coronary artery bypass graft 15 years ago (CABG: reverse saphenous vein graft to first and second obtuse marginal arteries in a sequential fashion and reverse saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery and posterolateral artery in a sequential fashion)(ii)Status post redo CABG 2 years ago (CABG: left internal mammary artery [LIMA] to the left anterior descending artery [LAD])(iii)Status post multiple stentsHe also has a history of hypertension, diabetes (on metformin), dyslipidemia, and prior bilateral carotid endarterectomy. He was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery 8 months prior, and they recommended against reoperation.About 4 months prior, he underwent another coronary angiography. This angiogram showed a relatively long 95% stenosis in the mid-LAD. The stenosis extended from the mid-LAD to a bit passed the LIMA anastomosis, with retrograde flow into the LIMA (Figure 1). Some tenting of the LAD at the anastomotic site was also noted. Several predilations were performed at 8 and 10 atmospheres with no significant improvement to the stenosis. A 2.25 × 28 mm Synergy drug-eluting stent (Boston Scientific) was then deployed at 12 atmospheres and postdilated with 2.25 × 20 mm noncompliant balloon at 14 atmospheres. The stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD with no residual stenosis. A slight kink in the distal one-third of the stent at the LIMA insertion point was noted (Figure 2). Figure 3 further demonstrates the movement of the intact stent during diastole and systole. The patient’s symptoms temporarily improved.A short time after, he presented again with rest pain. His vital signs were stable. Physical examinations, including cardiac exams, were unimpressive. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm without significant ST/T changes. Two troponin levels drawn 12-hour apart were both normal. Repeat coronary angiography was performed. It revealed a mid-LAD stent fracture with 70% in-stent restenosis (fractional flow reserve of 0.78) (Figure 4). Coronary intervention was performed and a Xience Alpine DES was deployed inside the fractured Synergy DES with TIMI III flow and no residual stenosis (Figure 5). The patient tolerated the procedure and was discharged in stable condition.A coronary stent fracture is a discontinuation of any part of the stent structure seen on angiogram [3]. Depending on the study and type of stent, the incidences of SF lie between 0.5% and 19% [4–7]. In a pathological study, the incidence rose as high as 29% [8]. SF rates in sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) were mainly used in these studies. One study by Kuramitsu et al. had shown the incidence of SF in everolimus-eluting stent (EES) to be 2.9% [3]. However, with regard to SF rates, no study has included the Synergy PtCr EES, as yet. Synergy is an EES with a platinum chromium (PtCr) platform. It is a modification from the Promus Element PtCr platform and has thinner struts with a bioabsorbable polymer on the abluminal side [9]. In a randomized trial comparing safety and efficacy, Synergy was shown to be as effective, and slightly better trending, as the Promus element in their clinical endpoints [10].Coronary SF is thought to be due to a combination of unfortunate factors. These factors are all related to abnormal forces placed on the stent, creating metal fatigue and eventual fracture. Vessel tortuosity (especially in the right coronary artery), vessel calcification, ostial stent location, hinge motion, overlapping stents, increased stent length, smaller stent diameter, coronary aneurysm, and balloon overdilation are some of the known risk factors for SF [3, 4, 6, 7, 11]. The design of the Synergy due to its thin-strut and platinum chromium platform is said to incur flexibility and strength to prevent SF [3, 9]. However, a mechanism for SF in thin-strut DES is longitudinal stent deformation (LSD) [3]. LSD can be caused by balloon overexpansion and abnormalities in the vessel wall such as calcifications [6].Our patient had experienced intractable chest pain believed to be caused by the in-stent restenosis precipitated by the stent fracture. Clinically concerning complications of coronary stent fractures are acute coronary syndromes (ACS), in-stent restenosis (ISR), stent thrombosis (ST), and the possible need for target vessel revascularization (TVR) [3, 4, 11–13]. These manifestations are related to the disruption of the stent structure and the malapposition of the stent struts to the intimal surface of the vessel. Normally, a DES will provide sufficient amounts of antiproliferative drugs in the vicinity of smooth muscle cells on the vessel intima. However, during a SF, the struts that usually elute the drug are no longer adequately pressed against the vessel walls, thus allowing smooth muscle cells to proliferate. The fractured strut can also mechanically irritate the vessel wall and stimulate smooth muscle cell division, as well as become foci for thrombogenesis [3, 6, 7, 14, 15]. This can lead to a series of cascading events that ultimately disrupts the surrounding hemodynamic environment and lead to the abovementioned complications.In our case, the SF occurred at the mid-LAD, in the vicinity of the LIMA anastomosis (Figure 4). We believe that the Synergy EES came under a lot of external mechanical strain due to the vessel curvature, as well as the additional tenting force generated by the anastomosis with the LIMA. With each cardiac cycle, the hinge motion (Figure 3), created by the vessel’s tortuosity, lead to the eventual metal fatigue and fracture.The reported incidences of coronary SF may actually be underestimated. Considering the higher incidence reported by Nakazawa et al.’s pathological analysis and the varying incidences of 0.5% to 19% in other studies [4, 6–8], we can infer that a large number of SF are going undetected and are possibly asymptomatic. Like our case, most studies identify SF through angiography [4, 7]. The disadvantage, however, is the lower spatial resolution of angiography compared with other imaging techniques (intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography). Recent technological advancements have introduced the use of stent boost with angiography, a high resolution cine-angiography, that allows easier SF identification [7]. Optical frequency domain imaging has also demonstrated a good ability to detect coronary SFs, in addition to other vessel wall details [16]. Once a SF is identified, classification of the lesion becomes important, for both communication and future management. Lee et al. had used the following classification in their study [15].
(i)Type I: single strut fracture(ii)Type II: multiple strut fractures(iii)Type III: complete transverse fracture with no displacement(iv)Type IV: complete transverse fracture with displacementBased on this, our case would be considered a type IV fracture, the most severe form. There is no formal management guideline for treating coronary SF. In a single-center study by Lee et al., they proposed to treat SF with no signs of ISR with dual or triple antiplatelet therapy for an unknown duration of time. Significant ISR with severe SF (type II to type IV) warranted coronary intervention [15]. DES use in the treatment of SF was shown to have lower rates of target vessel revascularization than plain old balloon angioplasty [17]. Our patient was managed in a way consistent with the recommendations above. We treated our patient with a repeated coronary intervention using the Xience Alpine EES. Although overlapping stents are known to be a risk factor for further SF, it was important that such a severe stent fracture and in-stent restenosis be amended in an attempt to return maximal perfusion to distal tissues.Regardless of stent type and design, stent fractures are a complication that should always be considered. Vessel anatomy, hinge motions, overlapping stents, calcifications, and stent types are a few of the risk factors mentioned that should be incorporated in the decision process prior to performing coronary intervention. Having a simple yet accurate description of stent fractures based on image modality will help in standardizing appropriate treatment guidelines of coronary SF. Further studies on the clinical outcomes in patients who received stent-within-a-stent treatment, as our patient, would help in determining if this is the best treatment option for coronary SF.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Elevated Intracranial Pressure as a Cause of Sick Sinus Syndrome
1Research Institute of McGill University Health Center, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada2Department of Cardiology, McGill University Health Center, McGill University, Montreal, QC, CanadaCorrespondence should be addressed to Samer Makhaly; moc.liamtoh@ylahkam_remasReceived 20 February 2018; Revised 19 April 2018; Accepted 26 April 2018; Published 3 June 2018Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2018 Samer Makhaly et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) has multiple causes both familial and acquired. The most common cause is usually idiopathic. In the past literature, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) has not been reported to be a cause of SSS. We present a case of a 55-year-old male that developed SSS after surgical resection of a brain tumor. We have investigated the causal relationship between increased ICP and SSS. We have concluded that elevated ICP creates a sympathovagal imbalance leading to SSS.Sick sinus syndrome is the collection of clinical conditions that result from an abnormality of the sinoatrial nodal automaticity. Although it is usually idiopathic, a number of intrinsic and extrinsic causes have been described in the literature [1]. We report a case with a rare cause of SSS and the underlying pathophysiology that led to this presentation.A 55-year-old male presented to the emergency department 3 weeks after right frontal nodule resection of his multifocal glioblastoma multiforme. The tumor was also in the corpus callosum and the right pontine area. The patient was known to have high ICP (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging) due to the mass effect of the tumor for which a debulking surgery was done. Recovery from surgery went well, and the patient had a residual left-sided weakness and was able to ambulate by using a walker at discharge. At presentation to the emergency department, the patient had 2 episodes of unprovoked syncope with nausea, somnolence, and worsening of his left-sided weakness. The patient’s past medical history was insignificant except for controlled hypertension and epilepsy. The patient’s home medications were dexamethasone, levetiracetam, hydromorphone, perindopril, amlodipine, and pantoprazole. While in the emergency room, the patient was noted to have a temporary pause on the cardiac monitor which was symptomatic. The patient’s vital signs on admission were a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, blood pressure of 132/86, heart rate of 61, and respiratory rate of 18 (regular), afebrile, and an oxygen saturation at 94% on 2 L/min of oxygen. When the oxygen was removed, the patient’s respiratory rate decreased to 12, oxygen saturation dropped to 89%, and the patient became nonalert. An EKG was done which showed multiple intermittent sinus pauses of durations of 4–6 seconds. The blood work and urine analysis were all within the normal range. A diagnosis of SSS was made, and the patient was admitted to the CCU for pacemaker implantation. While admitted to the CCU, his EKG showed intermittent sinus pauses with the longest having a duration of around 3.6 seconds. A pacemaker was inserted. A 24-hour monitoring post procedure was uneventful, and the patient’s telemetry showed a normal sinus rhythm in the 80s to 90s with no paced beats. The patient was then discharged home to be followed up at the pacemaker clinic. During the follow-up, the patient’s hemiparesis did not recover and was still using the walker to ambulate. A computed tomography (CT) scan done later showed rapid progression of all lesions, except the one in the pons, with vasogenic edema. There was a significant mass effect with midline shift and uncal herniation.Sick sinus syndrome can be caused by genetic or acquired etiologies, but the most common cause is idiopathic. SSS was found to be associated with aging (mean age of 68 years old) due to age-related degenerative fibrosis of the SA node [2]. This is a less likely cause of SSS in this patient due to his relatively young age. Another possible cause of SSS that is related to this case is temporal partial seizure which has been reported to induce sinus arrest [3]. However, the patient was on levetiracetam and did not show the usual aura symptoms associated with a temporal partial seizure. Thus, this was excluded as a cause. To the best of our knowledge, none of the medications mentioned above has been reported to cause SSS. With the absence of any reported causes, SSS in this case is most likely to be caused by an imbalance of the autonomic tone to the SA node [4]. This, in theory, could be subdivided into either hypoactivity of sympathetic nerve outflow or hyperactivity of parasympathetic nerve outflow. The sympathovagal imbalance can be due to the local pressure effect of the pontine lesion or due to an increase in the ICP from the multifocal tumor.The autonomic nervous system has a major role in the pathogenesis of some of the extrinsic causes of SSS [5]. Vagally triggered sinus bradycardia secondary to increased ICP has been reported as early as 1901 by a well-known phenomenon known as “Cushing’s reflex.” It is a response by the autonomic nervous system to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion despite increased ICP [6]. Elevated ICP, as a result of subarachnoid hemorrhage, has also been reported to affect the function of the autonomic nervous system. Kawahara et al. stated that the high ICP triggered an increased vagal discharge to the heart leading to sinus cycle abnormalities [7]. A similar physiologic process was used to explain the occurrence of sinus arrest during rapid eye movement sleep [8].On the other hand, the sympathetic nervous system responds variably to increased ICP depending on the onset, duration, and severity of the intracranial hypertension. An acute elevation of the ICP leads to an initial response of increased heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure due to neurohumoral activation. With the continued increase in ICP, a triad of bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular breathing commences due to both sympathetic and vagal stimulations. Further elevation in the ICP to the degree of spinal ischemia leads to cardiovascular collapse [9–11]. These responses were observed with an ICP that was raised acutely and surpassing the mean arterial blood pressure. On a different note, Matsuura et al. concluded that with low to moderate ICP elevation, both arms of the autonomic nervous system are stimulated, where the parasympathetic stimulation is more profound [10, 12].Brainstem lesions are known to cause cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. A number of case studies have reported that compression of the vasomotor area occurs mainly due to lesions that lie within or close to the medulla oblongata. Both elevated ICP and brainstem lesions cause autonomic dysregulation via the same mechanism: brainstem compression [13–15]. A clinical picture of depressed global consciousness and respiratory depression in the context of a history of intracranial hypertension unresponsive to treatment indicates that the most likely cause of SSS in this case is elevated ICP.It is clearly evident that the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems influence the cardiovascular response to elevated ICP. Our patient did not present with a hyperdynamic state, and Cushing’s response and papilledema were absent. This implies that a gradual low to moderate elevation in the ICP was present. Based on our review of the literature, we have concluded that SSS in our case was due to spiked parasympathetic predominance primarily due to increased vagal discharge.ICP as a cause of SSS has been reported once in the literature by Takayama et al. [16]. The reported case had many factors that were more likely to cause SSS than the increased ICP. This included old age (84 years old) and ischemic heart disease [17]. In addition, SSS occurred just after the administration of vagomimetic anesthetic drugs, fentanyl and vecuronium, which was reported to cause SSS and is the most plausible cause in this scenario [18]. On the other hand, our patient was unique as there were no other confounding causes that might have precipitated SSS.Our patient demonstrates an unusual cause of SSS. Recognizing that increased ICP can cause SSS is important so that a high degree of suspicion is maintained and a closer follow-up of patients at risk can be done. In addition, patients at risk of ICP elevation should avoid certain medications that can cause SSS to manage their other comorbidities.We also recommend perioperative cardiac work up for elderly patients at risk of having elevated ICP, even in the absence of any cardiac risk factors or symptoms. This would include a 12-lead ECG to rule out any ECG abnormalities indicative of a silent SSS. Reports have recommended that in cases of silent SSS, patients would undergo pacemaker implantation before general anesthesia to protect them from any hemodynamic instability induced by the anesthetic drugs [19, 20]. If not, then vagomimetic anesthetic drugs must be used with caution to avoid hypervagotonic activity to the SA node.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.
A Complex Cardiac Mass Originating from Interatrial Septum in a Patient with History of Kidney Cancer: A Case Report and Literature Review

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is notorious for metastasis to cardiac tissue. Tumor thrombus migration to the renal vein and inferior vena cava happens in up to 10% of patients with RCC. Transitional cell carcinomas are another form of renal cancer, which may metastasize to the heart and are associated with widespread metastasis. Here, we report a patient with a past medical history of metastatic transitional cell cancer of renal pelvis under treatment with checkpoint inhibitor therapy presenting with shortness of breath. He had disseminated metastasis to bones, pleural space, lungs, and muscles. A large mass was found in the interatrial septum with invasion to the right and left atrium. The mass had a cystic component protruding into the left atrium. He passed away a few days after presentation.The estimated incidence of primary cardiac masses is less than 0.1 percent, while secondary cardiac masses are 20–40 times more common [1]. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the common causes of secondary cardiac tumors, and several cases of late metastasis from RCC have been reported years after curative excision of the primary tumor [2, 3]. Transitional cell carcinoma accounts for nearly 10 percent of all renal cancers, causing 3800 cases in the United States annually [4]. Cardiac involvement can occur in cases of widely metastatic transitional cell carcinoma [5, 6].Cardiac masses in renal cancers can be asymptomatic or can present with life-threatening medical emergencies, such as tamponade or outflow obstruction, causing hypotension, tachycardia, and shortness of breath. Cardiac involvement, especially through the lymphatic system, has been associated with widely metastatic disease [7]. In patients with a pertinent history of renal cancer, echocardiography can help to exclude cardiac masses as a cause of these symptoms [1, 8].A 32-year-old male presented with progressive shortness of breath and leg swelling. He had a past medical history significant for HIV disease and metastatic transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and left nephrectomy. He had metastatic involvement of the spinal bones, mediastinal lymph nodes, and lungs. He received gemcitabine and cisplatin followed by salvage treatment with atezolizumab. He was also on combination antiretroviral therapy (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir/alafenamide) with undetectable viral load and CD4 count of 444 cells/mm3.The physical exam was remarkable for tachycardia, respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds in the right hemithorax, and lower extremity swelling. A chest X-ray showed a right-sided pleural effusion and an enlarged nodular density in the left upper lobe. Laboratory data revealed anemia and an elevated troponin I. Patient symptoms resolved partially after he received a blood transfusion and underwent therapeutic thoracentesis. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function and a large, mobile, cystic mass in the right and left atrium. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a large mass composed of solid and cystic components. The solid component, a 5 × 2.3 cm2 mass, had invaded the basal half of the interatrial septum and the cystic component was found to protrude into the left atrium (Figure 1(d)). Multiple enhancing neoplastic masses in the muscular compartment in both calves were detected on MRI of the lower extremities, which were in favor of neoplastic lesions (Figures 1(e)–1(g)). The patient was not a candidate for surgery considering the extent of disease and he expired few days after presentation.In 9% of patients who died of cancer, cardiac metastases have been found at autopsy. Malignant melanomas, lung cancer, breast cancer, and renal carcinoma are commonly associated with secondary cardiac tumors. Cardiac involvement should be considered as differential diagnosis whenever a patient with known malignancy develops cardiovascular symptoms or signs, arrhythmia, or ECG changes [9].Cardiac metastasis of transitional cell carcinoma has been previously reported in the right ventricle, left atrium, and pericardium. Malde et al. reported a case of papillary muscle rupture following myocardial infarct secondary to tumor emboli [10]. The mechanism of spread is hypothesized to be either hematogenous, with macro- or micro-dissemination through the IVC typically involving the endocardium and cavity, or through the lymphatic system, which involves the myocardium and pericardium. The latter is more commonly associated with disseminated disease progression. There are several reports in the literature of endocardial metastasis, which could be the case in our patient who had disease of the interatrial septum and evidence of mediastinal lymph node involvement 2 months prior to presentation (Figures 1(a)–1(c)) [1, 7].Histology of the mass was unavailable; therefore, other differential diagnoses such as a second primary malignancy cannot be ruled out. However, the metastatic origin of the mass is more likely, considering widespread metastatic disease and the results of a prior biopsy of a pulmonary nodule, which revealed high-grade transitional cell carcinoma.Five-year cancer-specific survival rate of patients with high-grade transitional cell carcinoma is 35% [11]. The chemotherapy regimen of MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin) or GC (gemcitabine, cisplatin) is recommended for patients with advanced disease [12, 13]. Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy can be used for patients with progressive disease following platinum-based chemotherapy [14, 15].Management of secondary cardiac mass is a therapeutic challenge. Surgical resection can play an important role in palliation of isolated cardiac metastasis. Sobczyk et al. reported a case of transitional cell carcinoma metastasized to the left atrium, which was successfully removed by surgery; however, the patient passed away one month later because of progression of neoplastic disease [16]. Unfortunately, our patient was not a candidate for surgery because of his widespread neoplastic disease, and he died of respiratory failure a few days after the presentation.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a large mass composed of solid component in interatrial septum and cystic part protruding in the left atrium.

Severely Circumferentially Calcified Neointima as a New Cause of Undilatable In-Stent Restenosis
Department of Cardiology, Shingu Municipal Medical Center, Shingu, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Manabu Kashiwagi; pj.ca.dem-amayakaw@ihsakmReceived 10 January 2018; Revised 20 April 2018; Accepted 23 May 2018; Published 29 May 2018Academic Editor: Manabu ShirotaniCopyright © 2018 Manabu Kashiwagi et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 74-year old man presented recurrent angina pectoris due to in-stent restenosis (ISR) with severely calcified neointima. In-stent neoatherosclerosis (NA) is associated with late stent failure, and NA with calcified neointima occurs in some cases. Because the presence of neointimal calcification could lead to underexpansion of newly implanted stent for ISR, a scoring balloon was selected for predilatation to obtain maximum extrusion of the neointimal plaque and subsequently, an everolimus-eluting stent was implanted. However, moderate stenosis remained on coronary angiography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed underexpansion of the newly implanted stent because an attempt at balloon dilatation of neointimal calcification failed. Although OCT can clearly discriminate stent struts from neointimal calcification, we did not perform OCT assessment between scoring balloon and stenting. It is highly recommended to confirm whether the lesion is adequately treated by balloon angioplasty before stenting in cases with calcified ISR.Second-generation everolimus-eluting stent for in-stent restenosis (ISR) of drug-eluting stents (DES) is considered as an effective approach although some patients still have recurrences [1]. Currently, paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) has also been proposed as an alternative therapy for patients with ISR and could prevent target lesion revascularization better than conventional balloon angioplasty [2]. Although neointimal calcification (NC) is not frequent, the presence of NC could lead to underexpansion of newly implanted stent for ISR [3]. We therefore presented a patient with unfavorable acute result after intervention for DES-ISR with NC.A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of effort angina pectoris, and a 2.75 × 24 mm paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) was implanted at the midportion of left anterior descending artery. After the initial procedure with stent implantation, he underwent repeated angioplasty with cutting balloon due to ISR 4 and 8 months later. These two repeat angioplasties were effective and improved his symptoms. After 5 years, however, he suffered from recurrent chest pain. His coronary risk factors were hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM). Although aldosterone receptor antagonist was prescribed for hypertension, DM was followed with no medication. His hemoglobin A1c level was 6.3%, and serum levels of low-density lipoprotein was 122 mg/dl. Coronary angiography determined the tandem stenotic lesions within the previously implanted PES as shown in Figure 1(a). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed excessive neointimal hyperplasia within well-expanded stent struts at the distal site (Figure 1(b)). The neointima appeared as a signal-poor and heterogeneous region with s sharply delineated border on OCT image, suggesting a calcified lesion. Therefore, a 2.5 × 13 mm scoring balloon (Lacross NSE; Goodman, Nagoya, Japan) was selected for predilatation to obtain maximum extrusion of the neointimal plaque [4]. Subsequently, a 3.0 × 20 mm PCB (SeQuent Please; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Vascular System, Berlin, Germany) was utilized for the proximal lesion, and a 2.25 × 18 mm everolimus-eluting stent (Xience Xpedition; Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California) was implanted at the distal lesion. Although the proximal lesion was well treated with PCB, the coronary angiography still demonstrated moderate stenosis at the distal lesion (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). OCT revealed underexpansion of the newly implanted stent because an attempt at balloon dilatation of neointimal calcification failed (Figure 2(c)). A 2.5 mm noncompliant balloon was therefore applied for postdilatation, but it was not succeeded. Furthermore, a bigger size noncompliant balloon of 2.75 mm at high inflation pressure (24 atm) did not work well (Figure 2(d)). Even though underexpansion of the newly implanted stent and moderate stenosis were still present (minimum lumen area 2.39 mm2), we had to terminate the procedure to avoid the risk of perforation.Neoatherosclerosis (NA) is encountered at the late phase of implanted coronary stent because coronary stent evokes an inflammatory reaction [5]. Pathological study revealed that the incidence of NA is 31% in DES and 16% in bare-metal stent (BMS) [6, 7]. Moreover, two OCT studies reported that NA with calcified neointima occurred in about 10% cases [8]. Although calcified neointima is negligible, there have been few reports to date focusing on in-stent restenosis with calcified neointima [9]. Severely calcified neointima is occasionally undilatable by balloon angioplasty only and may lead to resistant ISR, requiring rotational atherectomy [10, 11]. In our case, preintervention OCT images indicated the heavily calcified tissue within the stent at the distal lesion. As a result, we should have confirmed whether the lesion is adequately treated by balloon angioplasty before stenting because residual underexpansion of implanted stent could contribute to recurrent ISR and stent thrombosis.The inadequate modification of NC led to underexpansion of newly implanted stent for ISR. It is highly recommended to confirm whether the lesion with NC is adequately treated by balloon angioplasty before stenting.Patient consent was obtained.The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.
Staphylococcus aureus Myocarditis with Associated Left Ventricular Apical Thrombus

Here, we report a case of a 44-year-old man on methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis who presented in septic shock and was diagnosed with staphylococcus aureus myocarditis. The myocarditis was associated with a left ventricular apical thrombus, with normal systolic function. The myocarditis and associated thrombus were characterised on transthoracic echocardiogram and subsequently on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging showed oedema in the endomyocardium, consistent with acute myocarditis, associated with an apical mural thrombus. Repeat CMR 3 weeks following discharge from hospital showed marked improvement in endomyocardial oedema and complete resolution of the apical mural thrombus. He was treated with a 12-week course of antibiotics and anticoagulated with apixaban. The patient was successfully managed with intravenous antibiotics and anticoagulation with complete recovery.Staphylococcus aureus is widely reported to be the most common bacterial cause of myocarditis and usually occurs in the setting of bacteraemia and sepsis. Rarely, it occurs without associated infective endocarditis [1, 2]. Furthermore, difficulty in determining the diagnosis, prevalence, and aetiology of myocarditis is complicated by the infrequent use of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), the diagnostic gold standard [2, 3].Noninvasive imaging such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has been shown to be reliable in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression in acute myocarditis [4, 5]. Despite the advances of noninvasive imaging, the sensitivity and specificity of CMR for acute myocarditis are reported at 81% and 71% and 63% and 40% in chronic myocarditis [6]. Ideally, CMR and EMB are both obtainable and are complimentary, overcoming limitations of either technique alone [4].Here, we present a case of Staphylococcus aureus myocarditis with associated left ventricular apical thrombus.A 44-year-old male was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) critically unwell with septic shock. On the day prior to admission, he had complained of lethargy, diffuse body aches, epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting and had experienced rigors. He had a medical background significant for rheumatoid arthritis, treated with methotrexate 10 mg weekly for the last five years and had recently travelled to Fiji.On arrival of paramedics, the patient was nonresponsive, febrile, and tachycardic, with an unrecordable blood pressure and mottled appearance of the skin. He was drowsy and confused on arrival to the emergency department and had prolonged capillary refill of five seconds, a lactate of 6.8. There was no clear focus of infection on examination, and cardiovascular examination was normal at this time. He was found to have an acute kidney injury, hepatic impairment, and coagulopathy, see Table 1. Blood cultures returned positive in 11 hours for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and antibiotics were changed to intravenous (IV) flucloxacillin. He was culture positive for 48 hours.His course was further complicated by development of left olecranon bursitis, treated by open drainage. The bursitis was culture negative but presumed septic. He also had several episodes of atypical chest pain. Electrocardiogram at the time of pain revealed sinus tachycardia, with lateral T wave inversion, and high-sensitivity troponin was elevated at 139 ng/L (NR < 26 ng/L). Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function, with an echo-dense mass in the apex, no valvular abnormality, and mild left atrial dilatation. The patient proceeded to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging which showed increased wall thickness in the mid to apical wall segments and high signal intensity in the mid to apical endocardium on short tau inversion recovery (STIR) imaging. There was late gadolinium enhancement in the same area, consistent with oedema in the apical endomyocardium (Figure 1). There was also a nonenhancing mass in the left ventricular apex consistent with thrombus and small bilateral pleural effusions (Figure 2).Anticoagulation with therapeutic dose enoxaparin was commenced, which was subsequently changed to apixaban 5 mg twice daily prior to discharge.A repeat echocardiogram was performed 10 days after the initial echocardiogram, which did not reveal any interval change. The patient was discharged with IV flucloxacillin to continue via a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and ongoing anticoagulation with apixaban. Repeat CMR was performed 3 weeks following discharge and revealed normal left ventricular cavity size, with mildly increased wall thickness in the mid to apical wall segments. Tissue characterisation was consistent with apical wall oedema, which had reduced significantly in size since the previous CMR, and complete resolution of the left ventricular apical mural thrombus and pleural effusions (Figure 3). He completed a 6-week course of IV flucloxacillin, followed by a 6-week course of oral dicloxacillin, and remained clinically well throughout this time.The majority of published cases of bacterial myocarditis are autopsy studies and predate the use of antibiotics [1]. Flaxman in 1943 described 17 cases of staphylococcal myocardial abscesses without endocarditis [7]. Sanders in 1963 reported nine similar cases [8]. A further seven cases of staphylococcal myocarditis have been reported, six of which died with diagnosis confirmed at autopsy [9–14]. One case had aortic valve insufficiency requiring valve replacement secondary to a massive intramyocardial abscess [15]. All cases developed septic shock as a result of staphylococcal bacteraemia, and one case died as a result of ventricular rupture [10]. Risk factors for infection were identified in four cases including end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis [12], steroid-dependent Crohn’s disease, and initiation of infliximab [15] and two cases with AIDS [13].This case demonstrates two aspects of myocarditis that are unusual: firstly, isolated staphylococcus aureus myocarditis with no evidence of valvular involvement and secondly, left ventricular apical thrombus formation in a patient with normal left ventricle systolic function.Isolated staphylococcus aureus myocarditis remains a rare condition. There have been case reports of both methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant infections. As distinct from endocarditis and device infections, these cases of myocarditis are almost exclusively described in individuals who are immunocompromised.Several conditions can present with thrombus or thrombus-like formation in the left ventricular apex, including dilated cardiomyopathy, Loeffler’s endocarditis, myxoma, Chagas disease, and aneurysms. Factors that influence thrombus formation include blood stagnation, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulable states [16, 17].In this case, the predominant force of Virchow’s triad is likely endothelial injury and inflammation secondary to myocarditis. Echocardiography demonstrated the apical mass but was not able to define the thrombus or associated inflammation in the myocardium, whereas CMR was useful for tissue characterisation but not able to identify the aetiology.Anticoagulation in cases of left ventricular thrombus, especially in the context of normal systolic function, has limited evidence but is used to reduce the risk of embolisation. Warfarin has historically been used due to familiarity and lack of evidence with direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Several cases of successful treatment with DOACs have been described [18], but to our knowledge, this is the first case of thrombus treatment with apixaban in the context of normal systolic function.There are no conflicts of interest to disclose for any of the authors.
Transcatheter Coil Embolization of Single Coronary Artery Fistula Using the Occlusion Test
1Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan2Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Shin Takahashi; pj.ca.dem-etawi@tnihsReceived 25 March 2018; Accepted 8 May 2018; Published 22 May 2018Academic Editor: Kuan-Rau ChiouCopyright © 2018 Shin Takahashi et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The case of a patient in whom hemodynamic and electrocardiographic studies using the occlusion test for coronary artery fistulas (CAF) were safely performed prior to catheter embolization is reported. A 1-year-old girl had a separate right coronary artery arising from a left single coronary artery that formed a significant coronary artery fistula to the right ventricle. Coronary steal by the large coronary artery fistula narrowed the left coronary artery. The right coronary artery branches could not be clearly identified due to an overlap with the fistula. Due to the long porous CAF, embolic procedures could cause serious complications. We confirmed the safety by performing an occlusion test of the CAF’s proximal blood vessels. Following total occlusion of the CAF for 10 minutes, pulmonary arterial pressure and aortic blood pressure were not significantly changed. No bradycardia, atrioventricular block, or ST changes were observed. Coil embolization treatment was performed safely. For patients with long distal CAF complicated with a single coronary artery, myocardial ischemia and conduction system disorders can be identified by performing the occlusion test before embolization.Coronary artery fistula (CAF) has congenital and acquired coronary artery abnormalities. This abnormality accounts for 0.27–0.4% of all congenital cardiac defects. Congenital single coronary artery comprises about 0.04% of congenital cardiac anomalies [1]. In addition, CAF complicated with single coronary artery is rare. Myocardial ischemia due to coronary steal is an extremely difficult problem, and its presence can be an indication for treatment. Acute complications associated with embolization of CAF include myocardial ischemia and conduction system disorders [2]. A case of significant CAF is presented in a heart with normal structure. A hemodynamic study involving an occlusion test of the fistula’s proximal vessel prior to catheter embolization was performed, and the patient safely underwent catheter treatment.The parents of the following patient have given their consent for the publication of this report.A 1-year-old girl presented with continuous heart murmur. Chest radiography showed slight cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio, 55%). Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and no ST changes. Echocardiography showed a dilated left main coronary trunk artery (LMT) and a right coronary artery (RCA) entering a right ventricular fistula. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) with three-dimensional volume rendering revealed the thick and torsional RCA originating from the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), with fistulous communication to the right ventricle via a large vessel (Figure 1(a)). In cardiac catheterization, the Qp/Qs was 2.6. The CAF was a “beaded and caliber change” form. Coronary angiography could not distinguish the RCA’s peripheral branches (Figure 1(b)). The sinus node branch, right ventricular branches, and acute marginal branch from the RCA could not be clearly identified. Additionally, neither the atrioventricular nor the posterior descending branch on the peripheral site could be identified due to an overlap with the fistula. Collateral vessels from the LCA to the same site also could not be identified. Because of the long porous CAF, there was a concern about the embolism disrupting peripheral branch blood flow. We tried the occlusion test on the proximal vessel of the CAF. Using the PercuSurge GuardWire™ system (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA, USA), an occlusion test was performed in the proximal site of the RCA using a 6 mm balloon (Figure 1(c)). Following total occlusion for 10 minutes, the pulmonary arterial pressure (systolic/diastolic/mean) changed from 19/10/15 to 18/10/14 mmHg and the aortic blood pressure changed from 109/49/64 to 109/57/66 mmHg, both of which had no significant changes. In addition, no bradycardia, atrioventricular block, or ST changes were observed on electrocardiogram. Coil embolization was performed with GDC™ Detachable Coils (Boston Scientific, Fremont, CA, USA) (Figure 1(d)). Because of the long porous CAF, the target vessel was an embolus of a long lumen. However, the embolic area did not cross the balloon occlusion site. Coil embolization treatment techniques were safely performed.After this procedure, anticoagulation therapy was continued. In cardiac catheter examination one year after coil embolization, the contrast effect of the LAD and left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) increased, and each coronary branch was easy to distinguish. The residual shunt from the CAF did not have a contrast effect. The proximal end of the coil-embolized CAF formed a thrombus and occluded. However, there existed right ventricular branches from the proximal side of the RCA. The sinus node branch revealed branching from the LCX. The collateral vessels from the developed septal branch, LAD, and sinus node branch supplemented the peripheral areas of the RCA (Figure 1(e)). The patient’s hemodynamics are now stable, and she is in good health.Up to 57% of patients with a CAF also have another congenital cardiovascular anomaly [3]. In patients with coronary fistulas, a coronary artery “steal” phenomenon can result in coronary blood preferentially passing through the fistula instead of the more distal myocardial capillaries. Angina has been reported in many patients with large fistulas and may be aggravated by distal coronary artery disease. In comparing CAF symptoms between adults and children, children more often have abnormal murmur and associated defects and rarely have CAF aneurysms and coronary artery disease. Symptoms are more likely to develop with advancing age, although treating asymptomatic CAF patients still poses management difficulties [4].CAF are classified as distal or proximal. The proximal type arises near the origin of the coronary artery. A short proximal segment of the feeding coronary artery may be dilated, but the distal end of the original coronary artery is thin. The original coronary branches responsible for blood flow steal are hard to identify. The distal type of CAF originates near the distal end of a branch coronary artery. The feeding coronary artery proximal to a distal fistula gives rise to coronary branches that supply the myocardium [5]. This case was a right distal CAF, in which the left coronary branches responsible for blood flow steal could not be identified.Therapies to close congenital CAF during childhood have been recommended to avoid complications such as myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, endocarditis, and aneurysmal dilatation [2]. Whether to treat CAF surgically or by percutaneous intervention in childhood is controversial. Of the acute complications following coil embolization, the most important are myocardial ischemia and conduction system disorders. Early complications have been reported to include transient ST-T wave changes, transient arrhythmias, distal coronary spasm, and fistula dissection [6]. In addition, there are many variations of the origin and course of coronary arteries in congenital heart disease, making percutaneous coronary intervention technically difficult. Asymptomatic children with large CAF who underwent therapeutic intervention have been reported [7]. Catheter techniques are difficult or impossible in a small percentage of patients, particularly younger pediatric cases, due to extreme vessel tortuosity and inability to deliver a catheter far enough distally [8]. The single coronary artery seen in this case is especially rare, making percutaneous coronary intervention technically difficult.A balloon occlusion test before coil embolization of a CAF is necessary to avoid complications, particularly when many coronary branches cannot be distinguished clearly in small pediatric patients [9].In patients with CAF, the coronary artery branches sometimes cannot be identified due to the presence of blood flow steal. In such cases, myocardial ischemia and conduction system disorders can be identified by performing the occlusion test before embolization.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Bisoprolol Transdermal Patch Is Effective for the Treatment of AF Tachycardia
Department of Cardiology, Japan Community Healthcare Organization (JCHO) Osaka Hospital, 4-2-78 Fukushima, Fukushima-ku, Osaka 553-0003, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Yoh Arita; pj.og.ohcj.akaso@oy-atiraReceived 12 January 2018; Accepted 10 May 2018; Published 21 May 2018Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2018 Yoh Arita et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related complications. Its incidence increases with age and the presence of concomitant heart disease. We present the cases of a 93-year-old woman, an 82-year-old man, and an 87-year-old woman who developed AF tachycardia. This report highlights the use of a bisoprolol transdermal patch to treat AF tachycardia in 3 adult elderly patients. In this paper, we report an initial treatment strategy using a bisoprolol transdermal patch and show heart rate trends for 24 hours.Clinical atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased rates of stroke, heart failure, mortality, hospitalization, and cognitive decline, much of which may present suddenly and constitute irretrievable harm [1, 2]. AF symptoms often include heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and weakness. Rate control is possible in the majority of patients with AF. Beta- (β-) blockers have been the most effective drugs [3]. However, swallowing tablets or capsules is sometimes difficult for elderly people because of dysphagia [4]. Moreover, aspiration pneumonia can be associated with dysphagia [5]. Bisoprolol is also available as a transdermal patch in Japan. Medication adherence is better with the use of a transdermal patch than with the use of tablets, particularly in elderly patients who might have difficulty with oral administration. In this paper, we report an initial treatment strategy for AF tachycardia using a bisoprolol transdermal patch in elderly patients.This 93-year-old woman, a resident of a special elderly care nursing home, was referred to our hospital for the treatment of cellulitis. She related a history of treatment for hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF). Upon arrival, her blood pressure (BP) was 119/83 mmHg and heart rate (HR) was 82 bpm. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated AF and a complete right bundle branch block (Figure 1(a)). During the treatment for cellulitis using antibiotics, she complained of dyspnea. Her HR increased to 140 bpm and her chest X-ray (CXR) showed pulmonary edema and congestion (Figure 1(b)). Echocardiography demonstrated preserved cardiac contractility with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%, indicating heart failure with a preserved EF. She was administered furosemide (20 mg/day) to treat heart failure. In addition, a bisoprolol transdermal patch (2 mg) was applied to her chest. Her HR trends were significantly decreased within 8 hours and the control of HR continued for 24 hours (Figure 2). Eventually, her CXR and symptoms improved.An 82-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of ileus. He related a history of treatment for persistent AF and hypertension. He was administered bisoprolol fumarate tablets (2.5 mg/day) for AF before admission. His HR on admission was 87 bpm. However, he could not take oral medicine because of fasting for treatment of ileus. After 3 days of fasting, he developed AF tachycardia and his HR increased to 150 bpm. Bisoprolol transdermal patch (4 mg) was applied to his chest. This dose was equal to a 2.5 mg bisoprolol fumarate tablet. His HR trends were significantly decreased after 8 hours of bisoprolol transdermal patch, and the frequency and duration of AF decreased until 24 hours after administration (Figure 3).An 87-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for treatment of AF with palpitation and dyspnea (Figure 4(a)). She related a history of treatment for hypertension and cerebral infarction but no history of heart failure and/or arrhythmia. Upon arrival, her BP was 102/54 mmHg and HR was 151 bpm. Her heart rhythm often spontaneously alternated between AF and sinus rhythm (Figure 4(b)). Echocardiography demonstrated preserved cardiac contractility with an EF of 64%, indicating heart failure with preserved EF. She was administered verapamil (5 mg) injection; however, there was no decrease in HR or frequency of rhythm alternation. Next, bisoprolol transdermal patch (4 mg) was applied to her chest. Her HR trends were significantly decreased after 6 hours on the bisoprolol transdermal patch and the frequency and duration of AF decreased until 24 hours after administration (Figure 5). Moreover, her symptoms were improved.AF is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related complications. Its incidence increases with age and the presence of concomitant heart disease [6]. Rate control in AF improves the quality of life, reduces morbidity, and decreases the potential for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Multiple agents, including β-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and certain antiarrhythmic drugs, including amiodarone and sotalol, have been evaluated for efficacy in attaining rate control [1]. β-blockers are the most commonly used drugs to control the ventricular rate during AF [3]. β-blockers also have an antiarrhythmic effect due to the suppression of sympathetic activity [7]. By reducing sympathetic tone, conduction over the atrioventricular node is slowed and atrioventricular nodal refractoriness is increased.Bisoprolol, also available as a transdermal patch in Japan, is indicated for the management of hypertension [8]. However, bisoprolol fumarate tablets are used for the management of patients with AF tachycardia [6]. Switching therapy from landiolol to bisoprolol transdermal patch is often performed in patients with AF tachycardia because the latter is relatively easy to manage [9–11]. A recent study reported efficacy and safety when switching from bisoprolol fumarate tablets to a bisoprolol transdermal patch at a dose conversion rate of 5 : 8 [12]. There are several benefits to using a transdermal patch instead of tablets. First, medication adherence is better because patients or caregivers can monitor medication through direct observation of the transdermal patch. Second, a transdermal patch can be used in patients for whom oral treatment is difficult, including those whose swallowing function has been impaired, those with gastrointestinal disease, and those who require tracheal intubation for an operation or pneumonia.The current cases may provide physicians with an initial treatment strategy for the use of a bisoprolol transdermal patch for AF tachycardia patients and especially in elderly patients who are relatively difficult to treat with oral medication.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.
The Heart as a Site of Metastasis of Benign Metastasizing Leiomyoma: Case Report and Review of the Literature
Departments of Cardiology and Internal Medicine, University of Maryland Midtown Campus, University of Maryland Medical System, Baltimore, MD, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Mariam Meddeb; moc.liamg@beddemmairamReceived 23 December 2017; Accepted 3 April 2018; Published 21 May 2018Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2018 Mariam Meddeb et al.

While the lung is the most common extrauterine organ afflicted, benign metastasizing leiomyomas (BML) of the heart are rarities. We report an incidental finding of a cardiac mass in a 36-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department after a motor vehicle accident. CT scan of the chest revealed 2 well-circumscribed pulmonary nodules and a filling defect in the right ventricle. Echocardiogram showed a 4 cm mass attached to the right ventricular (RV) septum. The cardiac tumor was resected and showed benign histologic features. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for smooth muscle α-actin and desmin, as well as estrogen and progesterone receptors, consistent with the diagnosis of uterine leiomyoma.We present the case of a cardiac benign metastasizing leiomyoma incidentally found in a patient who presented to our hospital after a motor vehicle accident.A 36-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department of our hospital with right-sided blurry vision after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. The patient was a restrained back seat passenger and sustained a right eye trauma with no other injuries nor loss of consciousness. She was found to have traumatic uveitis. CT scan of the head and sinuses showed no evidence of fracture or acute pathology. A CXR was performed to rule out any rib fracture and found a 1.1 cm pulmonary nodule in the right midlung. A contrast CT scan confirmed the presence of 1.1 cm nodule within the anterior inferior aspect of the right upper lobe and found an additional 1 cm nodule within the posterior superior aspect of the right upper lobe. Both nodules were well circumscribed, compatible with benign nature. Unexpectedly, a large defect was noted within the contrast-enhanced right ventricle and was thought to be a large thrombus extending to the right ventricular outflow tract (Figure 1). The patient was started on therapeutic anticoagulation overnight. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and a subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) disclosed the presence of a large mobile mass in the right ventricle arising from the interventricular septum. Turbulent flow was demonstrated in the right ventricular outflow tract (Supplemental Material video (available here)). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed an oblong soft tissue mass that measured 4.9 cm in length abutting the pulmonary valve. The mass occupied the entire RV outflow tract (Figure 2).The patient denied any symptoms including chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, or weight loss. Physical exam was significant for a systolic murmur. On further history taking, she reported that she underwent a hysterectomy 12 years earlier for “myomas” but denied any personal or family history of malignancy.Abdominal/pelvic CT scan was performed and confirmed the absence of the uterus. No definite evidence of primary or metastatic disease was found with the exception of a 2.2 × 1.7 cm soft tissue nodule at the left aspect of the vaginal cuff, which was thought to be the left ovary. CA 125 level was within normal limits.In the absence of evidence of primary malignancy, surgical resection of the cardiac tumor was pursued.Intraoperatively, the mass was noted to be encircling the tip of a papillary muscle which was supporting the chordae to the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The mass was completely excised with sacrifice of the chordae tendinae traversing the lesion (Figure 3) and subsequent tricuspid valve repair (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene neochords and anteroposterior commissuroplasty).Histologically, the tumor was composed of smooth muscle proliferation and a very low index of proliferation (Ki-67 < 10%), supporting a benign process. No atypia or necrosis was noted.Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were strongly positive for smooth muscle α-actin, desmin, estrogen, and progesterone receptors, supporting a leiomyoma lineage.The diagnosis of fibroma was excluded in light of the desmin stain positivity and elastin stain negativity. Immunostain for myogenin was negative, excluding the diagnosis of hamartoma of mature cardiac myocytes.FDG PET-CT was performed postoperatively and revealed a faint FDG uptake within the 2 previously identified pulmonary nodules (SUV 1.4) and the soft tissue nodule on the left aspect of the vaginal cuff, later identified as parasitic leiomyoma by transvaginal ultrasound (US) and not the left ovary as initially thought.No additional sites of metastasizing leiomyoma were identified.The patient recovered from cardiac surgery without complications. She was subsequently started on aromatase inhibitor treatment (anastrozole). CT scan of the chest-abdomen-pelvis 3 months after surgery showed stable pelvic and lung masses and no evidence of recurrent disease in the right ventricle. No interval growth of other masses was found. The patient remains asymptomatic 6 months after surgery.Uterine leiomyomas are the most common gynecological tumors in pre-menopausal woman, found in up to 30% of women older than 35 years.Despite being histologically benign, leiomyoma has clinically malignant potential. Metastases have been reported to a number of different sites, including the spine [1–4], skull [1], rib and vertebra [5], retroperitoneum [6], parametria [7], appendix [7], lymph nodes [8, 9], and most commonly the lung [10].Different types of extrauterine growth of benign uterine leiomyomas are described as follows: disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis (DPLM), retroperitoneal leiomyomatosis (RPLM), parasitic leiomyoma, BML, and intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) [11].DPLM and RPLM are characterized by multiple leiomyomatous masses seen in the submesothelial tissues of the abdominopelvic peritoneum and the abdominopelvic retroperitoneum, respectively [11]. Parasitic leiomyoma is observed when occasionally, a leiomyomatous mass loses its original attachment to the uterus, becomes adherent to a surrounding structure (most commonly the broad ligament), and develops an accessory blood supply. Parasitic leiomyoma can be diagnosed on pelvic US based on their typical whorled appearance with clear visual separation from the uterus and ovaries [11]. Transvaginal US allowed the diagnosis of parasitic leiomyoma in the case of our patient and confirmed that the patient was status post hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy. RPLM, DPLM, and parasitic leiomyoma are strictly confined to the abdomen and pelvis.In contrast, BML and IVL can cause more distant metastases, particularly to the chest.Intravascular leiomyomatosis is characterized by the presence of vascular invasion and extension of benign smooth muscle lesions in a worm-like manner into the pelvic and systemic veins. No macroscopic vascular invasion is found in BML. Owing to its intraluminal growth, leading to symptoms of venous obstruction [12], IVL has an aggressive clinical presentation, while BML typically has a very indolent clinical course.In IVL, US shows vascularized thrombi within the pelvic veins and inferior vena cava. CT and MR imaging demonstrate continuity in intraluminal growth from the pelvic veins [11]. None of these features were demonstrated in our patient, supporting the diagnosis of BML as opposed to IVL.Pathogenesis of BML is controversial [13]. However, although no vascular invasion can be identified clinically or on imaging in BML, several works support microscopic vascular invasion as the metastatic mechanism of BML [14, 15] suggesting a unified pathogenesis to both IVL and BML by hematogenous spread.While several cases of cardiac metastases have been reported with IVL [12, 16], to our knowledge, this is only the 5th case of BML metastasizing to the heart reported in the literature [17–20]. All previously reported cases had a history of hysterectomy up to 16 years prior to cardiac metastases. While 2 patients had dyspnea at the time of presentation [17, 19], 3 other patients including ours denied any cardiac symptoms and were only positive for a systolic cardiac murmur [18, 20]. Our case is the first case of BML to the heart found fortuitously on imaging and the youngest patient at the time of diagnosis of the cardiac mass.The mass initially identified on the chest CT scan was erroneously thought to be a thrombus, leading to initiation of anticoagulation. Thrombus accounts for the most commonly encountered intracardiac mass and typically appears on CT scan as a hypodense, low attenuation filling defect, similar to intracardiac tumors [21]. While CT is not an adequate exam for intracardiac tumors, TEE is the initial diagnostic imaging workup for a cardiac mass but is operator dependent and can sometimes be diagnostically limited by its reliance on the anatomic appearance of the mass. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has become the gold standard for evaluation of such masses and allows optimal tissue differentiation and accurate characterization of the mass preoperatively [17, 20]. CMR enables the differentiation of intracardiac thrombus from a tumor due to avascular tissue composition. Early gadolinium enhancement (EGE) imaging is the ideal technique. Thrombus manifests an absence of gadolinium uptake and appears almost black on EGE imaging [22]. T1- and T2-weighted signals vary depending on the age of the thrombus. BML typically displays intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images, low signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and homogenous contrast enhancement [11, 22]. Interestingly, PET-CT scan also provides helpful diagnostic information as BML, like other benign tumors, has low metabolic activity with faint or nonavid FDG uptake characterized by SUVmax lower than 2.5, in contrast to malignant lesions [23, 24].Uterine leiomyomatosis is highly hormone sensitive, and treatments are based on hormonal manipulation [25–27] with either surgical or medical castration [28, 29]. Hormone suppression has been shown to either stabilize or even induce regression of metastatic lesions [30].However, medical treatment alone is highly insufficient in the case of intracardiac tumors. This is related to the risk of heart failure and possible sudden death caused by total outflow tract obstruction. Regardless of the pathogenesis of intracardiac leiomyomatosis, review of the literature suggests that surgical removal of the intracardiac tumor is curative [16, 31]. Complete removal is strongly recommended, as no recurrence has been reported with total resection, as opposed to 1/3 recurrence rate in patients who underwent partial resection [16]. This is regardless of postoperative antiestrogen therapy.This case underlines the importance of considering BML as a potential differential diagnosis in any female patient with a history of hysterectomy who presents with an intracardiac tumor.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.The authors thank Murtaza Y.

A 24-year-old man presenting dyspnea at rest and leg edema was admitted to our hospital. He had been diagnosed with CML and prescribed dasatinib for 4 years. Chest X-ray showed significant bilateral pleural effusion and heart enlargement. Echocardiography revealed interventricular septal compression and elevated peak tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient of 66.7 mmHg indicating severe pulmonary hypertension. After the other specific diseases to provoke PAH were excluded, he was diagnosed with dasatinib-induced PAH. Despite discontinuation of dasatinib and intravenous administration of diuretic for two weeks, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class was still II and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was high at 37 mmHg. Therefore, we administered sildenafil and bosentan together as an upfront combination therapy three weeks after dasatinib discontinuation. Six months later, his symptoms improved to WHO functional class I and mean PAP was decreased to 31 mmHg. Although PAH is a rare complication of dasatinib, symptomatic patients prescribed with dasatinib should have an echocardiogram for PAH screening. Moreover, the upfront combination therapy would be a useful option for symptomatic patients after discontinuation of dasatinib.Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as an elevation in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 25 mmHg or more at rest. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a subgroup of PH and characterized by remodeling of pulmonary vasculature, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and PAP. It is reported that some drugs including dasatinib cause PAH [1].Dasatinib, a second generated tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is widely used as a first-line therapy for chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). Among the complications of dasatinib, PAH is a rare but severe complication. To treat dasatinib-induced PAH, some cases have demonstrated the effectiveness of pulmonary vasodilators [2]. However, data regarding the use of vasodilators are limited. Here, we present a case of dasatinib-induced PAH treated with an upfront combination therapy with vasodilators.A 24-year-old man with no past history of cardiopulmonary disease visited our hospital because of worsening of dyspnea at rest and leg edema. He had been diagnosed with CML seven years ago and initially treated with imatinib. Three years later, imatinib was switched to dasatinib (Sprycel®, Bristol-Myers; 100 mg/day) because of the incomplete molecular remission.On admission, he developed increased nocturnal dyspnea, leg edema, and nausea. His blood pressure was 104/71 mmHg, heart rate was regular at 103 bpm, body temperature was 37.0°C, and oxygen saturation was 91% in room air. An X-ray examination found significant bilateral pleural effusion and heart enlargement (Figure 1(a)). An electrocardiogram showed low voltage in the limb lead, left axis deviation, clockwise rotation, and negative T waves in the V1-V2 lead indicating pleural effusion and right ventricular enlargement (Figure 1(b)). A transthoracic echocardiography revealed an enlarged right ventricle (D1 59 mm, D2 48 mm) with flattening of the interventricular septum during systolic and diastolic phases and severe tricuspid regurgitation with the elevated tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG) of 66 mmHg, indicating increased PAP and volume overload (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). A chest contrast-enhanced computed tomography and a ventilation-perfusion lung scintigraphy showed no findings suggestive of thromboembolic disease. After the other specific diseases known to provoke PAH including human immunodeficiency virus infection, connective tissue disease, right-to-left shunt, and left heart disease were excluded, he was diagnosed with dasatinib-induced PAH in August 6, 2015.After the admission as day 1, dasatinib was discontinued on day 2 and switched to bosutinib on day 14 which is another TKI used as a third choice for CML. In addition, bolus injection of loop diuretic (furosemide 20 mg daily from days 2 to 5) and oral diuretic (azosemide 60 mg qd from day 3) was started.Two weeks after admission, his body weight decreased from 70.3 kg to 59.6 kg and pulmonary effusion disappeared. However, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class was still class II, and flattening of the interventricular septum and elevated TRPG (44 mmHg) was observed by the echocardiography. In right heart catheterization (RHC) on day 15, PAP was 55 (systolic)/26 (diastolic)/37 (mean) mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 8 mmHg, cardiac output was 6.55 l/min, cardiac index was 3.72 l/min/m2, and pulmonary vascular resistance was 353 dyne s cm−5, respectively (Figure 2).Since discontinuation of dasatinib and diuretic administration had an insufficient therapeutic effect to decrease dyspnea and PAP, we started the upfront combination therapy with sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, at 20 mg tid, and bosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, at 62.5 mg bid on day 20. One month later, his symptom was improved to WHO functional class I, mean PAP measured by RHC on day 15 was slightly reduced to 35 mmHg, and B-type natriuretic peptide level was decreased from 785 to 36 pg/ml. Six months later, mean PAP measured by RHC was decreased to 31 mmHg (Figure 2). The echocardiography also showed improvements in the right ventricular diameter (D1 48 mm, D2 40 mm) as shown in Figure 3. Finally, 12 months after the upfront combination therapy and dasatinib discontinuation, TRPG evaluated by the echocardiography was decreased to 24 mmHg.We encountered a case of severe dasatinib-induced PAH that was improved by the upfront combination therapy of vasodilators using a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor and an endothelin receptor antagonist.Dasatinib is a second generated TKI that was recently approved as a first-line therapy for CML. Dasatinib inhibits not only the BCR-ABL oncogenic tyrosine kinase in Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML but also other tyrosine kinases. Bosutinib is also approved for salvage therapy in CML. Unlike other TKIs, bosutinib does not significantly inhibit Kit protein or platelet-derived growth factor receptor [3]. Among these tyrosine kinases, Src tyrosine kinase has been identified as likely the cause of PAH. The Src tyrosine kinase is abundantly expressed in vascular tissue. Activation of Src appears to play a critical role in proliferation of smooth muscle cells and vasoconstriction. Recently, Guignabert et al. demonstrated that chronic administration of dasatinib can cause pulmonary endothelial damage and PH in rats [4]. When monocrotaline and chronic hypoxic stress were given to the rats that were treated with dasatinib, imatinib, or a control vehicle, PH and pulmonary artery wall thickening occurred in only the dasatinib-treated rats in a dose-dependent manner. They highlighted that Src inhibitory profile of dasatinib exacerbated pulmonary hypertension, which was not observed in imatinib treatment. In addition, clinical report showed that imatinib improved exercise capacity and hemodynamics in advanced PAH patients [5]. Thus, it is important to know the character and kinase pathway when we choose TKIs for CML treatment. In this case, we changed dasatinib to bosutinib as a third-line therapy because there was no report of bosutinib-induced PAH at the time of the medication switch. However, recently, some case reports showed bosutinib occasionally provoked PAH [6], which has similar inhibitory profile on tyrosine kinases as dasatinib [3]. Given the patient’s refractoriness to imatinib, an alternative TKI was used, which fortunately to date has not produced recurrent PH symptoms in the patient even though there are reported cases of bosutinib-associated PH and though the putative causative pathway may be invoked by both drugs.A French group reported the incidence of dasatinib-induced PAH as 0.45% (13 out of 2900 patients) among symptomatic patients [1]. However, according to another report, increased right ventricular pressure was observed in 5 out of 38 patients (13.2%) assessed by echocardiography [7]. This incidence was higher than that in the previous report [1], suggesting the presence of asymptomatic dasatinib-induced PAH. Since pleural effusion and systemic edema are common side effects of dasatinib, it is quite difficult to distinguish PAH from common side effects by only symptoms. Therefore, early screening by echocardiography to detect the development of PAH is necessary in symptomatic patients.It is reported that 34 out of 36 patients (94%) with dasatinib-induced PAH recovered by discontinuation of dasatinib, but 15 out of 36 patients (41.6%) did not show complete hemodynamic recovery [8]. Moreover, in another report on dasatinib-induced PAH, mean PAP did not decrease to less than 25 mmHg even with drug discontinuation or single vasodilator therapy [1]. Based on these findings, only drug discontinuation might not enough for complete remission of PH, suggesting the relevance of aggressive PH specific therapy. In fact, in our case, with the upfront combination therapy for 12 months, TRPG evaluated by the echocardiography was decreased to 24 mmHg.The optimal timing and combination of the vasodilator intervention are still under debate. Since SUPER-2 trial showed that 12 weeks delay of the vasodilator made the prognosis of the patients worse [9], we decided to treat the patient with the upfront combination therapy after 4 weeks of dasatinib discontinuation aiming rapid and better outcome. Recently, AMBITION trial showed that initial combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil resulted in a significantly lower risk of clinical failure events for the patients with PAH [10]. In this case, we chose bosentan and sildenafil because the AMBITION trial had not been published yet at the time of medication switch. Although the combination therapy with bosentan and sildenafil does not have evidence, initial use of these two drugs efficiently ameliorated the patient’s symptoms. It could be another option for dasatinib-induced PAH treatment. Further accumulation of the cases is needed.We experienced a case of dasatinib-induced PAH during the treatment of CML. We should consider the upfront combination therapy for symptomatic patients with PAH after discontinuation of dasatinib. Moreover, we strongly recommend routine screening of PAH by echocardiography during dasatinib or other TKI therapy in patients with edema or plural effusion.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.
Sacubitril/Valsartanstive Heart Failure: Cardiogenic Shock
1Internal Medicine, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 611 West Park St., Urbana, IL 61801, USA2Department of Cardiovascular Diseases and Clinical Electrophysiology, Christie Clinic, 1400 West Park St., Urbana, IL 61801, USACorrespondence should be addressed to H. A. Rawal; moc.oohay@0121lawarhsrahReceived 5 October 2017; Accepted 29 January 2018; Published 15 May 2018Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2018 H. A. Rawal and A. G. Kocheril. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Sacubitril/valsartan is a combination drug described as a new class of dual-acting angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) for heart failure. We present a case of a patient with NYHA class IV systolic heart failure who was refractory to all other classes of heart failure medications and was started on this new medication. On sacubitril/valsartan, he developed cardiogenic shock. This led us to reevaluate the use and risks of this medication in the class IV heart failure population.In the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines [1], congestive heart failure (CHF) is defined as “a complex clinical syndrome that can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill or eject blood” [1]. In the US, the prevalence of HF exceeds 5.8 million, and the incidence is >550,000/year [2]. ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta-blockers have been associated with decreased mortality in clinical trials. There is consensus that both of these medications are complementary and can be started at the same time as soon as the diagnosis of HF is made.Sacubitril/valsartan (initially referred to as LCZ696) is an orally acting supramolecular sodium salt complex of the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug sacubitril and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan, which was recently approved for the treatment of chronic heart failure (NYHA classes II–IV) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [3]. This drug has been studied in patients with heart failure with both preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). It has shown to reduce mortality in patients with HFrEF; however, its mortality benefits in HFpEF still need to be studied as per the PARAMOUNT trial.A 76-year-old male with a history of systolic CHF, NYHA class IV, presented with worsening shortness of breath over 4 weeks and fleeting chest pains. He mentioned having orthopnea and cough with blood-tinged sputum. On examination, he was tachycardiac, and heart rate was irregular, but other vitals were stable; he did not have jugular venous distention but had basilar crackles. He also had a history of coronary artery disease and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention. EKG showed atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular rate and a right bundle branch block. Labs were unremarkable except an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). A recent echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 22% with global left ventricular hypokinesis. His St. Jude Medical Fortify Assura VR single-lead ICD was interrogated and was functioning normally. Along with diuresis, he was started on IV diltiazem drip for his uncontrolled AF. He had been intolerant to guideline-directed heart failure therapy in the past. Prior to his admission, treatment with lisinopril resulted in severe cough, losartan caused symptomatic hypotension, and carvedilol caused shortness of breath. Since his BP was 137/85, a decision was made to start the patient on low-dose sacubitril/valsartan without any other medications given the intolerance to routine HF medications. Within 2 doses and 24 hours of starting the medication, he had an episode of severe hypotension requiring pressor support for cardiogenic shock (Figure 1). Sacubitril/valsartan was discontinued since it was the only vasoactive medication the patient was receiving at that time for his heart failure, and subsequently, amiodarone was used for rhythm control in AF. While off that medication, the patient was treated for his cardiogenic shock, which included dobutamine. The blood pressure recovered transiently followed by a persistent drop despite maximal efforts. The family decided to withdraw care given his refractory cardiogenic shock. The time between starting sacubitril/valsartan and the time of death of the patient was 11 days.In the large, randomized, double-blind PARADIGM-HF trial, sacubitril/valsartan has demonstrated substantial reductions in all-cause mortality due to heart failure without altering its safety profile when compared to the standard treatment for heart failure [4]. On comparing sacubitril/valsartan with enalapril, there was a greater incidence of symptomatic hypotension but less angioedema [3]. ACE inhibitors are typically available in various doses, which can be titrated, whereas sacubitril/valsartan is available only in two doses. As per the ACC/AHA recommendations, sacubitril/valsartan and ACE/ARB should not be given within 36 hours of each other to reduce the risk of angioedema [3].Besides the cardiac side effect profile, recently some light has been shed on the noncardiac side effects of this medication with long-term use. These include amyloid deposition in the eye and the brain, which theoretically can lead to visual and cognitive impairment [5, 6]. From previous studies, these side effects were considered only theoretical since it would likely take 10 to 20 years of use with this medication before the actual signs of disease were seen and the lifespan of most patients being on the drug was usually less than the time it may take for the long term neurocognitive side effects to develop [5, 6]. Hence, these side effects were given little importance. However, a recent letter in response to the statements suggested that eligible patients aged 55 years from the PARADIGM-HF trial had a projected life expectancy of 11.6 years while receiving enalapril and 12.9 years with sacubitril/valsartan, a difference of 1.3 years. Similar results were reported in eligible patients aged 65 years (10 years for enalapril versus 11.4 years for sacubitril/valsartan) [4–6]. These survivals clearly do indicate that the visual and cognitive side effects can be relevant. However, PARADIGM-HF trial did not have cognitive testing as a part of its follow-up in patients at 27 months. Hence, more research needs to be done so that we do not turn a blind eye to possible additional side effects of this medication [4–6].We present a case of severe hypotension/cardiogenic shock that occurred after starting sacubitril/valsartan in a patient with NYHA grade IV heart failure. We feel the use of this medication should be limited to patients with NYHA class II and III systolic HF, which was most of the enrolled population in PARADIGM-HF. If any class IV patients were included, few patients who were hypotensive in the run-in period were not enrolled. As stated in the ACC/AHA guidelines, the incidence of severe hypotension and cardiogenic shock is likely to be higher in patients with NYHA class IV systolic heart failure, warranting at least added caution when using it in these patients. It is possible that visual and cognitive side effects will play an important role in patients who are on long-term use of this medication, thus likely necessitating regular testing.Learning Points for Clinicians. (1) Create more awareness about the use of this new heart failure medication in NYHA class IV patients. (2) Side effect profile including life-threatening complications like cardiogenic shock in advanced heart failure patients and non-life-threatening but concerning long-term effects like visual and cognitive impairment with prolonged use. (3) Necessity for further researches about potential long-term side effects of sacubitril/valsartan and its use for patients with diastolic heart failure.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Successful Coronary Protection during TAVI in Heavily Calcified Aortic Leaflets in Patient with Short and Low Left Coronary System
JFK Medical Center, University of Miami School of Medicine, Atlantis, FL, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Mohamad Kabach; moc.liamg@hcabak.dhmReceived 14 July 2017; Revised 15 February 2018; Accepted 4 March 2018; Published 14 May 2018Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2018 Mohamad Kabach et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been recently approved for patients who are high or intermediate risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. The procedure is associated with several known complications including coronary related complications. Coronary obstruction is rare but disastrous complication, and it is associated with a high mortality rate. Coronary protection technique has emerged as a preemptive technique to avoid this complication. We present a case of successful coronary protection during TAVR in severely calcified left cusp in patient with short and low left ostium.Surgical aortic valve replacement has been the mainstay of treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. The transcatheter approach comes to the rescue as a less invasive treatment in these high-risk patients [1] or old patients with intermediate risk [2] as well as inoperable patients [3]. TAVR has been associated with vascular, cerebrovascular, valvular, and conduction complications. A rare, life-threatening complication of TAVR is a coronary ostial obstruction. Several cases were reported in this field [4]. A systematic review of reported cases suggests that it occurs more often in women and in patients receiving a balloon-expandable valve. However, this complication has not been evaluated in comparative studies of CoreValve and SAPIEN transcatheter valve models [5]. Coronary protection during TAVI is a preemptive technique recommended in certain cases to avoid this complication. We report a case of successful coronary protection in patient with severely calcified aortic valve in patient with short and low left coronary system.An 86-year-old woman with known history of coronary artery disease and sick sinus syndrome was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, orthopnea, and exertional dizziness. Physical exam revealed bibasilar crackles, a grade 5 crescendo-decrescendo murmur, elevated JVP, and lower extremity edema. Laboratory findings were pertinent for creatinine of 1.73, BUN of 45, and NT-pro-BNP of 10k. The rest of her physical exam and laboratory was normal. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with known left bundle branch block. 2D echocardiogram demonstrated severe aortic stenosis with mean aortic valve pressure gradient of 68.6 mmHg and peak velocity of 5.15 m/s with preserved systolic function. She received intravenous diuretics with some clinical improvement. She was seen and evaluated by cardiothoracic surgeon for evaluation of aortic valve replacement but deemed high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement with an estimated surgical mortality by Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 8.1%. Cardiac computed tomography angiography was done as part of transcatheter aortic valve replacement evaluation and showed severely calcified aortic leaflets with short and low left coronary system with coronary ostial height of 8.4 mm (Figure 1). Special attention was paid to the left coronary leaflet calcification and the short and low coronary ostium. Coronary angiography revealed 50% LAD stent restenosis, diffuse distal LCX disease, and 90% proximal RCA stenosis. A drug-eluting stent was implanted to the right coronary artery. The decision then was made to proceed with TAVI utilizing coronary protection technique during the procedure. TAVR was then undertaken from the right femoral artery through a 14F Edwards arterial sheath. Two 300 mm long Prowater wires were advanced to the LAD and LCX arteries. With rapid ventricular pacing over a long Amplatz extra stiff wire, balloon aortic valvuloplasty using an Edward 4 × 23 mm balloon with simultaneous root aortography to see how the left main flow was performed (Figure 2). There was flow compromise in the left main system to TIMI-2 flow; the wires were deformed and the large piece of calcium in the left cusp moved right over the left main coronary artery (Figure 2). We therefore made decision to place two 3.5 × 12 mm Robel bare-metal stents in the LAD and LCX. An Edward 23 mm SAPIEN 3 valve with rapid ventricular pacing was then deployed followed by deploying the two stents in a kissing fashion, and an excellent result was obtained (Figure 3). Position of the valve and function was confirmed by aortography and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The left main coronary flow was excellent. The patient tolerated the procedure well and recovered uneventfully and was discharged 2 days after the procedure without complications. At 30-day follow-up, she has notable improvement of her symptoms and physical activity with NYHA class I from class IV symptoms.TAVR is an acceptable and successful alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in high-risk patients. A rare, life-threatening complication of TAVR is a coronary ostial obstruction. Scarce clinical data is available on this important complication as it has been reported in case reports and small case series with an estimated incidence of <1% which carries a high mortality when it occurs (close to 40% at 30 days) [6]. A coronary ostial height cut-off of <10 mm increases the risk of coronary obstruction after TAVI [7, 8]. The LM protection technique should be considered in patients deemed to be at increased risk of LM compromise. It is mostly due to anatomical factors including low coronary ostia and shallow sinuses of Valsalva (SOV) and with valve in valve (VIV) for surgical bioprosthesis. LM protection should be considered in LM height of less than 9 mm, a difference of less than 2 mm between the SOV mean diameter, and the prosthesis diameter or severe aortic valve calcifications with the presence of left cusp large bulky calcium nodule(s). Preprocedural imaging and contingency planning must be utilized as it helps in the early diagnosis and treatment of coronary compromise following valve deployment. This involves preprocedural coronary angiography, EKG-gated, multislice CT angiography study with CT analysis that includes aortic annulus diameter and area, coronary height, SOV diameter, sinotubular junction (STJ) diameter, severity of aortic valve calcification, the presence of aortic valve calcium nodules (>10 mm), prosthesis size/annulus diameter ratio, and prosthesis area/annulus area ratio. Recent report of case series suggested a decision-making flow chart for the preprocedural evaluation of a patient believed to be at increased risk of LM compromise during TAVI (Figure 4) [9].The LM protection with preemptive technique is safe and feasible and should be considered in patients deemed to be at increased risk of LM compromise.This case presentation was also presented at Cardiovascular Revascularization Therapies (CRT, 2017) [10].The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Supplementary material contains the slides of the case presentation which took place at CRT meeting in Washington, D.C. on February 19th, 2017.

Pheochromocytoma, “the Great Masquerader,” Presenting as Severe Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in a Young Patient
1Division of Cardiovascular Health and Disease, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA2Division of Cardiology, Mercy Heart Institute, Cincinnati, OH, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Hans A. Reyes; moc.liamg@gseyersnahReceived 15 January 2018; Revised 18 March 2018; Accepted 16 April 2018; Published 29 April 2018Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2018 Hans A. Reyes et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 22-year-old man presented to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath, chest discomfort, sinus tachycardia, and emesis. The echocardiogram demonstrated global hypokinesis with a left ventricle ejection fraction of 15–20%. The patient was treated for acute systolic heart failure decompensation with diuresis and afterload reduction. Unexpectedly, an abdominal computed tomography showed a left adrenal mass and subsequent serum/urine metanephrine tests suggested pheochromocytoma. Once the patient had stabilized, he underwent an uneventful adrenalectomy with histology results confirming the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. After six months follow-up, he is currently doing well with close outpatient follow-up by cardiology.Pheochromocytoma, the “great masquerader,” is a neoplasm of neuroectodermal chromaffin cells which produces excess catecholamines. The classical clinical triad is described with headaches, palpitations, and sweating. However, this tumor can be asymptomatic or present with a myriad of symptoms including headaches, anxiety attacks, hypertension, and in rare cases, multiorgan failure [1–3]. These symptoms are secondary to excess catecholamines. Once diagnosed, the medical management can be further challenging. Our patient initially presented with severe cardiomyopathy and decompensated heart failure which required optimization prior to adrenalectomy.A 22-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of shortness of breath and abdominal swelling that had progressed over the previous two months. His symptoms were associated with intermittent chest discomfort and palpitations. Upon developing increased nausea, emesis, and diarrhea, he presented to the ED. The patient reported a history of hypertension and intermittent severe headaches but stated he did not seek additional evaluation or treatment. He had no history of tobacco or recreational drugs but reported occasional alcohol consumption. Initial vital signs included blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 114 bpm, respiratory rate 18 per minute, O2 sat of 99% on room air, and temperature of 98°F. The physical exam was remarkable for a jaundiced patient in mild distress with jugular venous distention, tachycardia, and S3 gallop. Electrocardiogram confirmed sinus tachycardia with anterior ST depression. Laboratory data revealed the following: WBC 9800/μL, Hb/Hct 14.5/45 g/dL, normal electrolytes, BUN/Cr 13/0.8, hepatic function was remarkable for ALT 153 mg/dL and AST 85 mg/dL, total bilirubin 3.9 mg/dL, normal coagulation profile, and troponin I < 0.01 ng/mL. The chest X-ray was notable for an enlarged cardiopericardial silhouette and prominent central pulmonary vasculature. The echocardiogram revealed severe global hypokinesis with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15–20%, apical akinesis with an organized 2.2 × 1.4 cm fixed thrombus (Figure 1), and a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated at 55 mmHg. A computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram excluded pulmonary embolism but did show cardiomegaly and a right pleural effusion. An abdominal and pelvic CT with contrast was ordered due to gastrointestinal symptoms, and unexpectedly, it showed a 4 × 3 cm enhancing mass on the left adrenal gland (Figure 2).The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure; the therapy included diuresis and afterload reduction with lisinopril, carvedilol as tolerated, and digoxin. Due to the suggestion of left ventricular thrombus by the echocardiogram, anticoagulation was initiated. A single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) stress test was done revealing severe global hypokinesis with regional variability, LVEF of 17%, and no evidence of ischemia. Incidentally, increased uptake associated with the left adrenal gland was noted. Plasma and 24-hour urine metanephrines were elevated at 11.8 nmol/L (normal value: 0–0.89 nmol/L) and 2223 μg/24 h (normal value: 0–400 μg/24 h), respectively, supporting the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Once heart failure condition was stabilized, carvedilol was switched to prazosin and metoprolol. The patient was transferred to a facility with cardiothoracic surgical support capabilities including left ventricular-assisted device and cardiac transplant prior to the planned adrenalectomy. Surgery was completed successfully with balloon pump backup and with histology results confirming the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.Subsequently, a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) performed two weeks after discharge showed moderate dilation of the left ventricle with a LVEF of 23%, diffuse hypokinesis, resolution of the intracavitary left ventricular thrombus, and a midventricular, midmyocardial linear stripe and inferior right midventricular insertion enhancement on the delayed gadolinium enhancement (DGE) (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Six months after adrenalectomy, the patient was able to return to work doing light activities four hours daily and his last echocardiogram showed an improved LVEF of 40%.Our case of a young male patient with a history of hypertension who presented with congestive heart failure highlights the importance of screening for secondary etiologies of hypertension in this population. While heart failure is uncommon in this population, the differential diagnosis includes viral myocarditis, drug-induced cardiomyopathy, familial cardiomyopathies, cardiac sarcoidosis, congenital heart disease, and, even rarer, ischemic cardiomyopathy.Our patient had a history of hypertension for two years, was noncompliant, and was lost to follow-up. His acute presentation with heart failure was initially attributed to an uncontrolled hypertension. However, during the initial work-up, an abdominal CT showed a mass in the left adrenal gland with incidental radionuclide uptake during cardiac stress testing. Based on these findings, pheochromocytoma was suspected, which was subsequently confirmed by ancillary tests and pathology.Pheochromocytoma, known as the “great masquerader,” is a neoplasm of neuroectodermal chromaffin cells which produces excess catecholamines. Its annual incidence is approximately 0.8 per 100,000 person-years and probably occurs in less than 0.5 percent of patients with hypertension [1, 2]. Pheochromocytoma can be sporadic or familial; sporadic forms are usually diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 50, while the hereditary forms present in childhood or early adulthood [3]. This tumor has varied clinical manifestations ranging from an asymptomatic subclinical picture to symptoms such as headaches, palpitations, sweating, anxiety, emesis, hypertension, and, in rare cases, multiorgan failure [4–7]. All of these symptoms are secondary to excess catecholamines. Importantly, relatively large numbers of patients are not diagnosed during their lives or are diagnosed only after the occurrence of significant cardiovascular damages [4], as with our patient.Although the majority of patients with pheochromocytoma have a normal or increased ventricular systolic function on echocardiography, the pattern of left ventricular dysfunction may be variable. Only around 10–20% of patients with pheochromocytoma present with catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy [8, 9]. When catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy is present, most of the cases demonstrate a stress-induced cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo syndrome [7, 10]. In those patients, an echocardiogram demonstrates transient left ventricular apical ballooning with midventricular dyskinesis that extends beyond the distribution of any single coronary artery. Unlike stress-induced cardiomyopathy, our patient’s echocardiogram demonstrated global hypokinesis and not apical ballooning which was initially suspected to be a consequence of occult hypertension leading to a “burned-out” ventricle.Pheochromocytomas have been associated with other various cardiovascular complications due to overwhelming catecholamine levels. The most common complications include left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemic heart disease, disturbances in rhythm and conduction, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and even shock [3, 5, 11]. The potentially fatal cardiovascular complications of these tumors are due to the potent effects of catecholamines, especially noradrenaline, the main transmitter released from sympathetic nerve terminals.According to Batisse-Lignier et al. [7], which performed a systematic review in 145 cases with either acute or chronic pheochromocytoma-induced cardiomyopathy, the LVEF recovery after surgical resection of the tumor is higher in patients who presented with stress-induced cardiomyopathy than in others who presented with catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathies (64.9% versus 40.8%, ). Even after a multivariate analysis, only stress-induced cardiomyopathy was associated with a better left ventricle recovery ().The exact mechanism of cardiomyopathy in patients with pheochromocytoma remains unclear. However, there are some mechanisms that can explain the myocardial damage associated with catecholamines. These can cause a direct toxic effect on the myocardium through calcium overload due to altered sodium and calcium transporters, enhanced lipid mobility, free radical production, or increased sarcolemmal permeability [5, 10, 12]. In addition, myocardial damage may occur secondary to a decrease in myocardial oxygen supply combined with a sustained myocardial oxygen demand [12, 13]. Usually, catecholamines bind to beta1 and beta2-adrenergic receptors and produce positive inotropic and lusitropic effects. Nevertheless, in situations of increased stress with very high levels of catecholamines, beta1-adrenergic receptors’ activation can induce apoptosis of the cardiac myocytes. Moreover, the binding of epinephrine to beta2-adrenergic receptors produces a negative inotropic effect [5, 10]. Thus, catecholamines also have a dose-dependent cardiotoxic effect.Considering the previous mechanisms of cardiac injury, the myocardial damage produced in acute or chronic exposure to catecholamines could be different. Acute catecholamine exposure, such as in stress-induced cardiomyopathy, exposes the myocardial beta receptors to an enormous amount of catecholamines leading to a stunning of the left ventricle and slight histological apoptosis. On the other hand, in chronic adrenergic exposure, it is hypothesized that the heart gets gradually used to the surge of catecholamines with desensitization of adrenergic receptors [7]. Unlike acute exposure, long-standing catecholaminergic burden leads to structural myocardial alterations such as interstitial fibrosis, inflammation, and a subsequent dysfunction [10, 13]. This chronic exposure may explain the lower level of LVEF recovery in the catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy subgroup described by Batisse-Lignier et al.Previous reports have showed that pheochromocytoma-induced cardiomyopathy can be reversed with medical therapy first followed by a subsequent tumor extirpation [4, 6–9], as with our patient. The prognosis of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy depends on early diagnosis and prompt medical and surgical treatment. Once diagnosed, the medical management of these tumors prior to surgery may be challenging in the context of heart failure [14]. The usual therapy includes initial blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors [8, 9]; beta-blockers are added after several days to ensure adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade. Beta blockers should never be administered without appropriate alpha blockade as this could worsen hypertensive episodes by exacerbating vasoconstriction while inhibiting vasodilation. Our patient had clear symptoms of decompensated heart failure on presentation, requiring reduction of both preload and afterload. Thus, we believe that the use of carvedilol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, was a rational and adequate option due to the possibility of pheochromocytoma. An alpha blocker is not a recommended treatment for heart failure, but its use in patients with pheochromocytoma is mandatory. Patients with pheochromocytoma may be intravascularly volume depleted, and diuretics should be administered with caution. However, in patients with catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy, diuretic use is warranted. Regarding ancillary tests, interpretation of metanephrine levels in the context of established cardiomyopathy is also difficult as cardiac failure of any etiology generates an adrenergic response [14]. In this particular presentation of heart failure, where the culprit is an uncommon cause, multidisciplinary management is needed, including physiologically directed pharmacologic therapy which may deviate from guidelines given the need for alpha blockers and individualized care.Our patient’s CMRI showed minimal DGE consistent with mild myocardial fibrosis or scar, which was encouraging for left ventricular functional recovery. At six months follow-up, the patient is doing well, without significant symptoms, and has shown improvement of LVEF by echocardiogram. Given his young age at presentation with pheochromocytoma, he underwent genetic testing and is continuing to be followed by endocrinology.With this case, we want to emphasize that the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma requires high clinical alertness due to its rare incidence and extremely variable clinical presentation and to highlight the relevance of considering pheochromocytoma in the differential diagnosis of unexplained cardiomyopathy in a young patient. We also want to stress the importance of routine follow-up in hypertensive patients as early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in this group of patients. Finally, once diagnosed, it is essential to closely follow these patients to monitor the LVEF and provide optimal medical management for their cardiomyopathy.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Treatment of an Unusual Occurrence of a Complex Left Subclavian Artery/Left Internal Mammary Artery Bifurcation Stenosis in the Setting of Coronary Subclavian Steal Syndrome and Ischemic Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction
1St. Peter’s Health Partners, 2 Palisades Drive, Albany, NY 12205, USA2College of Biomedical Sciences, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Michael J. Martinelli; moc.phps@illenitram.leahcimReceived 14 September 2017; Accepted 3 April 2018; Published 23 April 2018Academic Editor: Ertugrul ErcanCopyright © 2018 Michael J. Martinelli and Michael B. Martinelli. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.This case will illustrate the clinical and unique technical challenges, not previously reported, in a patient with a history of progressive left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction (MI), and a complex bifurcation lesion of the left subclavian artery (SA) involving the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) in the setting of coronary subclavian steal syndrome (CSSS). The approach to this lesion is complicated by significant LIMA involvement requiring intervention directed toward both the SA and the LIMA in the presence of severe LV systolic dysfunction. This clinical scenario necessitates a careful technique, utilizing bifurcation methods similar to those used in coronary intervention.Coronary subclavian steal syndrome (CSSS), first described in 1974, is characterized by a stenotic proximal left subclavian artery (SA) causing reversal of flow in the LIMA resulting in a “steal” phenomenon [1]. This syndrome typically presents with angina during left upper extremity exertion. Less common manifestations include acute myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic cardiomyopathy, and ventricular arrhythmias [2, 3]. The case reported here demonstrates a lesion of the proximal SA, which could be expected to result in CSSS, but which atypically involves both the LIMA and the SA beyond the LIMA. This lesion morphology not only creates a steal phenomenon but further compromises LIMA flow to the LAD by inhibiting inflow to and outflow from the LIMA. This complex anatomy may further worsen the clinical severity beyond which is typically seen in CSSS alone. Both the lesion morphology and the severity of the clinical manifestations noted in this patient increase the risk and technical difficulty of the procedure.A 75-year-old Caucasian male was referred for evaluation with the following history: coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) and sequential saphenous vein grafting (SVG) to ramus, obtuse marginal, right posterolateral and right posterior descending arteries, repeat CABG two years later with revision of the SVG, severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with a history of left lower extremity surgical revascularization, right iliac artery occlusion, atherosclerotic carotid artery disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage III. He had been hospitalized for the treatment of CHF and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) within the prior three months and continued to experience increasing angina and dyspnea on exertion (NYHA Class III), which was refractory to medications. He was noted to have had a decrease in LV ejection fraction by echocardiogram from 45% to 15% and underwent cardiac catheterization.Cardiac catheterization revealed a patent sequential SVG and severe disease of the body of the SA, distal to the left vertebral artery, and involving the LIMA (Figure 1). The lesion involved the LIMA and the SA, immediately both proximal and distal to the LIMA. Cardiac surgical consultation was obtained, and the patient was deemed a prohibitive risk for a third CABG. Vascular surgical treatment (subclavian-carotid transposition or bypass) was not an option as it would not address the compromised LIMA. Percutaneous therapy directed toward the SA/LIMA bifurcation was planned.A 6 Fr FR 4.0 Medtronic Launcher coronary guide catheter was placed via the left femoral artery (LFA) into the proximal SA, and a 6-French IMA Medtronic Launcher coronary guide catheter was placed via the left radial artery (LRA) into the SA distal to the LIMA origin. Initial attempts to cross the diffusely calcific SA stenosis anterograde via the LFA, using multiple wire sizes and tips, were unsuccessful. A 0.018 Terumo Glidewire Advantage wire was then placed retrograde via the LRA across the SA stenosis and into the ascending aorta. A 0.014 Terumo Runthrough NS Hypercoat coronary guidewire was placed from the LFA into the LIMA (Figure 2). The SA was predilated via the LRA. A 5 mm × 28 mm balloon expandable stent (Multi-Link Ultra, Abbott Vascular) was then placed into the SA crossing the ostium of the LIMA, trapping the LIMA guidewire (Figure 3). This was followed by postdilatation of the stent with a 5 mm × 15 mm noncompliant balloon (NC Trek, Abbott Vascular). A second Terumo Runthrough NS Hypercoat coronary guidewire was then placed through the stent into the LIMA from the LFA, and the trapped guidewire was removed. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made to pass a balloon through the stent struts into the LIMA from the LFA. Despite the use of small, low profile balloons and a guide extender (Guide Liner, Vascular Solutions), the LIMA could not be accessed from the LFA. At this point, the decision was made to change the angle of approach to the LIMA by attempting percutaneous intervention via the LRA.A 0.014 Terumo Runthrough NS Hypercoat coronary guidewire was then placed from the LRA through the stent struts into the LIMA. The coronary guidewire which had been placed into the LIMA from the LFA was removed. A 0.035 Terumo Glidewire Advantage wire was then placed from the LFA into the SA.The stent struts were then dilated via the LRA, and a 3 mm × 12 mm drug-eluting stent (Xience Alpine, Abbott Vascular) was easily passed through. A 5 mm × 15 mm noncompliant balloon (NC Trek, Abbott Vascular) was then placed into the SA stent via the LFA, and a small portion of the LIMA stent was pulled back into the SA stent in order to perform “T and small Protrusion” or TAP stenting [4] of the SA/LIMA bifurcation (Figure 4). A final kissing balloon angioplasty was accomplished, and post-op angiography demonstrated a patent SA/LIMA bifurcation (Figure 5).The patient was symptom free with improved LV ejection fraction to 30% by echocardiography at 6 months.Subclavian artery stenosis (SAS) is found in up to 18% of patients with PAD [5]. Proximal left SAS was found to occur in 11.8% of patients with both PAD and coronary artery disease requiring CABG [2, 6]. In patients who have undergone CABG with LIMA, the estimated incidence of CSSS is between 0.2% and 6.8% [2, 7]. Based on data from 98 case reports, the most common manifestation of CSSS is stable/unstable angina (88.6%), MI (11.4%), and CHF or worsening LV systolic dysfunction (13.2%) [8].Endovascular treatment of SAS has evolved into first-line therapy. Balloon expandable stents have been associated with low periprocedural complication rates. In addition, ten-year patency and event-free survival appear comparable to surgical treatment of SAS [2, 9].The case described is anatomically unique due to the presence of extensive atherosclerosis of the subclavian/LIMA bifurcation resulting in severe ischemia leading to progressive LV systolic dysfunction and congestive heart failure. This complex bifurcation anatomy creates not only substrate for CSSS but compromises inflow to and outflow from the LIMA, likely compounding the severity of the LAD territory ischemia causing significant cardiac compromise [10].The lesion was classified as a Medina 1,1,1 bifurcation type (Figure 6) using the Medina classification for coronary bifurcations [11]. In this case, the SA was considered the main branch (MB) and the LIMA the side branch (SB), and the procedure was planned accordingly.Accessing the lesion from both the proximal and distal SA (MB) provided a unique approach to bifurcation stenting, which is not available in the coronary tree. The decision to utilize a two-stent technique was based on the large size of the SB (LIMA) with disease extending greater than 5 mm from the carina into the SB [12]. The “T and small protrusion” or TAP technique was the chosen bifurcation technique [4]. The “crush” bifurcation technique has been reported in SA/vertebral artery bifurcation stenoses [13]; however, the technically less demanding TAP technique was chosen based on lesion complexity and difficult lesion access [4]. Also, the near ninety-degree angle of the bifurcation favors the TAP technique [12]. It should be noted that despite the high-risk nature of the intervention, mechanical support was not utilized. This patient had significant bilateral lower extremity PAD, including a totally occluded right iliac artery making the use of support devices problematic. This case illustrates a severe clinical manifestation of CSSS and LIMA compromise secondary to a complex bifurcation stenosis. As demonstrated, with careful planning and the meticulous use of bifurcation techniques adapted from the coronary experience, a procedure of this nature can be performed safely and with an excellent outcome.Michael J.

Postural Tachycardia Syndrome and Vasovagal Syncope: A Hidden Case of Obstructive Cardiomyopathy without Severe Septal Hypertrophy
1Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Heart and Vascular Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA2Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Kenneth A. Mayuga; gro.fcc@kaguyamReceived 3 January 2018; Accepted 27 March 2018; Published 16 April 2018Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2018 Kenneth A. Mayuga et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 36-year-old female with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and syncope was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope on a tilt table test and with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) after a repeat tilt table test. However, an echocardiogram at our institution revealed obstructive cardiomyopathy without severe septal hypertrophy, with a striking increase in left ventricular outflow tract gradient from 7 mmHg at rest to 75 mmHg during Valsalva, with a septal thickness of only 1.3 cm. Cardiac MRI showed an apically displaced multiheaded posteromedial papillary muscle with suggestion of aberrant chordal attachments to the anterior mitral leaflet contributing to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. She underwent surgery with reorientation of the posterior medial papillary muscle head, resection of the tethering secondary chordae to the A1 segment of the mitral valve, chordal shortening and tacking of the chordae to the A1 and A2 segments of the mitral valve, and gentle septal myectomy. After surgery, she had significant improvement in her prior symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of obstructive cardiomyopathy without severe septal hypertrophy with abnormalities in papillary muscle and chordal attachment, in a patient diagnosed with vasovagal syncope and POTS.Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by frequent symptoms that occur with standing, an increase in heart rate of 30 bpm when moving from a recumbent to a standing position, and the absence of orthostatic hypotension [1]. Vasovagal syncope is defined as syncope that usually occurs with upright posture held for more than 30 seconds, features diaphoresis, warmth, nausea, and pallor, and is associated with hypotension and relative bradycardia [1]. Obstructive cardiomyopathy without severe septal hypertrophy (OCM), such as from papillary muscle abnormalities or abnormal chordal attachment, can lead to a decrease in cardiac output due to obstruction in the left ventricular outflow tract. To our knowledge, OCM from papillary muscle abnormalities and abnormal chordal attachment has not previously been reported in a patient diagnosed with POTS as well as vasovagal syncope.A 36-year-old female was referred to our institution for evaluation of symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. Consent was obtained from the patient to publish this as a case report, with documentation of verbal consent in the electronic medical record. She reported symptoms including dizziness, palpitations, nausea, and a warm sensation while upright that improved with assuming a recumbent posture. She also reported symptoms during exertion, documented as lightheadedness and feeling of her heart racing when physically active, as well as a decreased tolerance to walking. Her symptoms occurred a few times per week up to several times per day and were worse during the beginning of her menstrual cycle. Her symptoms significantly improved with wearing compression stockings. She also reported two episodes of loss of consciousness. With the first episode, she was lying on the couch then sat up and felt nauseated, and then she stood up and had an abrupt loss of consciousness. With the second episode, she was walking in the kitchen, had a brief prodrome of not feeling well, and then had an abrupt loss of consciousness. She had evaluations at an outside institution with a Holter monitor showing episodes of sinus tachycardia, an echocardiogram that was reportedly normal, and a tilt table test reporting a vasovagal reaction following the administration of nitroglycerin. She reported that her father had multiple episodes of syncope but never sought medical treatment; she did not report any family history of POTS.She underwent further evaluations at our institution. A passive 70-degree head up tilt table test showed a postural increase in heart rate from 74 to 114 bpm at the end of the tilt, with some blood pressure oscillations but overall stable blood pressures (from 115/70 mmHg supine to 118/82 mmHg at the end of tilt) while eliciting her typical symptoms of nausea, warmth, a spinning sensation, and feeling like she would lose consciousness. She requested the test to be stopped early at 36 minutes out of a 45-minute protocol due to her symptoms. Of note, she was taking fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily at the time of the head up tilt table test. She was diagnosed initially with POTS due to her clinical features and tilt table test results. She underwent blood volume and hemodynamic testing. Blood volume measured using a I-131-HSA-tagged human serum albumin technique with a Daxor BVA-100 system (Daxor Corporation, NY, USA) showed normal plasma volume at −2.8% from ideal (gender matched, weight, and height). Hemodynamic testing to assess circulatory kinetics was done using 99 m Technetium-RBC radionuclide imaging [2]. At 45-degree head up position, the heart rate increased by 18 bpm, cardiopulmonary volume fraction decreased by 34% (a marked decrease), cardiac index decreased from 2.6 L/min/m2 to 1.777 L/min/m2, stroke volume decreased from 79 ml to 50 ml, total peripheral resistance increased from 40 to 61 m2, and mean pulmonary transit time was rapid at 6.8 seconds. Plasma metanephrine and normetanephrine levels were checked and were within normal limits. An evaluation of autonomic function was done. Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing showed normal values at the right forearm, proximal leg, distal leg, and foot. The heart rate and blood pressure responses to Valsalva showed a normal Valsalva ratio of 1.47 and normal blood pressure responses in phase II and phase IV. An exercise treadmill test done as part of the evaluation for cardiac rehabilitation showed fair functional capacity at 8.6 METS, an increase in heart rate to 99% of maximal predicted heart rate, stable blood pressures, and no arrhythmias.A resting echocardiogram repeated at our institution showed a normal EF of 71%, mild septal left ventricular hypertrophy measuring 1.3 cm, with a prominent posterior papillary muscle. At rest, there was chordal systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve with trivial mitral regurgitation, and a left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of only 7 mmHg. After Valsalva maneuver, the LVOT gradient increased strikingly to 75 mmHg (Figure 1) with a further increase to 81 mmHg after administration of amyl nitrite. A subsequent cardiac MRI demonstrated an apically displaced, multiheaded posteromedial papillary muscle. There was a suggestion that the more anteriorly displaced head of the posteromedial papillary muscle had aberrant chordal attachments to the anterior mitral valve leaflet that contributed to the SAM (Figure 2). There was mild hypertrophy of the anteroseptum (measuring 1.3 cm) with a normal left ventricular mass index of 57 gm/m2 (normal 48–77 gm/m2) and no delayed enhancement to suggest interstitial fibrosis. A subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) demonstrated the mobile anteriorly displaced posterior papillary muscle with SAM (Figure 3).After consultations with specialists in structural heart disease and cardiothoracic surgery, the patient ultimately underwent cardiac surgery consisting of very gentle septal myectomy focusing more midventricular at the basilar septum, reorientation of the posterior medial papillary muscle head, resection of the tethering secondary chordae to the A1 segment of the mitral valve, and chordal shortening and tacking of the chordae to the A1 and A2 segments of the mitral valve. During her several post-op visits with Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery, she reported a significant improvement in her prior orthostatic symptoms and no longer reported syncope.Obstructive cardiomyopathy without severe septal hypertrophy, for example, from papillary muscle abnormalities or abnormal chordal attachment, is not as recognized as the more widely known hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with severe septal hypertrophy (HOCM) but can also lead to symptoms due to left ventricular outflow obstruction and decreased cardiac output. In the case presented, the patient underwent typical evaluations for a patient with orthostatic symptoms, syncope, and POTS, with expected findings on the initial evaluations, including a tilt table test. Typically, echocardiograms are done while the patient is at rest and without provocative maneuvers such as Valsalva or amyl nitrite unless a resting LVOT gradient is seen. Therefore, entities such as OCM can be readily underdiagnosed. The repeat echocardiogram at our institution disclosed no significant LVOT gradient at rest, but it did reveal a prominent posterior papillary muscle and mild septal hypertrophy. Valsalva maneuver demonstrated significant obstruction across the LVOT, with similar findings after administration of amyl nitrite, a vasodilator agent. The patient also underwent additional cardiac imaging with TEE and MRI that demonstrated the apically displaced, multiheaded posteromedial papillary muscle with SAM. Initial treatment with a beta-blocker can be considered to slow the heart rate and enhance left ventricular filling, but in some cases surgical correction is considered, as in this case. The diagnosis and treatment of obstructive cardiomyopathy without severe hypertrophy (≤1.8 cm) has recently been reported from our institution [3]. On multivariate analysis, the predictors of maximal LVOT gradient included bifid papillary muscle mobility and abnormal chordal attachment to the base of the anterior mitral leaflet. In terms of management, it is important to differentiate patients with OCM as opposed to HOCM. As opposed to the surgical treatment of HOCM, which involves myectomy to relieve obstruction, performing myectomy in patients with OCM may not effectively relieve the obstruction. Patel et al. [3] showed that >50% of the patients with OCM required a non-myectomy approach to optimally relieve LV outflow tract obstruction, such as with papillary muscle reorientation. Newer techniques such as this have an added benefit of decreasing the need for mitral valve replacement for these patients.In this case, given the venous pooling found on hemodynamic testing, a decrease in venous return to the heart with upright posture can provoke or worsen an LVOT gradient, resulting in reduced cardiac output, and subsequently causing symptoms. The hemodynamic testing indeed showed a decrease in the cardiac index when the patient was tilted to 45 degrees, even with an increase in the heart rate, due to a decrease in stroke volume. This may help explain the significant benefit that this patient derived from wearing lower extremity compression stockings with the limiting of venous pooling. Overall, this case illustrates the importance of maintaining a high degree of suspicion when assessing for cardiac etiologies, including considering the use of provocative maneuvers or multimodality cardiac imaging, in patients with otherwise presumed typical POTS and vasovagal syncope. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of obstructive cardiomyopathy without severe septal hypertrophy with abnormalities in papillary muscle and chordal attachment, in a patient diagnosed with POTS and vasovagal syncope.The authors report no relevant disclosures or conflicts of interest.
Ranolazine for Angina in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
1Department of Internal Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ, USA2Department of Cardiology, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Akhtar Amin; ku.oc.evil@nima.rathkaReceived 22 February 2018; Accepted 29 March 2018; Published 15 April 2018Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2018 Akhtar Amin and Bernard Kim. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Ranolazine is an antianginal and works by inhibiting late-sodium current (INaL). However, its use is limited mostly to patients with coronary artery disease. However, literature has shown its potential benefit in relieving angina in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hereby, we discuss two cases where ranolazine led to improvement in angina refractory to beta-blockers. In conclusion, ranolazine can be considered as a potential antianginal drug in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy refractory to beta-blockers.Ranolazine is a novel antianginal drug which was approved by FDA a decade ago [1]. At the time of its approval, the mechanism of action of ranolazine was unknown [1]. Furthermore, the antianginal effect of ranolazine was mostly studied in patients with coronary artery disease [2, 3].In 2012, AHA/ACC published its guidelines for treatment of stable angina in patients with coronary artery disease, which included a class IIa recommendation stating ranolazine as a second-line therapeutic agent [4].However, over the past decade, our understanding of ranolazine has developed significantly. It has been established that ranolazine acts a late sodium current (INaL) inhibitor. Its role in decreasing diastolic myocardial wall tension and subsequently increasing the coronary blood flow during diastole has been studied [5]. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a new clinical ground where ranolazine has shown promising results in terms of its antianginal effects [6].We hereby discuss two cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with angina refractory to beta-blockers, where ranolazine led to improvement in symptoms.A 31-year-old female, with a known diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, presented to the ED with intermittent chest pain despite being on metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed marked septal hypertrophy with a resting outflow gradient of 80 mmHg. After ruling out other possibilities, diagnosis of chronic stable angina was made. She was discharged after an increase in beta-blocker dosage and was followed up as an outpatient. The patient returned to the ED the next year with similar symptoms. Left heart catheterization showed normal coronaries, and the patient was started on ranolazine, which was titrated up to ranolazine 1000 mg BID as an outpatient. Symptoms improved significantly on combination of metoprolol and ranolazine.A 49-year-old male, with no past medical history, presented to the ED with exertional SOB and episode of lightheadedness. TTE showed severe left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with impingement of the septum into left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) with significant LVOT obstruction and a potential intracavitary gradient >100 mmHg. Left cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries. Thus, a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was made. He was discharged on metoprolol 25 mg TID. The patient was seen as an outpatient where he complained of anginal symptoms. Provided his heart rate was in low 60 s, he was started on ranolazine 500 mg BID, which was titrated up to 1000 mg BID on the subsequent visit. The patient reported significantly improved symptoms on the combination of metoprolol and ranolazine.Ranolazine is an effective antianginal therapy for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a very commonly inherited cardiac disorder, with prevalence of 1 in 500 in general population [7]. Chest pain-like angina is a very frequent presenting symptom of HCM and has been postulated to be due to microvascular ischemia [7]. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers have been effective in managing angina in HCM. However, for patients with symptoms refractory to these medications, ranolazine is an effective therapy.Coppini et al. [5] demonstrated an increased density of INaL in cardiac myocytes isolated from patients with HCM. INaL is a persistent slow influx of sodium ions throughout the action potential of cardiac myocyte. This persistent influx is due to the delayed inactivation of the sodium channel. An increase in intracellular sodium leads to increased intracellular calcium via decreased activity of energy-requiring Na-Ca exchanger (NCX), and in some cases, even via reverse flow through the NCX [8].An increase in intracellular calcium level, in turn, leads to increased tension in the LV myocardial wall which contributes to diastolic dysfunction [8]. This worsening diastolic dysfunction increases left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) which, in turn, decreases the coronary flow gradient; and ultimately a decrease in the blood supply to the myocardium is observed.Coppini et al. also demonstrated lengthening of action potential duration (APD) in cardiac myocytes of HCM patients, also indicatively increased intracytosolic calcium. They successfully reported the in vivo effect of ranolazine in shortening of APD.This consolidates that ranolazine’s function as a late sodium current (INaL) inhibitor and prevents the increase in intracytosolic calcium, ultimately increasing the blood supply to the myocardium and relieving anginal symptoms.A study by Gentry et al. [6] assessed the efficacy of ranolazine in relieving anginal symptoms refractory to maximum tolerated medical therapy in HCM. Among the patients that successfully completed the study, a significant reduction in anginal symptoms was reported with addition of ranolazine.Although it requires further assessment by randomized-controlled trials, ranolazine can be considered as a possible antianginal therapy in HCM patients with symptoms refractory to beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

Intoxication with these substances can induce silent but significant electrocardiographic signs which may lead to sudden death. In this case study, we present a 49-year-old male with no medical comorbidities who came to the emergency department requesting opioid detoxification. Toxicology screen was positive for cocaine, heroin, and cannabis. Initial electrocardiogram (EKG) showed features of a Brugada pattern in the right precordial leads, which resolved within one day into admission. This presentation is consistent with the recently recognized clinical entity known as Brugada phenocopy.The Brugada electrocardiographic pattern (BEP) is a coved-type, downsloping, ≥2 mm ST segment elevation with T-wave inversion among the right precordial leads V1-V2 (occasionally only in V1 and unusually also in V3) termed type 1 BEP, or a saddle-back convex ST segment elevation with variable T wave in V1, and positive or flat T wave in lead V2 (types 2 or 3 BEP) [1]. Initial guidelines required documented, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, a family history of sudden cardiac death (≤45 years old), coved-type electrocardiograms in family members, syncope, or nocturnal agonal respiration in addition to the type 1 BEP for a diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BrS) [2–4]. The latest guidelines, nonetheless, only require the documentation of type 1 BEP, either spontaneously or as a consequence of a provocative test with sodium channel blockers for a diagnosis of BrS [5].A 49-year-old Hispanic man presented to our institution requesting opioid detoxification. He had no specific clinical complaints, and the review of systems was negative. The patient’s physical examination was unremarkable. Initial workup revealed normal complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and renal and hepatic function; a urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine, opioid, and cannabinoid use.An electrocardiogram obtained on admission (Figure 1(a)) revealed a Brugada pattern which was not present on previous studies. He was monitored on a telemetry unit, and a repeat electrocardiogram the morning after showed complete resolution of the Brugada-type abnormalities (Figure 1(b)). On targeted interrogation, he denied any syncopal episodes and he had not been informed of nocturnal breathing abnormalities by his partner; there had been no sudden, unexplained deaths in his family. The patient’s parents were contacted, and their electrocardiograms were found to be normal. Since the patient’s electrocardiogram was not completely normal, he was referred to an affiliated tertiary institution for provocative testing with sodium channel blockers; however, he did not follow-up. Multiple attempts to convince the patient to undergo further workup were unsuccessful. Five months later, he was readmitted to the observation unit of our institution for evaluation of cocaine-associated chest pain. The urine toxicology screen was again positive for cocaine, opioid, and cannabinoid use. His admission electrocardiogram revealed recurrence of the Brugada pattern (Figure 2(a)), which resolved after 24 hours (Figure 2(b)). Both a transthoracic echocardiogram and a stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy were normal. Once more, he declined further workup. The patient was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable at the time of hospital discharge.BrS is an autosomal dominant, low-penetrance disease caused by several different loss-of-function gene mutations that affect the Nav1.5 sodium channel [6]. In addition, mutations causing loss of function of the calcium channel currents and a gain of function of potassium channel currents have also been associated with BrS [7]. These genetic abnormalities are thought to induce defective depolarization and/or early repolarization [8, 9], which lead to the clinical manifestations of BrS: life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.Not all patients with BrS, however, become symptomatic [6], which has led to recommendations regarding risk stratification [7]. Moreover, BEP has been reported in association to several acute and persistent conditions: acute coronary events, pericarditis, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, metabolic disorders, electrolyte imbalances, dissecting aorta aneurysm, thiamine deficiency, electric shock, certain pharmacologic agents, left ventricular hypertrophy, athlete’s heart, right bundle branch block, pectus excavatum, septal hypertrophy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy or dysplasia, autonomic nervous system abnormalities, Duchenne dystrophy, Friedreich’s ataxia, mediastinal tumor, and Chagas disease [7, 10].Recently, the term “Brugada phenocopy” (BrP) has been used to describe these cases, provided they fulfill the following criteria: there is an identifiable trigger, BEP resolves after removal of said trigger (when possible), and the results of a provocative test with sodium channel blockers are negative [10]. Patients with BrP would be classified morphologically according to the type of BEP and further qualified depending on whether all diagnostic criteria are met [10, 11]. The term is still controversial, as it has been argued that data regarding a genetic predisposition are lacking in almost all cases [7]. We believe it is a helpful descriptor to identify patients with a lower risk of developing the feared complications of BrS that would warrant invasive therapeutics.Both cannabis and cocaine have been associated with BrP [12–14], possibly due to their activities on the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel [14, 15]. The EKG changes seen with cannabis use are a result of its action as a partial agonist of the cardiac sodium channels, and arrhythmias can be induced if the action potential is shortened [12, 13, 15]. Cocaine, on the other hand, blocks sodium and potassium ion channels and also inhibits calcium entry into the cardiac myocytes thereby impairing action potential and altering the normal electrical activity of the heart [9, 16]. A synergistic effect is observed by coingestion of the above two drugs since cannabis increases the plasma concentration of cocaine [16]. Heroin has also been associated with BEP, though the exact cardiovascular mechanism remains to be described [16, 17]. A combination of the effects of these substances likely triggered the appearance of BEP in our patient. Unlike in symptomatic patients, individuals with drug-induced Brugada EKG pattern who are asymptomatic generally have good prognosis (i.e., there is a low risk of lethal arrhythmias), and the observed EKG changes is likely to be benign [9, 18]. Therefore, the need for provocative testing in these groups of patients might be unwarranted but reasonable to pursue when feasible with due considerations given to the risks and benefits [11, 18].This presentation of highly suspected BrP in the setting of cocaine, cannabinoid, and heroin use continues to raise the alarm about the cardiovascular effects of these substances. Although the clinical implications of BrP remain to be elucidated, genetic testing may help in differentiating BrP from BrS and thus with managing these patients.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.All authors had access to the case and participated in the elaboration of this manuscript.
Complex Recanalization of Chronic Total Occluison Supported by Minimal Extracorporeal Circulation in a Patient with an Aortic Valve Bioprothesis in Extraanatomic Position

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of chronic total occlusion (CTO) still remains a major challenge in interventional cardiology. This case describes a complex PCI of the left main coronary artery and of a CTO of the right coronary artery using a minimal extracorporeal circulation system (MECC) in a patient with an aortic valve bioprothesis in extraanatomic position. It illustrates that complex recanalization strategies can be solved combining it with mechanical circulatory support technologies.Recanalization of chronic total occlusion (CTO) remains a complex procedure in interventional cardiology. CTO of a coronary artery can be identified in up to 20% among patients with a clinical indication for coronary angiography. With the advent of novel recanalization techniques and emerging devices, percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) have become a promising treatment option for these patients [1–5].The minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC) system (Maquet, Hirrlingen, Germany) is a preconnected closed system with a centrifugal pump and a membrane oxygenator. It is a tip-to-tip heparin coated system which needs less than 500 ml priming volume. Venous blood returns through active drainage with a centrifugal pump instead of a roller pump to a membrane diffusion oxygenator. Venous reservoir and cardiotomy suction of shed blood is not necessary [6]. We report a case of complex coronary recanalizations using the MECC support in a patient with a calcified coronary artery disease.We present a case of a 66-year-old woman with advanced coronary artery disease (CAD). In 2013, she underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with an IMA bypass to the left anterior descending (LAD) and implantation of an aortic valve bioprothesis in extraanatomic position with a conduit from the apex of the left ventricle to the descending aorta for treatment of a symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. This procedure was chosen as a “porcelain” aorta did not allow an implantation in a regular position.Due to recurrent angina pectoris (CCS III) and dyspnoe (NYHA III), a coronary angiography was performed exhibiting an occlusion of the IMA bypass graft, a high-grade stenosis of the left main coronary artery (LCA) and a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the right coronary artery (RCA).Transoesophageal and transthoracal echocardiography revealed a reduced left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 45% with mild hypokinesia of the inferior wall. The function of the bioprothesis was regular. This was also confirmed by magnet resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart. The prothesis was positioned 8 cm distal in the conduit (Figures 1 and 2).The local heart team decided to perform a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the left main coronary artery and a PCI of the RCA-CTO assisted by a MECC system.Before starting the procedure, anesthesia and mechanical ventilation were installed. To prevent thrombembolic complications, heparin was given during the interventions guided by the activated clotting time (>300 sec). To introduce the minimal extracorporeal circulation system, an arterial 14 French and a venous 21 French access were established. Following a loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel, a 7F JL4 guiding catheter was advanced to the left main coronary artery, and 0.014” floppy guide wires were introduced into the LAD, left circumflex artery (LCX), and ramus intermedius.The left main coronary artery was stented in the direction of the LAD and LCX using the mini-crush technique; a 2.75 × 15 mm and a 3.5 × 23 mm drug-eluting stent (DES) were deployed at 18 and 20 atmospheres, respectively (Figure 3).After two failed antegrade attempts in the past, the retrograde CTO technique was applied to recanalize the RCA. For recanalization, a Sion wire (Asahi Intecc, Japan) and a Corsair microcatheter (Asahi Intecc, Japan) were used. Wire and microcatheter passed the occluded segment, and after multiple balloon dilatations, a 3.5 × 38 mm DES was implanted (Figure 4). After the procedure, we checked the result with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). A dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of 100 mg of aspirin once daily and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily for at least 6 months was continued. Artificial ventilation was stopped on the same day, and the patient could leave the hospital five days later.The MECC system has been introduced in clinical practice in 1999. Initially, it was applied in aortic valve surgery as well as in other cardiac surgical procedures [7, 8].Complex interventional procedures like PCI of the left main or of the CTO often require a hemodynamic support. The advantages of the MECC system in comparison to other mechanical circulatory support technologies like the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) are an immediate hemodynamic stabilization and additional support by unloading the right ventricle [9]. As a potential alternative, the Impella CP microaxial pump (Abiomed, USA) has been introduced. Several trials have shown before that cardiac survival was higher in patients with complete revascularization when compared to patients with incomplete revascularization [10, 11].Our case demonstrates that by combining advanced recanalization techniques and the MECC system complex, coronary conditions which are so far considered as intractable by interventional means can be treated successfully. The combination of both, high-standard CTO-PCI and an extracorporeal circulation support system, allows us to pursue the interventional procedure. A profound knowledge and a confident command of CTO techniques are required for this kind of intervention. Nevertheless, a strong cooperation between interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons is still necessary as part of the heart team [12].The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.
Endovascular Repair of Aortobronchial Fistula after Bentall Procedure

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Aortobronchial fistula (ABF) is a rare complication of aortic repair seen with both surgical and endovascular manipulation. The available literature largely refers to the need for surgical repair. We are not aware of any reports of endovascular repair after the Bentall procedure. This report describes a patient who after the Bentall procedure presented with massive hemoptysis from ABF, a multidisciplinary team decided on endovascular repair due to patient frailty to avoid redo sternotomy. We believe this is the first case report of endovascular repair and represents the success of multidisciplinary collaboration.Aortobronchial fistula (ABF) is a rare complication after endovascular or surgical manipulation. Available literature has suggested that thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) may be an option for selected patients [1]; however, the data have been limited to case reports and series, none of which to our knowledge were in patients after the Bentall procedure. Therapy for these patients previously has been restricted to redo sternotomy and aortic repair with high morbidity and mortality. The complex aortic disease seen in a patient with prior aortic graft and degeneration with fistula formation represents a significant number of unknowns compared to TEVAR in native aorta for which there is significant experience, such as whether it would be technically feasible, without the need for adjunctive anchoring for endoseal. Long-term durability is also unknown, but the desire to avoid the high morbidity and mortality of emergent redo sternotomy in a frail patient drove the team. We hereby present such a case.A 66-year-old Caucasian female presented to an outlying emergency department (ED) for one-hour history of massive hemoptysis. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was performed demonstrating pseudoaneurysmal degeneration of the aortic graft and fistulous flow to the right upper lobe (RUL) bronchus (Figure 1).She had a known history of Bentall repair with mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) on warfarin for approximately 17 months prior, with concurrent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) × 1. Her past medical history was otherwise significant for noncompliance, non-oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, current tobacco abuse, hypothyroidism, major depressive disorder, and past history of intravenous drug abuse. Other surgical history includes lumbar laminectomy and hysterectomy. Her home medications included tiotropium, warfarin, amlodipine, olmesartan, carvedilol, simvastatin, levothyroxine, fluticasone/salmeterol, and escitalopram.The INR (1.72) was reversed with administration of vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at the outlying ED, and she was transferred for cardiothoracic (CT) surgical evaluation. Surgery promptly involved interventional cardiology (IC) and pulmonary/critical care medicine (PCCM). Bronchosocpy revealed concordant right upper lobe (RUL) hemorrhage for which epinephrine was unable to cessate the bleeding.With ongoing blood loss and hemoglobin drop from 13.5 g/dl to 10.4 g/dl and the desire to avoid redo sternotomy, the decision to attempt multidisciplinary TEVAR was selected. After administration of general anesthesia, CT surgery performed exposure of the left subclavian artery, subsequently interventional cardiology cannulated the left subclavian artery with the modified Seldinger technique and a 6 Fr sheath was placed with advancement of a marker pigtail catheter and angiographic assessment for landing zones (Figure 2).The sheath was subsequently upsized over an Amplatz superstiff wire for an 18 Fr sheath. Based on CTA and invasive angiographic findings, a 36 mm diameter × 45 mm length Gore aortic extension cuff was selected. It was deployed satisfactorily, and then, a Gore Q50 compliant aortic occlusion balloon was used for postdilatation.Repeat angiographic assessment revealed cessation of flow into the pseudoaneurysmal/fistulous segment (Figure 3). Subsequent CTA again showed cessation of flow. Given concern for the respiratory flora colonization of the now atretic fistulous tract, the patient was placed on empiric IV antibiotic therapy for six weeks. The patient did well and was discharged home.Aortobronchial fistula has been previously described as a rare cause of hemoptysis after prior aortic operative/endovascular manipulation [2]. Historically, this was thought to only be correctable operatively otherwise felt to be uniformly fatal [3].Even with operative intervention, there was significantly high operative morality for the emergent redo sternotomy, where the retrospective series reported 20% [4].TEVAR for ABF has been around since 1996 [5] More recent limited case series have suggested that TEVAR may be a viable option for ABF [6], in fact, one series by Jonker et al. suggested it may be the preferred strategy for ABF, with low operative mortality (3%) and low need for operative intervention in the first 30 days after TEVAR (3%) [7].Colonization and infection of the endograft via the ABF of respiratory flora is a concern, where staged repair and pulmonary resection may be an option to minimize this risk if TEVAR is to be considered. [8].With the limited frequency of ABF, which has not been well defined, there are no guidelines for the use of TEVAR versus conventional operative repair. Similarly, there does not appear to be a consensus on what may be appropriate antibiotic therapy for these individuals, though some have advocated a regimen similar to uncomplicated endocarditis, six weeks of broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics followed by lifelong oral suppressant therapy [7]. For frankly infected grafts, surgical explantation with in situ reconstruction, or extra-anatomic bypass for high-risk patients has been shown to be feasible [8].Many factors drove the decision to attempt TEVAR for our patients with ABF; first, we were fortunate enough to have a relatively stable presentation where we had time to take a multidisciplinary approach. The surgeon who performed her Bentall/CABG wanted to avoid the morbidity and mortality of emergent redo sternotomy. Finally, the patient relative frailty and the favorable anatomic position of the ABF (3 cm above the sinotubular junction and 4 cm below the brachiocephalic artery) undoubtedly made it feasible.We believe that this is the first case report of TEVAR for ABF after Bentall. Caution should be taken in selecting an appropriate patient anatomy, factoring in comfort of the operators including multidisciplinary team evaluation depending on endovascular expertise and device as well as operative comfort for a rescue if emergent operative conversion becomes necessary.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Delayed Development of Coronary Ostial Stenosis following Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement: A Case Report of Unusual Presentation
1Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine, Tampa, FL, USA2Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine, Tampa, FL, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Xavier Prida; ude.fsu.htlaeh@adirpreivaxReceived 2 November 2017; Revised 11 February 2018; Accepted 12 March 2018; Published 1 April 2018Academic Editor: Gianluca Di BellaCopyright © 2018 Doosup Shin et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Coronary ostial stenosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication that occurs in 1%–5% of patients who undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Symptoms typically appear within the first 6 months and almost always within a year after SAVR. We report an unusually delayed presentation of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction due to coronary ostial stenosis 22 months after SAVR. A 71-year-old woman underwent uncomplicated SAVR with a bioprosthetic valve in August 2015 for severe aortic stenosis. A preoperative coronary angiogram demonstrated widely patent left and right coronary arteries. In June 2017, the patient presented to the hospital with chest pain. An electrocardiogram demonstrated 1 mm ST segment depression in the anterolateral leads, and serum troponin I level was elevated to 2.3 ng/ml. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed severe ostial stenosis (99%) of the right coronary artery. A bare-metal stent was successfully placed with an excellent angiographic result, and the patient was asymptomatic at 4 months of follow-up after the procedure. As seen in our case, coronary ostial stenosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain or arrhythmia in patients presenting with a history of SAVR, even if the procedure was performed more than 1 year prior to presentation.Coronary ostial stenosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication associated with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). It has been reported to occur in 1%–5% of all patients who undergo the procedure [1–5]. Coronary ostial stenosis can present with diverse clinical symptoms ranging from angina to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and even sudden cardiac death [4]. These symptoms typically appear within the first 6 months after SAVR and have rarely been identified beyond 1 year after surgery. We report an unusually delayed clinical presentation that developed 22 months after SAVR.The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe aortic stenosis who underwent SAVR in August 2015. A preoperative coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries without evidence of ostial obstruction. SAVR was successfully performed using a 23 mm diameter Magna bioprosthetic valve. During the surgery, antegrade cardioplegia was first administered to achieve electromechanical arrest. From this point, a dose of cold blood retrograde cardioplegia was administered to the coronary sinus every 15 minutes. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and had returned to her usual lifestyle. A postoperative echocardiogram demonstrated a normal ejection fraction and a normally functioning bioprosthetic aortic valve with a mean gradient of 8–10 mmHg across the valve. The patient had been compliant with medications, including aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker. In June 2017, the patient presented with pressure-like exertional chest pain. An electrocardiogram demonstrated 1 mm ST segment depression in leads I, aVL, V2, and V3 (Figure 1). Laboratory investigations revealed elevation of the serum troponin I level to 2.3 ng/ml (normal value: less than 0.032 ng/ml). Guideline-directed medical therapy for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was begun, and the patient was assigned to an invasive strategy. Diagnostic coronary angiography demonstrated isolated severe ostial stenosis (99%) of the right coronary artery with significant catheter pressure waveform dampening but no evidence of thrombus (Figure 2). It showed dramatically tapered appearance from what appeared to be normal arterial segment to a critical ostial stenosis. The lesion was less likely a catheter-induced spasm because (1) there was no direct catheter engagement or deep intubation of the vessel and (2) it persisted despite bolus administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin as well as continuous intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin prior to and during the procedure. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) could not be considered due to severity of the stenosis. The lesion was successfully treated using balloon dilations and a single 4.5 mm × 13 mm bare-metal stent (BMS) with excellent angiographic result (Figure 3). The patient was discharged from the hospital the next day without acute complications and was asymptomatic at 4 months of follow-up after the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).In 1967, Roberts and Morrow first described coronary ostial stenosis as a complication of SAVR [6]. It has been reported as a rare but potentially lethal complication following SAVR. Its prevalence has been reported in 1%–5% of patients who undergo SAVR [1–5]. Coronary ostial stenosis secondary to SAVR more commonly affects the left main coronary artery (LMCA) but also affects the right coronary artery [5]. Clinical syndromes include stable angina, ACS, ventricular arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death [4]. These clinical syndromes typically occur within the first 6 months after SAVR. Rarely has coronary ostial stenosis been identified in a patient more than one year after SAVR. To our knowledge, only one study has reported such a case [3]. Our patient represents one of the latest clinical presentations of coronary ostial stenosis occurred 22 months following SAVR.Several different underlying mechanisms have been suggested to explain the development of this disease entity. In most cases, it has been attributed to the use of ostial cannulation for antegrade cardioplegia during surgery, which can cause a mechanical injury to the coronary ostium resulting in hyperplastic reaction and stenosis [5, 7, 8]. Furthermore, infusion pressure of the cardioplegic solution administered through the cannulation catheter may also contribute to this mechanical injury [9]. However, coronary ostial stenosis can develop after SAVR even without cannulation [10], and brief cannulation times with intermittent infusion of antegrade cardioplegic solution did not eliminate the risk [4, 11]. Similarly, in our case, only a dose of antegrade cardioplegia was given to achieve initial electromechanical arrest, and then, retrograde cardioplegia was used throughout the surgery. Therefore, other mechanisms might also play a role in the development of coronary ostial stenosis after SAVR. First, turbulent flow around the prosthetic valve can cause intimal thickening and fibrous proliferation near the aortic root resulting in ostial stenosis [4–7, 10, 11]. Second, an immunological reaction to the bioprosthetic aortic valve can be another possible mechanism [12, 13]. One study supported this immunological hypothesis by using IVUS which demonstrated a massive extravascular fibrosis and its extrinsic compression around the ostium of the coronary artery causing severe ostial stenosis after SAVR [13].Revascularization alternatives for ostial coronary artery stenosis following SAVR include coronary artery bypass graft and PCI. Availability/selection of appropriate management strategies for ostial coronary artery stenosis, particularly unprotected LMCA disease, remains a controversial subject. With technological advancement, PCI and stent placement can successfully treat coronary ostial stenosis with good early and late outcomes [5, 7, 12, 14–17]. This approach was applied in our patient with good short-term outcomes. We chose the BMS over the drug-eluting stent (DES) due to its good radial strength and tightness of the lesion in the setting of a large vessel diameter. This anatomic consideration should be balanced with the risk of restenosis, especially in the aortocoronary ostial lesions. At the same time, the patient’s characteristics and the risk of bleeding should also be considered when selecting the type of stent, as DES placement would require longer dual-antiplatelet therapy [16].In our case, further characterization of the ostial lesion by using prestenting IVUS was not possible because the IVUS catheter could not be negotiated through the critical narrowing of the lesion. Furthermore, the length of the procedure and the patient’s disquiet did not allow us to extend the procedure for poststenting IVUS. Although IVUS could not be done in our case, it should be considered in future cases to better understand possible underlying mechanism and optimize stenting.Although coronary ostial stenosis typically occurs within the first 6 months after SAVR, we describe its identification in association with NSTEMI 22 months after the surgery. Therefore, coronary ostial stenosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain or arrhythmia in patients presenting with a history of SAVR, even if the procedure was performed more than 1 year prior to presentation. Also, we should continue to have a higher index of suspicion in these patients for ACS even after sufficient time has passed.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Incidental Finding of the Anomalous Origin of Left Main Coronary Artery from Pulmonary Artery in an Adult Presenting with Arrhythmia-Induced Myocardial Ischemia

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital coronary anomaly with high mortality. It is associated with cardiovascular complications and is usually diagnosed soon after birth. Those who survive into adulthood can present with signs of myocardial infarction, heart failure, mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, or sudden cardiac death. We present a 53-year-old female presenting with atrial fibrillation and found to have an incidental diagnosis of ALCAPA who refused surgical correction. We also review the epidemiology, diagnosis, age-based clinical presentations, and treatment options for ALCAPA.Coronary artery anomalies may be found in up to 1% of the general population [1]. Mostly, these anomalies are benign and can be found incidentally [2]. But certain coronary artery anomalies are associated with life-threatening cardiac complications including heart failure, ischemia, arrhythmias, and death. Anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), also known as Bland–White–Garland syndrome, is a rare congenital abnormality with high mortality. It causes a left to right shunt, thereby causing “coronary steal” and impaired myocardial perfusion. It is most commonly detected within the first one or two months of life. ALCAPA syndrome is one of the commonest causes of myocardial ischemia and infarction in children. If left untreated, up to 90% of patients with ALCAPA syndrome die within the first year of life [3]. Those who survive into adulthood can present with signs of myocardial infarction, heart failure, mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, or sudden cardiac death. In recent years, reports of adult patients with benign clinical presentation have been described. We present one such adult with undiagnosed ALCAPA syndrome presenting with atrial fibrillation accompanied by significant elevations in cardiac enzymes.A 53-year-old healthy female with known hypothyroidism being treated with thyroid hormone replacement presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset chest pain and palpitations. Her electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 140 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed a continuous murmur at the left sternal border. She spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm with complete resolution of her chest pain. Her troponin I level was 17 ng/ml. EKG-gated multidetector cardiac computed tomographic angiography revealed the presence of a large anomalous left main coronary arising from the main pulmonary artery (Figure 1). The left anterior descending artery, diagonal branch, and left circumflex arteries arising from the left main were ectatic vessels with extensive collateralization with a large ectatic right coronary artery arising from the right aortic coronary sinus (Figure 2). She remained asymptomatic, and her troponins normalized. Her atrial fibrillation was attributed to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism resulting from an excess in recommended doses for thyroid replacement therapy. The thyroid stimulating hormone level was noted to be low and reported at 0.05 mU/L.A 2D echocardiogram revealed normal biventricular size and function with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Ventricular wall thickness was calculated to be normal in addition to normal left ventricular diastolic function and filling pressures. There were no advanced valvular abnormalities, and a mild degree of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation was present. There was evidence of markedly increased color Doppler signaling within the interventricular septum suggestive of high blood flow through septal collaterals (Figures 3 and 4). Coronary angiography showed evidence of retrograde blood flow in the left coronary system into the pulmonary trunk through collateral supply from the systemic side, secondary to relatively low right-sided pressures, and vascular resistance causing coronary steal (Video 1). Our patient was offered surgery for reimplantation of her left main into the aorta but she refused. Considering that her presentation of myocardial damage was secondary to a lack of oxygenated blood during increased demand at the time of tachycardia, a rhythm control strategy for the atrial fibrillation was adopted and the patient was discharged from the hospital on a reduced dose of thyroid replacement therapy with close follow-up.Krause first discovered anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in the 1860s, which was later confirmed by Brooks in 1885 during a study on anatomical variations [4, 5]. However, the earliest clinical description was not until 1933 when Bland, White, and Garland observed a 3-month-infant with paroxysmal attacks of acute discomfort precipitated by exertion and associated with profound vasomotor collapse [6]. The EKG findings of this infant mimicked that of myocardial infarction in an adult. An autopsy showed anomalous origin of the left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery similar to that previously described by Krause and Brooks. Hence, it is also known as Bland–White–Garland syndrome.Based on a Canadian heart registry, the incidence of ALCAPA is believed to be 1 per 300,000 live births [7]. ALCAPA occurs due to abnormal division of the conotruncus into the aorta and pulmonary artery or the persistence of the pulmonary buds together with involution of the aortic buds that form the coronary arteries during embryogenesis [8]. During the intrauterine period, the left coronary system has antegrade blood flow from the pulmonary artery, as pulmonary pressure is higher. As pulmonary resistance and oxygen content drops in the pulmonary arterial system during the neonate phase, the myocardium is perfused with blood with low oxygen content. Eventually, collaterals develop from the right coronary artery to supply the branches of the left coronary system, and the pressure in the left coronary system rises. This results in reversal of flow from the left coronary system to low pressure pulmonary system. The phenomenon is often regarded as “coronary steal.” Depending on the extent of collaterals, the clinical spectrum can be divided in four types:(1)Infantile type: in a review of postmortem cases, Kaunitz pointed out that closure of ductus arteriosus around 2 months of age was coincidental with development of symptoms [9]. Indeed, closure of ductus arteriosus decreases the oxygenated blood to the left coronary artery via the pulmonary artery. This leads to left ventricular ischemia. About 90% of cases present between 2 and 4 months, with signs of poor growth, tachypnea, profuse sweating, and angina-like episodes (usually occurring after nursing as the sudden onset of a distressed state with pallor). About 90% of those infants who are symptomatic and remain untreated die within first two years of life.(2)Asymptomatic adult type: most adults with ALCAPA who survive infancy are found to have extensive collateralization and a dilated RCA. It is hypothesized that in infancy, the RCA supplies not only the posterior but also the lateral wall. These patients have continuous murmur due to collateral blood flow, or mild mitral regurgitation or incidental cardiomegaly on chest X-ray. While initial case reports showed a high percentage of patients present with sudden cardiac death, with recent advent of EKG-gated CT scans, cardiac MRIs, and easy accessibility of echo, higher numbers of asymptomatic and older individuals are being diagnosed in the last few years.(3)Symptomatic adult type: these adults present with signs of angina due to increased flow from collaterals to the low-pressure pulmonary artery or coronary steal, which occurs during stress. These patients may also have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation occurs due to left ventricular dilatation or papillary muscle dysfunction [10].(4)Sudden cardiac death: about 85% of adult cases have no previous cardiac symptoms. Histologic studies have shown substantial amount of viable but depressed contractile material and variable degree of fibrosis in myocardial tissue, which is believed to be a precursor to fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias [11].A comprehensive review of ECGs by Yau et al. showed Q waves in anterior leads in 50% of patients and left ventricular hypertrophy in up to 28% of all cases [12]. Using Doppler echocardiography, good visualization of the dilated RCA with retrograde flow into the left coronary artery and pulmonary artery along with septal collateralization is diagnostic in 90% of cases. Coronary angiography and cardiac CT scanning can be diagnostic when typical features of echocardiogram are not seen. Cardiac MRI has an advantage of finding scar tissue, areas of ischemia, and myocardial viability [13].Surgery is the only definitive treatment. While ligation of the LCA at its origin was initially practiced, it was met with high incidence of late sudden cardiac deaths. In modern period, we found an adult case with primary use of the transcatheter closure device to occlude the LCA [14]. Establishing dual coronary supply using saphenous venous graft was found to be superior to ligation of LCA alone [15]. With advent of technology, direct reimplantation of the left coronary artery to the aorta has become very popular with good long-term results. Takeuchi procedure, introduced in 1979, involved the creation of an aortopulmonary window and intrapulmonary tunnel extending from the anomalous ostium to the window. This procedure is now unpopular due to late complications such obstruction of the baffle created between the anomalous coronary artery and supravalvular pulmonary stenosis in up to 33% of cases [16]. Normalization of cardiac function at rest is seen in all operative survivors in the first year itself, albeit exercise testing still may reveal subtle functional disability [17].Majority of evidence suggests that mild to moderate MR corrects due to reverse LV modeling after the left coronary artery repair. Severe MR caused by irreversible myocardial necrotic damage or papillary muscle infarction needs concomitant repair to prevent long-term MR after alone ALCAPA repair [18]. Implantation of an ICD is usually reserved for patients who present with fatal ventricular arrhythmias. In a small cohort, no recurrence of ventricular arrhythmia was seen up to 10 years after ICD implantation [19].ALCAPA is a rare but life-threatening disease. There should a strong clinical suspicion in young patients who present with unexplained cardiomegaly on imaging, continuous murmur on exam, or EKG findings of infarction without a history of ischemia. Due to lack of long-term data on medical therapy, surgical correction is the mainstay of therapy.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Video 1: coronary angiography shows an ectatic right coronary artery supplying the left coronary artery system through collaterals with retrograde flow into the pulmonary artery.

Successful Treatment of an Infant with Left Ventricular Noncompaction Presenting with Fatal Ventricular Arrhythmia Treated with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy and an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We herein report the successful treatment of a 4-year-old girl with left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) who presented with incessant ventricular fibrillation at 5 months of age. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted, and dual chamber (DDD) pacing was initiated at 7 months of age. At her 10-month follow-up, her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) had decreased from 45% to 20% with mechanical dyssynchrony. After upgrading to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), the LVEF improved to 50%. The usefulness of CRT in pediatric LVNC has not been fully elucidated. However, our case suggests that CRT therapy may be an effective option for LVNC-induced cardiac dysfunction.Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare congenital cardiomyopathy with a clinical presentation that ranges from no symptoms to sudden cardiac death due to fatal arrhythmia or heart failure. The onset of fatal ventricular arrhythmia under 1 year of age is a risk factor for cardiac death and an indication for heart transplantation [1]. LVNC is characterized by prominent left ventricular (LV) trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses, which are assumed to be the result of failure or abnormality of the myocardial compaction process during the prenatal period [2]. However, Jensen et al. recently hypothesized that hypertrabeculation may not be a failure of myocardial compaction, but rather an aberration of mammalian cardiogenesis [3]. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for heart failure in pediatric congenital heart disease is an emerging option [4, 5]; however, few reports on CRT in pediatric LVNC patients are available [6].A 6-month-old girl was transferred to our university hospital presenting with incessant ventricular fibrillation (VF) after rewarming therapy for cerebral hypothermia. There was no family history of cardiovascular or neurologic disease. Her development until the event was normal, and at 5 months after birth, she went into cardiopulmonary arrest. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation by emergency medical services, VF was detected using an automated external defibrillator. Sinus rhythm was restored by defibrillation shock. Cerebral hypothermia treatment for 4 days was initiated at a tertiary emergency city hospital. After rewarming, VF occurred again and incessantly repeated without stimulation. She was moved to our university hospital, and her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and VF (Figure 1(a)). After administration of various antiarrhythmic drugs and sedatives, the fatal arrhythmia finally stopped (Figure 1(b)). Laboratory blood tests did not indicate myocarditis or metabolic disease. A chest X-ray revealed no cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) of 52% (Figure 1(c)). Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed global LV hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. B-mode analysis revealed a two-layer structure with a compacted thin epicardial band and a thick, noncompacted endocardial layer with prominent trabeculae and deep intertrabecular recesses at the LV apical and lateral walls. In the end-systolic phase, the ratio of noncompacted to compacted layers was 2.8. Color Doppler imaging revealed blood filling the recesses from the ventricular cavity (Figures 1(d) and 1(e)).For secondary prevention, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) (Protecta™ XT DR; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was implanted in the patient’s left upper abdominal quadrant, and dual chamber (DDD) pacing was started due to 2 : 1 atrioventricular (AV) block (Figure 1(f)), which might have been induced by administration of amiodarone and beta-blocker (at 7 months of age; height 68 cm, weight 5.6 kg) (Figure 2(a)). The shock lead was run outside of the epicardium and fixed at the level of the superior vena cava. At discharge, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 45% and the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was 96 pg/ml. At her 10-month follow-up, the LVEF decreased to 20% and the patient’s mitral regurgitation had deteriorated severely. Moreover, mechanical dyssynchrony was observed on strain echocardiography (Figure 2(e)), and the patient’s BNP levels increased to 1,300 pg/ml. After ICD implantation, appropriate discharge of the ICD occurred only once when she had developed acute gastroenteritis with ventricular tachycardia. ICD right ventricular (RV) pacing was upgraded to biventricular pacing with a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRTD) (Viva™ XT; Medtronic, NJ, USA) (height 72 cm, weight 8.5 kg). After this upgrade, her LV function gradually improved, with an LVEF of 50% without mechanical dyssynchrony and mild mitral regurgitation (Figure 2(f)). The BNP level decreased to 26 pg/ml, and the CTR was 53% (Figure 2(b)). Over a 3-year follow-up period, the patient’s course was uneventful and she was maintained on bisoprolol (0.3 mg/kg), enalapril (0.25 mg/kg), aspirin, and diuretics. The extent and location of abnormal LV trabeculation did not change during this period. Her developmental delays improved, with exercise, social, and vocal capacities being at the 2-, 3-, and 3-year-old levels, respectively.Whole exome sequencing revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 7 of the DTNA gene (C601T). While the patient’s mother also had the same mutation in the DTNA gene, echocardiogram revealed that the mother’s heart was morphologically and functionally normal. The patient’s father did not have a mutation of the DTNA gene. The DTNA gene of the patient’s older sister was not investigated because of her normal echocardiogram with no medical history.We herein report the successful treatment of a 4-year-old girl who presented with incessant VF and LVNC at 5 months of age. After RV pacing, her cardiac function deteriorated and LVEF decreased; however, CRT corrected her mechanical dyssynchrony, which subsequently improved cardiac function.LVNC was first described pathologically by Grant in 1926 [7] and has been defined as a genetic cardiomyopathy by the American Heart Association since 2006 [8]. It is a rare disorder that is believed to develop due to cessation of the refinement of ventricular muscles between the 5th and 8th week of gestational age [2]. However, Jansen et al. recently hypothesized that hypertrabeculation is not a failure of myocardial compaction, but rather an aberration of mammalian cardiogenesis [3]. They proposed that the evolutionary and developmental models of normal and hypertrabeculated hearts and trabeculations in LVNC are not similar to the trabeculations of embryos or ectotherms, viewed in the light of histological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.The clinical presentation of LVNC ranges from no symptoms to sudden cardiac death due to fatal arrhythmia or heart failure. Brescia et al. investigated the long-term prognosis of 242 pediatric LVNC patients and reported that the mortality rate was 12.8%, the sudden cardiac death rate was 6.2%, and 5.4% of patients received a heart transplant [1]. The risk of death was strongly associated with cardiac dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias for <1 year. LVNC is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, and gene mutations, which encode sarcomeric, cytoskeletal, and nuclear membrane proteins, are identified in only half of all reported cases [2]. In 2001, Ichida et al. reported a family with LVNC and a DTNA missense mutation in exon 4 (C362T) [9]. Whole exome sequencing in our patient revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 7 of the DTNA gene (C601T). Interestingly, our patient’s mother also had the same mutation; however, her heart was morphologically normal. These differences may be due to incomplete penetrance of the DTNA gene in our case and/or the dominant negative effects of the missense mutation in exon 4. To the best of our knowledge, a DTNA gene mutation associated with LVNC was observed in only one family, and the function of the DTNA gene in LVNC has not been fully elucidated. No specific treatment has been established for LVNC, and ICD implantation is performed as a preventive measure for lethal ventricular arrhythmia. In a previous study, Kobza et al. reported that ICD implantation was effective as a primary and secondary preventive measure for sudden cardiac death in LVNC patients (30 patients; mean age 48 ± 14 years) [10]. Moreover, ICD with cardiac resynchronization improved LVEF from 22 ± 5% before implantation to 37 ± 15% after implantation, with a mean follow-up of 18 ± 11 months (six patients; mean age 58 ± 17 years). These studies were conducted in adult populations. However, implantation of ICD in pediatric patients is associated with several limitations. Indeed, the size of the devices and lead implantation result in placement difficulties of these therapeutic devices in pediatric patients. In our case, it seems that RV (DDD) pacing using an ICD caused LV function deterioration due to mechanical dyssynchrony. Cardiac function dramatically improved after introducing biventricular pacing using CRTD. It is known that in a certain proportion of pediatric patients with RV pacing, LV failure may develop. Indeed, Roman et al. demonstrated that epicardial RV free wall pacing is a risk factor for pacing-induced heart failure [11]. Moreover, due to their small heart size, selecting pacing lead positions is very difficult in infants. RV pacing-induced LV dysfunction responds well to biventricular pacing therapy [4]. Currently, there are no prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating pediatric CRT, and device therapy has become an emerging option for treating heart failure in pediatric heart disease [5]. Most reports in the medical literature concerning the use of CRT in pediatric patients are case reports that focus on the efficacy of CRT in treating severe heart failure. Only two large studies on the use of CRT in pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) have been published. Dubin et al. [12] reported their findings in 16 patients, while Cecchin et al. [13] included 10 patients with DCM in their study. No mortality was reported in these studies; however, additional reports of similar cases are needed to determine standard guidelines concerning the use of CRT in pediatric patients. The usefulness of CRT in pediatric LVNC remains to be fully elucidated. Our case suggests that CRT therapy could be an effective option for LVNC-induced cardiac dysfunction.The present case provides important insights into the midterm effects of biventricular pacing and CRTD implantation for infantile LVNC. It is necessary to consider pediatric body size with respect to device and lead implantation. CRTD treatment is useful for the management of infantile LVNC with mechanical dyssynchrony and may improve prognosis.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Mesenteric Ischemia and Myocardial Infarction Associated with Atrial Fibrillation
Cardiovascular Center, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, 95 Yong’an Road, Xicheng District, Beijing, ChinaCorrespondence should be addressed to Yongquan Wu; moc.361@76nauqgnoyuwReceived 21 November 2017; Accepted 25 March 2018; Published 1 April 2018Academic Editor: Markus FerrariCopyright © 2018 Liting Cheng and Yongquan Wu. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Atrial fibrillation is a common disease correlated with embolism incidents. However, there is lack of report on atrial fibrillation causing myocardial infarction and mesenteric ischemia at the same time. Our patient is a 69-year-old woman who had undergone thoracic surgery a month before presented to our hospital with newly discovered atrial fibrillation, abdominal pain, and ST-elevated myocardial infarction. This is a rare case that atrial fibrillation took place one month after surgery and caused embolism incidents in both coronary artery and mesenteric artery.Recently, the relationship between stroke and atrial fibrillation has been well studied by both cardiologists and neurologists. However, there is lack of report on atrial fibrillation causing myocardial infarction and mesenteric ischemia at the same time. Here, we present a case in which atrial fibrillation was related to thoracic surgery and finally caused myocardial infarction and mesenteric ischemia simultaneously.A 69-year-old woman who had undergone surgery for left lung adenocarcinoma 1 month ago presented to the hospital with 8 hours of abdominal pain and 6 hours of palpitation. The physical examination revealed that her pulse was 68 beats per minute and the respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute; her heart rate was 107 beats per minute with an irregular first heart sound three thoracoscopic surgical wounds could be found in the left chest wall bowel sounds were normal and there was no diffuse abdominal tenderness. The laboratory tests were as follows: granulocyte count, 82.8 (1.8–6.3) × 109 per liter; fibrin degradation products level, 24 (0–5) milligram per liter; D-dimer level, 7.9 (0–1.5) milligram per liter; creatine kinase-MB, 6.9 (0–6.6) picogram per millimeter; troponin I, 3.153 (0–6.6) nanogram per millimeter; troponin T, 0.32 (0.010–0.017) nanogram per millimeter. Her previous Holter result showed no sign of atrial fibrillation, while the 12-lead electrocardiogram at the emergency department showed atrial fibrillation with ST-segment elevations (1 to 2 mm) in II, III, aVF, and V5–V6 (Figure 1).The patient had a history of prolonged ongoing (greater than 20 minutes) rest pain that is less than 12 hours in duration; cardiac troponin T, troponin I, and creatine kinase-MB were elevated; the ECG indicated ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction. Urgent coronary angiography was preformed which identified no crucial stenosis in the left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery, and posterior descending artery. However, a thrombotic occlusion could be found in the posterior lateral descending artery (Figure 2). No intervention was given to the patient.A treatment combined aspirin, clopidogrel, low-molecular-weight heparin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, metoprolol, and pantoprazole was prescribed to our patient. However, she was stopped giving aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin because the occult blood test turned positive and the platelet account started to decrease. The abdominal pain diminished after the angiogram; however, among the next 5 days, the abdominal discomfort occurred again and again without any causes and aggravated by eating. Abdominal computed tomography with contrast material showed occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (Figure 3).Considering that the mesenteric ischemia was caused by the embolism, rivaroxaban and clopidogrel were given to the patient. The vital of this patient is well during the follow-up.Atrial fibrillation, known as the most common arrhythmia, is highly related with embolism incidents. It has been reported that more than 3% of patients with ischaemic stroke in the South Asia and almost 20% in Western Europe, North America, and Australia are associated with atrial fibrillation [1]. Furthermore, the embolization of the peripheral extremities and arteries (splenic artery, renal artery, and mesenteric artery) are also correlated with atrial fibrillation [2]. However, both myocardial infarction and mesenteric ischemia attributed to atrial fibrillation are lack of report. Our patient presented to the emergency department with both abdominal pain and chest pain. Due to the elevation of cardiac troponin T, troponin I, creatine kinase-MB, and ST-segment in electrocardiogram, an emergency angiogram was performed. The occlusion of the posterior lateral descending artery was found which explains the myocardial infarction. Abdominal computed tomography revealed occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery.The auxiliary examination, angiogram along with abdominal computed tomography, indicated it was a patient with both coronary and superior mesenteric artery embolism.But what did cause atrial fibrillation? The risk factors of atrial fibrillation are variable which include valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, thyroid dysfunction, and so on [3]. On the contrary, the patient had no history of any kind of the diseases mentioned above. The Holter performed right before the thoracic surgery showed no sign of atrial fibrillation. Could the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation correlate with the surgery? Postoperative atrial fibrillation caught the eyes of doctors most recent years. It has been reported that more than 10% of patients who underwent anatomic lung resection had postoperative atrial fibrillation [4]. However, the importance of rhythm assessment after surgery is still short of knowledge. The CHA2DS2-VAS score of our patient was up to 4 (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, age, and sex), in which according to the previous study anticoagulation was needed [5, 6]. Unfortunately, no rhythm assessment was given to the patient, and anticoagulants were not administered which finally led to myocardial infarction and mesenteric ischemia. Therefore, it is significant to give patients with previous thoracic operation rhythm assessment to prevent further embolism incidents.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 81570220).
STEMI in a Young Male after Use of Synephrine-Containing Dietary Supplement
Department of Internal Medicine, Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, NJ, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Dileep Unnikrishnan; moc.liamg@innupeelidrdReceived 24 November 2017; Accepted 18 March 2018; Published 1 April 2018Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2018 Dileep Unnikrishnan et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A twenty-two-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with chest pain was found to have ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and V4–V6. On subsequent EKGs, patient had new ST-segment elevations in anterolateral leads with dynamic changes. Cardiac catheterization showed acute dissection with thrombosis of the distal left main coronary artery leading into the ostial left anterior descending artery. The patient had no cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or family history of early cardiac disease. On further inquiry, the patient was found to be on two separate performance-enhancing supplements which contained synephrine, a sympathomimetic chemical which was later attributed as the cause of his acute coronary syndrome. Synephrine acts on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors causing peripheral and coronary vasoconstriction, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. Increased hemodynamic stress on the coronary arteries can lead to fatal dissections. Ours is an atypical case of synephrine-induced nonatherosclerotic spontaneous coronary artery dissection which helps caution the physicians about the importance of dietary supplement use in the history and possible side effects of such performance-enhancing additives.Several weight-loss and performance-enhancing dietary supplements are available over the counter in the US markets. Adding sympathomimetic chemicals like ephedra-containing compounds are highly effective in performance enhancement with the potential of causing fatal cardiac and respiratory side effects. Ephedra-containing compounds were banned by the FDA. However, this has led to the use of alternative sympathomimetic compounds like synephrine in these dietary supplements [1]. These selective alpha blockers can potentially be dangerous due to their effects like elevated systemic blood pressure, coronary vasospasm, and arterial dissections. Nonatherosclerotic spontaneous coronary artery dissection (NA-SCAD) is a rare cause of nontraumatic coronary dissection in young adults due to weakening of the arterial wall from hemodynamic stress. Most commonly associated factors include fibromuscular dysplasia, postpartum status, connective tissue disorders, and hormonal therapy [2]. Here, we report a case of a massive STEMI in a young African American male secondary to the use of synephrine-containing dietary supplement. On review of literature, we were able to find only one other similar case of young STEMI attributed to sympathomimetic dietary supplement administration [3].A 22-year-old African American male presented to the ER with acute onset of “pressure-like” substernal, nonradiating chest pain. His symptoms started while playing basketball. The pain was associated with shortness of breath and nausea. He had no significant past medical history or family history of coronary artery disease or sudden deaths. He denied excessive caffeine use, smoking, or alcohol intake. There was no reported use of any illicit drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines and was physically very active. Vital signs on admission included blood pressure of 138/89 mmHg, heart rate of 94/min, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min. His BMI was 28. Physical examination was unremarkable with no chest tenderness on palpation and no jugular venous distention. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs or additional sounds. The electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in leads II, III, aVF, and V4–V6 (Figure 1). On subsequent EKGs, the patient had new ST-segment elevations in anterolateral leads with dynamic changes. Laboratory studies were pertinent for a troponin-I level of 0.83 ng/ml. The patient was given aspirin and ticagrelor loading doses, metoprolol succinate 25 mg, intravenous morphine, intravenous heparin drip, and sublingual nitroglycerin which did not relieve his chest pain.The patient was taken for emergent cardiac angiography within 60 minutes of presentation and revealed acute dissection with thrombosis of the distal left main coronary artery (LCA) leading into the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) (Figures 2 and 3). An EBU 3.5 guide catheter was advanced over the wire with repeat injection of the left main performed revealing persistence of acute occlusion. Repeat angiography after balloon inflation revealed significant improvement in flow from TIMI 2 to TIMI 4. An extending thrombus was noted in the distal LAD which was suctioned out. Following this, a bare metal stent was inserted in the distal LCA ostial and the proximal LAD (Figures 4 and 5).After catheterization, the patient was pain-free and hemodynamically stable. He was on epitifibatide infusion for a total of 18 hours. Other medications including carvedilol, lisinopril, aspirin, ticagrelor, and atorvastatin were initiated. The patient’s peak troponin went up to 48.56 ng/ml in less than 24 hrs of initial laboratory studies and subsequently was trending down. Additional laboratory studies including hemoglobin A1c and lipid profile were normal. He was also worked up for thrombotic conditions which might lead to arterial thrombi such as homocystinemia and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome both of which were negative. Transthoracic echocardiography performed revealed preserved left ventricular systolic function normal with ejection fraction estimated to be 0.50 to 0.54%. There was no patent foramen ovale that might have led to paradoxical embolus. A urine and serum toxicology screen was also done on the patient who came back as negative for cocaine or methamphetamine.After the procedure, the patient was further questioned to elicit any history that might shine light to the etiology of his STEMI. He admitted to the use of two different weight-loss products (Performix™ stim-free; Performix SST) for the past 1 year, taking one capsule up to three times a day as indicated on the product label. However, he took Performix SST for the first time on the afternoon of presentation, drinking 3 scoops mixed with water, approximately 2 hours before started playing basketball. On reviewing, the contents of the supplement, it was noted to contain synephrine, an epinephrine analogue. Other contents of the mixture consisted of anhydrous caffeine, sensoril ashwagandha extract, bitter orange extract, n-methyltyramine, hordenine, tyramine, octopamine, huperzine A, yohimbine HCL, mucuna pruriens, and Bioperine. The patient was advised to avoid the use of the supplements. He was discharged home from the hospital with outpatient cardiology follow-up and advice to be maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy for at least one year.This is an interesting case of a young active male with no apparent past medical or familial risk factors who presented with STEMI secondary to dissection with thrombosis of distal left main coronary artery extending to proximal LAD. The patient’s condition could be attributed to his use of synephrine-containing weight-loss and performance-enhancing supplements. Administration of beta-blockers preprocedure might also have led to the unimpeded alpha action of the adrenergics in this case. Synephrine is a naturally occurring alkaloid which has been used in combination with caffeine in several weight-loss and dietary supplements. Pharmacologically synephrine has its action on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors causing effects such as peripheral vasoconstriction, hypertension, and hyperglycemia [4]. Unsupervised use of such supplements could be risky and even fatal. In addition, mixing several stimulants and natural compounds such as caffeine and bitter orange extract with synephrine can lead to increase in the adverse effects profile of each [5]. A definitive causal relation between the dietary supplement intake and coronary dissection cannot be drawn in this case; however, given the paucity of any other likely risk factors, the event is presumably secondary to the hypertension and sympathetic overactivity from synephrine. Dietary supplement and weight reduction drug industries are highly lucrative, and the unscrupulous and potentially dangerous practice of adding sympathomimetic compounds for quick results is rampant [6]. More FDA regulations have to be implemented in this regard for the safety of the users. For any such patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome, the use of beta-blockers should be avoided [7]. Furthermore, it is important for physicians to be cognizant of sympathomimetics in the dietary supplements and elicit such history in atypical cases such as the one presented here in order to avoid diagnostic confusion and inadvertent harm to the patient.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Cor Triatriatum Sinister: An Unusual Cause of Atrial Fibrillation in Adults
1Section of Cardiology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada2Section of Cardiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada3Cardiac Sciences Program, St. Boniface Hospital, Winnipeg, MB, CanadaCorrespondence should be addressed to Malek Kass; ac.bm.hgbs@ssakmReceived 11 December 2017; Accepted 6 March 2018; Published 31 March 2018Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2018 Christopher Hayes et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Cor triatriatum is a rare congenital heart defect that is associated with an increased risk for developing atrial fibrillation. We report a case of a healthy 38-year-old man who presented in decompensated heart failure and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated severe biventricular dysfunction and dilatation in addition to cor triatriatum sinister. He was diuresed with resolution of his symptoms and spontaneously converted back to sinus rhythm. There is limited evidence in the literature surrounding anticoagulation and associated left ventricular dysfunction in the setting of cor triatriatum which posed difficult therapeutic decisions.Cor triatriatum sinister is a rare congenital defect in which the left atrium is divided into two chambers by a membrane. Cor triatriatum comprises approximately 0.4% of congenital heart disease at autopsy [1]. It is found in less than 0.1% of clinically diagnosed cardiomyopathies [2]. It is typically identified in children and is a particularly rare new diagnosis in adults [3]. Atrial fibrillation has been described in 30% of published cases on adults with cor triatriatum [4]. We describe a case of an adult male who had known cor triatriatum (but not being actively followed) who presented in congestive heart failure in the setting of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation and dilated cardiomyopathy.A previously healthy 38-year-old man, who had emigrated from Honduras 5 years ago, presented with a several weeks history of progressive abdominal pain and dyspnea. Physical examination revealed respiratory distress, an irregularly irregular tachycardia at 140 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 126/72 mmHg. The cardiac exam was remarkable for a displaced and diffuse apical beat, and a 2/6 mitral regurgitation murmur heard at the apex. His ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response. There was no electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular overload. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated a markedly dilated left atrium in the four-chamber view (51 mm) divided into 2 chambers by a membrane (Figure 1). Continuous wave Doppler showed flow across the membrane with a peak diastolic gradient of 6 mmHg, peak systolic gradient of 2 mmHg, and a mean of 4 mmHg (Figure 2). The left ventricle (LV) was dilated in the parasternal long-axis view (65 mm) with an ejection fraction of 20–30%. There was moderate-to-severe functional mitral regurgitation. The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was 70 mmHg. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a membrane within the left atrium (LA) with a 7 mm gap in its midportion and measured a peak gradient of 15 mmHg. The interatrial septum was intact. Of note, the patient had a previous TTE 5 years ago when first immigrating to Canada, which identified a dilated left atrium and the cor triatriatum defect which had a peak gradient of 9 mmHg, which was not that much different than the more current study. The LV was normal in size and systolic function at that time. The patient and his primary care provider were unaware of this prior established diagnosis.The patient was admitted and diuresed. He spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm and remained free of AF at discharge. Given the coexistence of AF and cor triatriatum sinister, the decision was made to initiate anticoagulation with heparin with subsequent conversion to warfarin. The workup of alternative causes of his dilated cardiomyopathy (including serology for Chagas and autoimmune disease) proved to be negative. In addition, there was no history of significant alcohol intake. At 3 months follow-up, he remained in sinus rhythm and had returned to functional class 1 despite lack of improvement in LV systolic function on focused cardiac ultrasound evaluation.Cor triatriatum sinister is a rare congenital malformation involving an abnormal membrane dividing the left atrium into two chambers. It is thought to arise from failure to resorb components of the common pulmonary vein during embryogenesis [4]. The most common comorbid cardiac conditions in adults are atrial septal defects and mitral regurgitation [3]. Patients typically present with pulmonary edema in infancy unless a sizeable opening in the membrane allows for sufficient drainage of the affected pulmonary veins [3]. This opening may become obstructed later in life secondary to fibrosis and calcification and can lead to the development of symptoms [4]. Left atrial dilatation ensues from elevated filling pressures, and this substrate can give rise to the development of AF in a manner analogous to mitral stenosis [5].Given the rarity of the diagnosis, formal guidelines do not exist on the optimal timing of surgical correction. Surgery has typically been offered in symptomatic adults [5]. In the largest surgical case series published, the mean age at the time of surgery was 27 years and the mean gradient across the membrane in those surgically repaired was 17.2 mmHg [5]. Outcomes after surgical repair have typically been excellent [5].This case posed several unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy in this gentleman was not entirely clear. The initial suspicion was that the cardiomyopathy was secondary to uncontrolled tachycardia. This was challenged by the persistently depressed ejection fraction at 3 months follow-up despite apparent maintenance of sinus rhythm, and therapeutic doses of a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor. The workup for alternative etiologies had been negative, and no additional cardiac congenital abnormalities were discovered. Cor triatriatum has rarely been described in association with left ventricular failure, but in the setting of an additional insult such as pregnancy [6]. There is no reported association between cor triatriatum and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Apart from the development of atrial tachyarrhythmias and associated cardiomyopathy, there does not appear to be a known link between cor triatriatum and the development of dilated cardiomyopathy.Cardioembolic stroke has been reported to occur with cor triatriatum with and without concurrent atrial fibrillation [7], and it has been proposed that clot formation in the left atrium shares a similar pathophysiology to mitral stenosis [8]. There are no data with regard to prophylactic anticoagulation in the absence of atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation in this case was clearly indicated, given atrial fibrillation with the additional risk factor of congestive heart failure. Given the proposed left atrial pathophysiologic similarities with mitral stenosis, the decision was made to treat with a vitamin K antagonist.Cor triatriatum is a rare but increasingly recognized congenital abnormality that can become symptomatic later in life. It is associated with the development of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, and rarely with the development of left ventricular dysfunction. As access to imaging modalities and the quality thereof improve, more data will be needed to guide treatment decisions around thromboembolic prophylaxis and follow-up to prevent complications.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Should de Winter T-Wave Electrocardiography Pattern Be Treated as ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Equivalent with Consequent Reperfusion? A Dilemmatic Experience in Rural Area of Indonesia

Although de Winter T-wave electrocardiography pattern is rare, it signifies proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion and is often unrecognized by physicians. The aim of this case report was to highlight the dilemma in the management of a patient with de Winter T-wave pattern in the hospital without interventional cardiology facility. Case Presentation. A 65-year-old male presented with typical chest pain since 2 hours before admission, and ECG showed sinus rhythm of 57 bpm and >1 mm upsloping ST depression with symmetric tall T in lead V2-3 characteristic of de Winter T-wave ECG pattern. He was given dual antiplatelet therapy, nitrate, statin, and anticoagulant. He refused referral to interventional cardiology available hospital. 3 hours after admission, the electrocardiography transformed into Q-waves consistent with final stages of acute STEMI and ST-segment elevation that barely meets the threshold in the guideline, and thrombolytic was administered and successful. There is a suggestion that de Winter T-wave electrocardiography should be treated as ST-segment myocardial infarction equivalent and should undergo coronary angiography; however, not every hospital has the luxury of interventional cardiology facility. The other modality for reperfusion is thrombolysis; however, without a clear guideline and scarcity of study, we prefer to resort to conservative treatment. “Fortunately,” transformation into ST-segment elevation helps us to determine the course of action which is reperfusion using thrombolytic. Conclusions. de Winter T-wave ECG pattern is not mentioned in any guidelines regarding acute coronary syndromes, and there are no clear recommendations. Physicians in rural area without interventional cardiology facility face a dilemma with the lack of evidence-based guideline. Fibrinolytic may be appropriate in those without contraindications with strong chest pain consistent with acute coronary occlusion, less than 3 hours of symptoms, and convincing de Winter T-wave ECG pattern for a rural non-PCI hospital far away from PCI capable hospital.In 2008, de Winter et al. reported an electrocardiography (ECG) pattern that is found in about 2% of patients with proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion (acute anterior myocardial infarction) and is often unrecognized by physicians [1, 2]. Although de Winter T-wave ECG pattern was suggested to be managed as STEMI equivalent [3], it was not mentioned in recent guidelines by the European Heart Society (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) [4, 5]. Hence, a question arises regarding whether or not this pattern be treated with fibrinolytic in an area where cardiac catheter laboratory (cath lab) is not readily available. The aim of this case report was to highlight the dilemma in the management of a patient with de Winter T-wave pattern in hospital without interventional cardiology facility (non-PCI hospital).A 65-year-old male presented to the emergency department with typical chest pain at rest since 2 hours before admission after eating. The patient denied shortness of breath and previous episode of chest pain before admission. He had a past medical history of poorly controlled hypertension and was taking captopril. History of diabetes, smoking, and previous stroke or myocardial infarction was denied. On physical examination, blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg, heart rate was 57x/minute, and respiratory rate was 20x/minute, and the cardiopulmonary examination was within normal limits. ECG showed sinus rhythm of 57 bpm and >1 mm upsloping ST depression with symmetric tall T in lead V2-3 characteristic of de Winter T-wave ECG pattern (Figure 1). Routine blood examination, AST/ALT, BUN, and serum creatinine were within normal limits. Sodium was 137 mmol/L, and potassium was 3.4 mmol/L denoting that tall T was not due to hyperkalemia. Troponin at the 2nd hour after onset was negative. The patient was diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome with suspected de Winter T-wave ECG pattern. Aspirin 160 mg, clopidogrel 300 mg, sublingual isosorbide dinitrate, simvastatin 20 mg (atorvastatin was not available), and enoxaparin 0.4 mg subcutaneous were administered. The patient refused referral to the interventional cardiology capable hospital due to distance and socioeconomic causes. Repeat ECG was done 3 hours later showing Q-waves developing in V2–4, consistent with the final stages of acute STEMI accompanied with ST-segment elevation in lead V2–4 which barely meets the 2 mm threshold for those precordial leads as per the guidelines (Figure 2). Elevated troponin at the 5th hour confirmed the presence of myocardial infarction. The patient still experienced sustained and severe chest pain although not as intense as initial presentation. Streptokinase (1.5 million units) was administered, and chest pain subsided with a resolution of ST-segment elevation (Figure 3). The patient was discharged on the 5th day after admission.The de Winter T-wave ECG pattern may signify proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion and was suggested as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) equivalent [1–3]. The de Winter T-wave ECG pattern was also shown to have positive predictive values of 95.2% (95% confidence interval: 76.2–99.9%), 100% (69.2–100.0%), and 100% (51.7–100%) for acute coronary occlusions in the three diagnostic studies [6]. Verouden et al. also reported that approximately 50% of those with de Winter T-wave ECG pattern had a wraparound LAD which is associated with larger area of ischemia [2]. However, despite these findings, de Winter T-wave ECG pattern is yet to be included in ESC guidelines for management of acute coronary syndromes in both persistent (2017) or without persistent ST-elevation (2015) and ACC/AHA guidelines regarding STEMI (2013) and NSTEMI (2014) [4, 5].Ideally, the presence of de Winter T-wave ECG should be treated as urgent as STEMI with catheter lab activation for coronary angiography and possible stenting. This was not possible in our case due to a limited facility in the region [3]. Thrombolysis was initially avoided because de Winter T-wave ECG is currently not an indication for fibrinolysis even in latest guidelines, and there was no clear-cut evidence of acute coronary occlusion. The lack of the evidence-based guidelines for the aforementioned condition compelled us to choose dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulant for the initial mainstay of therapy. Evolution from suspected de Winter T-wave pattern to the final stage of acute STEMI was observed three hours after admission. This helped us in ushering the direction of management, as the guideline for STEMI is straightforward in terms of reperfusion. Thrombolysis was initiated, and repeat ECG showed resolution of chest pain and elevated ST-Segment which proves the acute coronary occlusion (anterior myocardial infarction).Whether de Winter T-wave ECG pattern can evolve into STEMI is debatable, and there are arguments that de Winter T-wave pattern is a part of STEMI evolution which was impeded with aggressive antithrombotic/antiplatelet therapy [7]. Another opinion states that ECG evolution into STEMI was actually indicative of hyperacute T-wave instead of de Winter T-wave ECG pattern, in which the latter usually progresses directly to sign of transmural infarction on ECG [3, 8]. A more diplomatic view was the categorization of de Winter T-wave ECG pattern into those 2 debated groups, respectively [9]. The presence of Q-waves in our patient with ST-segment elevation which barely meets 2 mm suggests transformation into final stages of acute STEMI; hence, our patient showed both evolution into STEMI and signs of transmural infarction (Q-wave).Regardless of the debate, the most important issue is to recognize this ECG pattern and prevent the delay in management. Delay leads to a higher total ischemic time which is related to higher mortality in STEMI; however, whether the same applies to de Winter T-wave ECG is unclear [10].The de Winter T-wave ECG pattern is not mentioned in any guidelines regarding acute coronary syndromes, and there are no clear recommendations. Physicians in rural area without interventional cardiology facility face a dilemma with the lack of evidence-based guideline and prefer to resort to a conservative strategy rather than potentially doing harm. Such approach may or may not lead to the best possible outcome but is the only choice in the middle of scarcity. Fibrinolysis may be considered in a young patient (without usual contraindications) who arrives with strong chest pain consistent with acute coronary occlusion, less than 3 hours of symptoms, and with convincing de Winter T-wave ECG pattern (especially if a prior baseline ECG is available for comparison) for a rural non-PCI hospital far away from PCI capable hospital. Discussion with the interventional cardiologist at the PCI hospital whenever possible should also be done in these challenging cases to optimize real-time decision-making.Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Raymond Pranata admitted, evaluated, and treated the patient.

Prenatally Diagnosed Isolated Coronary Arterial Fistula Leading to Severe Complications at Birth

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Prenatal diagnosis of a huge coronary artery fistula between the left coronary artery and the right ventricle was made by Doppler echocardiography at 22 weeks of gestation. Progression of the dilated fistula was monitored throughout pregnancy. The size of the fistula increased enormously up to 11 mm. Death occurred at birth. Monitoring of these fetuses is essential as severe complications can occur during pregnancy or at birth.Fetal echocardiography offers possibilities to identify structural heart defects prenatally. However, visualization of coronary arteries and their blood flow remains difficult because of the small size of the coronary vessels and the movement of the fetus. Previous published data specified an incidence of isolated coronary arterial fistulas (CAFs) in 1 : 50,000 births and a prevalence of ventricular aneurysm in 0.5 : 100,000 births [1]. Mainly single rather than multiple coronary arteries are involved. We report about a prenatal diagnosis of a huge CAF between the left coronary artery and the right ventricle, which was made by Doppler echocardiography at 22 weeks of gestation.A 29-year-old pregnant woman was referred at 22 weeks of gestation because the fetal heart was suspected to be abnormal in a routine ultrasound examination. The fetus was appropriate for age, and no other malformation was found. A high-resolution ultrasound device (Voluson E8 Expert, GE Healthcare, Munich) was used for ultrasound examination of the fetal heart. The fetal heart rate was within normal range. The right ventricle was dilated due to an apical aneurysm, and the contractility of the right ventricle was reduced. The function of the left ventricle seemed to be slightly reduced. Objective measurement of fractional shortening was not possible due to the disturbed right ventricular morphology. A left CAF (diameter 2.9 mm) draining into the aneurysmatic part of the right ventricle was visualized by color Doppler ultrasound. Pulsed Doppler recordings revealed characteristic bidirectional flow in the fistula. Turbulent diastolic reversed flow was detected in the aortic arch resulting from the blood steal phenomenon via CAF into the right ventricular aneurysm (Figure 1). Genetic testing was normal. The poor prognosis and likelihood of intrauterine or perinatal death were discussed with the parents; however, they decided to continue pregnancy. During pregnancy, there was an increase in the size of the fistula, and it became dilated up to 11.5 mm at 37 weeks of gestation (Table 1). The size of the aneurysmatic right ventricle area became larger, and cardiomegaly developed at 35 weeks of gestation. The remaining functional right ventricle became smaller and was difficult to differentiate from the aneurysmatic part of the right ventricle, resulting in a bizzare formation of the right ventricular entity. No tricuspid regurgitation, pericardial effusion, or hydrops developed. The proportion of the aorta and pulmonary artery was normal and remained balanced. Brain-sparing physiology on middle cerebral arterial Doppler was not found. But there was a steal phenomenon, within the aortic arch and head-neck vessels due to the massive filling of the coronary arterial fistula draining blood away from the aortic root. Birth was planned in a center closely related to a major pediatric cardiac center. At 37 3/7 weeks of gestation, induction of labor was performed due to the obvious progression of the disease. Due to less fetal well-being, the child was born by cesarean section at 37 3/7 weeks of gestation in a tertiary obstetric center with standby of pediatricians specialized in pediatric cardiology. The birth weight was 3350 g, length 51 cm, Apgar score 1/3/2, and umbilical artery birth pH 7.29. Despite extremely prolonged resuscitation, the newborn died at 3 hours of life. Postmortem pathology was refused by the parents.CAFs are abnormal connections between a coronary artery and the heart or other blood vessels. Appearance of CAF is uncommon, if anatomy of the fetal heart is otherwise normal.Most of the prenatally diagnosed CAFs have been reported to be asymptomatic. In some cases, small fistulas close spontaneously, whereas large fistulas, as in our presenting case, may increase in size and lead to severe complications [2]. Drainage into a low-pressure system can result in left-to-right shunts leading to heart failure, enlargement of the right chamber, myocardial ischemia from steal effects, and arrhythmia or embolisms [3]. Associated findings such as ventricular aneurysm, as presented in our case, or hydrops can occur. Treatment options are surgical and more recently transcatheter closures of the presenting fistula [4]. Transcatheter closures can result in similar efficacy and safety as surgical treatment. In our case, the right ventricular function seemed to be already decreased at the time of first presentation and became more reduced in its functional parts due to enlargement of the right ventricular fistula. At birth, the newborn was completely unstable and not advisable for any kind of therapeutic procedure. We speculate that death after birth in the presenting case was related to ischemia or low cardiac output due to the steal effects which have been balanced in utero due to different fetal hemodynamic entities. After birth, the usual cardiac output and peripheral resistance increase and decrease of the resistance of the lungs might have led to the augmented blood flow through the fistula into the right ventricle. This might have contributed to a reduced systemic and subendocardial perfusion, leading to subendocardial ischemia and finally low systemic perfusion.In conclusion, CAF is a rare prenatal diagnosis without associated cardiac malformations but can dilate enormously and lead to ventricular aneurysms and heart failure in utero and immediately after birth. There is no broad experience in its treatment before birth at all.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Incidentalomas: A Multimodality Imaging Case of Giant Right Coronary Aneurysm
1Department of Internal Medicine, Gundersen Health System, La Crosse, WI 54601, USA2Department of Cardiology, Gundersen Health System, La Crosse, WI 54601, USA3Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Gundersen Health System, La Crosse, WI 54601, USA4Department of Pathology, Gundersen Health System, La Crosse, WI 54601, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Jamal Janjua; moc.liamg@aujnajlamajReceived 23 November 2017; Revised 15 February 2018; Accepted 3 March 2018; Published 26 March 2018Academic Editor: Ertugrul ErcanCopyright © 2018 Jamal Janjua et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Giant coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) are defined as having a diameter of greater than 2 cm. We report a case of an 82-year-old male with severe aortic stenosis incidentally diagnosed with giant right coronary artery aneurysm (gRCAA) while undergoing evaluation for transcather aortic valve replacement (TAVR). It was causing a mass effect on the right cardiac chambers but was otherwise asymptomatic. Our patient was successfully treated with surgical excision of aneurysm with concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The patient remained stable at discharge and on serial follow-ups for two years. In conclusion, due to the associated complication and increased risk of mortality with giant coronary aneurysms, we recommend surgical approach instead of medical management alone. We also call for evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for management of TAVR incidentalomas.Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been proven to be a safe and effective minimally invasive procedure for aortic stenosis and has been shown to reduce mortality among high-risk patients with aortic valve stenosis irrespective of their candidacy for surgical replacement, typically octogenarians and nonagenarians [1]. As a result of patients’ advanced age, incidentalomas ranging from intracardiac thrombi, extracardiac malignancies and congenital heart diseases are frequently encountered and alter the surgical plan. Coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) is a rare entity typically diagnosed incidentally through imaging studies or at postmortem. Giant coronary artery aneurysms (gCAAs) are even rarer and are defined as having a diameter more than 2 cm. It can be broadly classified into congenital or acquired (e.g., iatrogenic, atherosclerosis, and infectious). We present a multimodality imaging case of a giant right coronary artery aneurysm (gRCAA) found incidentally during workup for aortic valve replacement and outline the unique challenge it presented in this setting.An 82-year-old male with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, permanent atrial fibrillation, ascending aorta enlargement, and obstructive sleep apnea, was referred to our institution. Retrospectively, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed 4 years prior had demonstrated an echolucent mass external to the heart located in the right atrioventricular junction causing mass effect on the right atrium and ventricle (Figure 1); however, it was not investigated further. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the aorta was performed in consideration for TAVR based on his high-risk status as well as patient not wanting to undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for personal reasons. It showed a large encapsulated spherical mass with wall thickening in the right atrioventricular groove measuring 38.6 mm by 47.4 mm, continuous with the right coronary artery in the mid-occluded mid-right coronary artery (RCA) segment, findings consistent with a thrombosed gRCAA (Figures 2(a)–2(c)). Coronary angiography confirmed a totally occluded RCA with a mid-RCA dilation that demonstrated contrast swirling in the aneurysm (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). The left coronary arterial system was without significant disease. The heart team including the cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons agreed that TAVR does not address his gRCAA, which could potentially be fixed by coiling, but this would likely lead to complications from the aneurysm including an RCA infarction, fistula, or other fatal complication intraoperatively. As such, he underwent a surgical aortic valve replacement with a 27 mm Sorin Solo Smart tissue valve, coronary artery bypass grafting was done using a saphenous vein graft to the distal posterior descending artery with end to side to acute marginal anastomosis, the gRCAA was excised and repaired with over sew of proximal and distal coronary artery (Figures 4(a)–4(c)) with a left atrial appendage amputation for his atrial fibrillation. Postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home in a stable condition.Coronary artery aneurysm is defined as dilation of greater than 1.5 times than the reference vessel. It is rare with incidence of 0.02–0.04% in the general population [2]. Increased incidence, however, is reported in patients undergoing diagnostic procedures like angiography, ranging from 1.1 to 4.9% [3]. It usually involves the right coronary artery. In a study by Keyser et al., right-sided gCAA was found in 89% of the cases [4]. One of the most common childhood conditions associated with CAAs is Kawasaki disease, but it can also be found in connective tissue diseases (e.g., Marfan’s and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), infections (e.g., syphilis), inflammation (e.g., polyarthritis nodosa and systemic lupus erythematosus), and iatrogenic causes (like coronary angiography and stenting). The most common acquired cause of CAA is atherosclerosis as suggested in studies by Makris et al. [5] and Hartnell et al. [6] in as early as 1976 and 1985, respectively. The dreaded complications include rupture of CAA [2], thrombosis, embolization and myocardial infarction [7], congestive heart failure, and fistulous connections [8] among others.Management remains controversial. Recommended surgical treatment involves resection of aneurysm with or without coronary bypass graft [2]. Other options include patch repair, coil embolization, and stents [9]. More recently, percutaneous techniques have been used as well [10]. Dai et al. reported a case of gRCAA which was successfully treated percutaneously with multiple overlapping stents [11]. Conservative management includes statins and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation due to the fear of thrombus formation and distal embolization [12] although evidence is still lacking. In our patient, no evidence for vasculitis, infection or connective tissue disease was found. CT angiogram demonstrated significant calcific atherosclerotic coronary artery disease allowing us to positively confirm atherosclerosis as the most likely etiology.Since our patient had aneurysm that remained asymptomatic for the past 4 years, one approach could have been to manage it conservatively. It was supported by the data from coronary artery surgery study (CASS) registry which followed patients throughout the 1980s, and no aneurysmal ruptures were found [13]. However, the authors of this paper propose the individualization of treatment based on patient-related factors and preferences. In our case, the patient required aortic valve replacement and had significant coronary artery disease in addition to the mass effect caused by the gCAA, so it made sense to address it at time of valve repair. An isolated, asymptomatic gCAA without valvular stenosis requiring intervention would have steered us in the direction of medical management alone.Giant coronary aneurysm is a rare entity. However, the probability of encountering it in geriatric cardiology clinical practice is likely to increase with rising rates of percutaneous cardiac interventions like TAVR. With the increasing expansion of TAVR over SAVR to intermediate risk and possibly low-risk patients in the near future, percutaneous options for management of these pathologies will be of paramount importance to justify the eventual cost of TAVR over SAVR for these patients with otherwise limited life expectancies. In addition, knowledge of the various etiologies, associated complications, and treatment options of these incidentalomas are paramount. Optimal management option of GCA is still controversial, but we recommend surgical excision especially if aneurysm is causing a mass effect as seen in our patient. Most incidentalomas found during TAVR evaluation may be benign but can also represent lesions requiring therapeutic interventions that would otherwise not be necessary based on the patient’s life expectancy, thus leading to more expensive medical costs. The specific relevance and implications of the pathologies will vary for the interventional cardiologist as well as the cardiothoracic surgeon. There is therefore a growing need for evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for management of TAVR incidentalomas.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Time of Anderson-Fabry Disease Detection and Cardiovascular Presentation
1Department for Cardiovascular Disease, Osijek University Hospital, J. Huttlera 4, 31000 Osijek, Croatia2Department for Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Osijek, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Cara Hadrijana 10E, 31000 Osijek, CroatiaCorrespondence should be addressed to K. Selthofer-Relatic; moc.liamg@citaler.refohtlesReceived 4 January 2018; Revised 28 January 2018; Accepted 10 February 2018; Published 20 March 2018Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2018 K. Selthofer-Relatic. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Background. Anderson-Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited disease, which manifests in a different manner depending on gender and genotype. Making a working diagnosis of Anderson-Fabry disease is difficult because of several reasons: (a) that it is a multiorgan disease with wide variety of phenotypes, (b) different timelines of presentation, (c) gender differences, and (d) possible coexistence with other comorbidities. Late-onset/cardiac type of presentation with minimal involvement of other organs can additionally make diagnosis difficult. Aim. To describe different cardiac manifestations at different time points in the course of the disease: (1) 72-year-old female (echocardiography detection), heterozygote, significant left and mild right ventricular hypertrophy; (2) 62-year-old male (echocardiography detection), hemizygote, left ventricular hypertrophy, implanted cardiac pacemaker, a performed percutaneous coronary intervention after myocardial infarction, degenerative medium degree aortic valve stenosis; (3) 45-year-old female (asymptomatic/family screening), heterozygote, thickened mitral papillary muscle, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, first degree diastolic dysfunction; and (4) 75-year-old female (symptomatic/family screening), heterozygote, cardiomyopathy with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction after heart surgery (mitral valve annuloplasty and plastic repair of the tricuspid valve). Conclusion. All patients have Anderson-Fabry disease but with different clinical presentations depending on the gender, the type of mutation, and the time of detection. All these features can make the patients’ profiles unique and delay the time of detection.Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is an X-linked disease of lysosomal metabolism resulting in attenuated activity or absence of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (a-Gal A). Impaired glycosphingolipid metabolism leads to systemic lysosomal globotriaosylceramide accumulation with multiorgan systemic involvement and complex clinical presentation: acroparesthesias, angiokeratoma, hypohidrosis, corneal and lenticular opacities, gastrointestinal and endocrine abnormalities, renal impairment, and neural and cardiovascular disease [1, 2].AFD can affect both genders with 2 major phenotypes, the classic and the late-onset subtypes [3]. The classic phenotype has little or no a-Gal A activity and occurs with all typical AFD multiorganic presentations with renal failure development, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and cerebrovascular disease. Late-onset phenotype tends to have mutation-specific cardiac or kidney involvement, with slow progression and unknown underlying mechanisms [3]. Disease presentation of hemizygous males occurs more often as the classical type early in childhood or adolescence with typical symptoms, while heterozygous females can be affected as classical types, although the range of symptoms varies widely [2, 4]. So, it is more appropriate to describe AFD as a disease with a wide spectrum of heterogeneously progressive clinical phenotypes, from the classic severe phenotype in males to the asymptomatic disease course in females, with a variety of clinical presentations in-between. A high percentage of females develop vital organ involvement including the kidneys, heart, and/or brain about a decade later than the male patients [5, 6].The typical cardiac AFD manifestation is concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in up to 50% of males and one-third of females, with or without right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as a result of the globotriaosylceramide accumulation in cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, conduction tissue, and valvular fibroblasts with consequent complex cellular cascades and a final result of hypertrophy and fibrosis [2, 7]. ECG abnormalities, echocardiographic findings, and arrhythmias are part of clinical presentations depending on the disease stage. A typical cardiac symptom is angina as a result of microvascular disease, while myocardial infarction is uncommon [2, 8–10].Everyday clinical practice in AFD detection is challenging because of several reasons: various clinical manifestations depending on gender, age, time of detection, and type of disease [11]. Disease severity variations (symptoms, ECG changes, echocardiographic signs, and presence of arrhythmias), together with other organ involvement, can lead to disease presentations with unique profiles, especially if we take into account alpha-galactosidase activity levels, biomarker lyso-GL-3 levels, and results of genetic testing. This case series presents 4 patients with different cardiovascular presentations (Table 1).A 72-year-old female presented with a personal history of hypohidrosis and acroparesthesia from childhood, started with antihypertensive medication, ramipril 1.25 mg, because of LVH and a mild level of hypertension 10 years ago. Also, laboratory analysis showed increased blood levels of creatinine (211 µmol/L) and endogenous creatinine clearance (22.8 mL/min/1.73 m2) with proteinuria (174 mg/24 h). In 2013 and 2014, she had episodes of chest pain and dyspnea with increased levels of cardiac troponin and electrocardiogram changes (predominant left ventricular hypertrophy with negative T waves). On both occasions, she was admitted into the coronary unit with a working diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. Coronary angiography was performed twice and showed no epicardial coronary artery stenosis, with developed smaller coronary arteries. During the past 2 years, she had several recidives of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, started with oral anticoagulation. In last 10 years, echo examination was repeated several times, and every time significant LVH was described (LV mass calculated 305 g) while RVH was not. At the moment of detection, she had reduced ejection fraction of the left ventricle according to strain echo. Afterwards, testing for AFD was performed: alpha-galactosidase level was decreased (0.03 nmol/spot/21 h; normal range >0.185 nmol/spot/21 h) and a heterozygous mutation was detected (c.[758T>C]). Family screening test for sister and two sons were negative (Figures 1(a)–1(c)).A 62-year-old man presented with a personal history of hypohidrosis and acroparesthesia from childhood, hypertension over the last 20 years, started with cardiologic controls because of palpitations and dyspnea 20 years ago. At the moment of detection, he had persistent atrial fibrillation. He previously suffered an ischemic stroke, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with percutaneous coronary intervention of the right coronary artery, had an implanted cardiac pacemaker because of sick sinus syndrome, increased blood levels of creatinine (116 µmol/L) and endogenous creatinine clearance (78.6 mL/min/1.73 m2) with proteinuria (454 mg/24 h), without ophthalmological and dermatological manifestations of the disease. Repeated echo examination showed significant LVH without left ventricular outflow obstruction, decreased EF according to strain analysis, diastolic dysfunction of the first degree, and degenerative, moderate level of aortic valve stenosis. The patient was hospitalized for two more times because of chest pain with increased troponin levels. Afterwards, testing for Fabry disease was performed: alpha-galactosidase level was decreased (0.06 nmol/spot/21 h; normal range >0.12 nmol/spot/21 h), lyso-GL-3 was increased (36.1 ng/mL; normal range 0.0–3.5 ng/mL), and a hemizygous mutation was detected (c.[902G>T]) (Figures 2(a)–2(c)) [12].An asymptomatic 45-year-old female was detected to be heterozygous during family screening (AFD affected father). Echocardiographic examination showed thickened mitral papillary muscle, LV wall thickness 11/12 mm, and mild degree of diastolic dysfunction. Testing for AF disease was performed: alpha-galactosidase level was normal (0.2 nmol/spot/21 h; normal range >0.12 nmol/spot/21 h) and a heterozygous mutation was detected (c.[902G>T]). Thereafter, heart MRI was performed; there was no late gadolinium enhancement or signs of myocardial fibrosis, examination considered as completely normal. Furthermore, brain MRI was normal. Renal biopsy showed typical zebra bodies located in podocytes and partly in epithelial tubular cells. Laboratory analysis showed normal renal function: creatinine level 76 µmol/L, endogenous creatinine clearance 81 mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria 5.1 mg/L, and proteinuria 78 mg/24 h (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)).A 75-year-old female, heterozygote for AFD, detected in family screening, had hypertension history for over 20 years, atrial fibrillation, and dyspnea with signs of progressive heart failure of unknown cause during the past 10 years. Heart surgery was performed because of higher level of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation—mitral and tricuspid valve annuloplasty, before AFD detection. She had acroparestesia from childhood. According to earlier medical documentation, creatinine level was 125 µmol/L, and proteinuria was described a bit over the reference values. The patient was not interested in further examinations. Echocardiographic examination was performed before testing: there were no typical signs of AFD, and she had moderate LVH with hyperechogenic/hypokinetic LV walls and reduced ejection fraction of left ventricle 30% according to two-dimensional transthoracic. Testing for Fabry disease was performed: alpha-galactosidase level was normal (1.7 µmol/L/h; normal range >1.2 µmol/L/h), lyso-GL-3 was increased (7.5 ng/mL; normal range 0.0–3.5 ng/mL), and a heterozygous mutation was detected (c.[902G>T]) (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)).Patients with AFD are usually detected during different times of their life and in different stages of the disease when typical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not always present (early or late stages).The typical cardiac type of AFD presents with concentric or sometimes asymmetric LVH, with or without RVH. ECG changes include voltage signs of LVH/RVH, repolarization abnormalities, PR shortening, and different types of benign and malignant arrhythmias. Atherosclerotic coronary disease is not typical for AFD, but involvement of coronary microcirculation can lead to angina [2]. In the clinical routine, most patients are first evaluated with two-dimensional echocardiography. The echocardiographic determination is limited to morphology and function but without exact etiology determination. Cardiac magnetic resonance can evaluate the presence or absence of hyperenhancement and its location. Intramural or subepicardial areas of hyperenhancement, which are not related to any coronary perfusion territory, are typical for infiltrative disorders such as AFD. Additional valuable information can be gained by this examination, including information about the area of irreversible myocardial damage and prognosis, the amount of scarring, and the clinical risk for sudden death [13].The hallmarks of AF cardiomyopathy (increasing wall thickness, regional functional abnormalities, and replacement fibrosis) during aging are not the same for both sexes. In male patients, the LV starts to hypertrophy during adolescence with concomitant reduction in longitudinal function. During aging, these two processes lead to replacement fibrosis. In females, the progression toward hypertrophy is prolonged, whereas the development of fibrosis and regional functional abnormalities progresses simultaneously [14]. Replacement fibrosis may be a valid screening tool in females as opposed to males in the early stages of AFD [15].Symptoms and results of cardiac imaging may be different than expected: echocardiogram after cardiac surgery, coronary angiogram after percutaneous coronary intervention, or electrocardiogram after pacemaker implantation, and this can delay clinical assumptions and the decision for genetic testing.A cardiologist is usually the first person who can raise suspicion about an AFD etiology in HCM with the help of transthoracic echocardiography. Knowing and thinking about HCM differential diagnoses is crucial. According to ESC HCM guidelines, in over 60% of adults with HCM, the disease is an autosomal dominant trait caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes; in 5–10%, it is caused by other genetic disorders including inherited metabolic and neuromuscular diseases, chromosome abnormalities, and genetic syndromes; and about 25–30% are still of unknown cause [16]. In routine practice, the most common conditions causing LVH are arterial hypertension, aortic stenosis, and obesity [2].In differential diagnosis, it is obligatory to expand our thoughts on several more facts about Anderson-Fabry disease: (1) gender difference (inheritance); (2) age difference (time of clinical presentation); (3) disease burden (depending on the affected organs and degrees of changes); (4) individual manifestation (unique pathophysiologic personal profiles); (5) presence of comorbidities (coexistence of different cardiovascular diseases).From a cardiac point of view, patients with unexplained ventricular hypertrophy should be tested for AFD, even without other organ affection because of different genotypes and phenotypes of the disease. Patients with atypical echocardiographic LVH findings, with other organ affection, should also be tested for AFD, especially after invasive/operative cardiac therapeutic procedures.The author declares that there are no conflicts of interest.
Emergency Valve-in-Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for the Treatment of Acute Stentless Bioprosthetic Aortic Insufficiency and Cardiogenic Shock

Such patients may be unsuitable for emergency valve replacement surgery due to excessive risk of operative mortality but could be treatable with transfemoral valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). There is a paucity of data regarding the feasibility of valve-in-valve TAVI in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock due to acute aortic insufficiency from stentless bioprosthetic valve degeneration. We present one such case, highlighting the unique aspects of valve-in-valve TAVI for this challenging patient subset.Acute severe aortic regurgitation is an emergency necessitating immediate intervention due to the inability of the left ventricle to adapt to the sudden increase in preload and left ventricular diastolic pressure, which ultimately results in pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. Pharmacologic preload and postload reduction can temporize clinical deterioration, but only valve replacement can abort the inevitable hemodynamic collapse. We present a case of successful valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for a structurally deteriorated Medtronic Freestyle stentless bioprosthesis in a patient presenting with severe aortic regurgitation and cardiogenic shock. Due to clinical presentation in extremis and presence of stentless bioprosthetic degeneration, the case presented unique challenges that highlight important aspects of preprocedural care, heart team collaboration, imaging guidance, and implantation technique.The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and bicuspid aortic valve status post aortic valve and root replacement using a 23 mm Freestyle (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) aortic valve and root bioprosthesis implanted by root inclusion method 12 years prior to admission. She was transferred from an outside hospital with acute-onset chest pain and shortness of breath. She denied fever and chills. Physical examination was notable for blood pressure 100/30 mmHg and hypoxia. Grade 3/6 systolic and diastolic murmurs were heard at the right 2nd intercostal space. Subsequently, she developed pulmonary edema and shock necessitating mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. A transthoracic echocardiogram suggested flail aortic valve leaflet (Video 1), and transaortic Doppler signal was suggestive of wide-open aortic regurgitation (Figure 1).Due to rapid deterioration of the patient, the heart team was immediately organized. Two cardiac surgeons deemed her unsuitable for redo surgical aortic valve replacement (Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted operative mortality >50%). Therefore, valve-in-valve TAVI was considered. After review of the operative report and manufacturer product information, the inner diameter of the Freestyle valve was confirmed to be 20 mm. A 23 mm S3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) was selected. Images from a remote contrast-enhanced CT scan suggested absence of peripheral arterial calcification and adequate caliber of iliofemoral arteries for large-bore sheath insertion.Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used to guide the procedure. The etiology of valve deterioration was confirmed to be leaflet flail; no vegetations were identified. Arterial and venous access was obtained followed by placement of a transvenous pacemaker. Aortography was performed (Video 2), followed by insertion of a 14 F × 36 cm E sheath (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). The 23 mm S3 valve was implanted during rapid pacing, using nominal inflation volume (Video 3). Of note, wide pulse pressure was observed even during pacing at 200 beats per minute. Pre-TAVI central aortic pressure was 114/30 mmHg, and left ventricular pressure was 120/30 mmHg (Figure 2(a)). Post-TAVI central aortic pressure was 90/40 mmHg with a left ventricular pressure of 90/13 mmHg (Figure 2(b)). The final TEE images and aortogram showed trivial aortic regurgitation (Figures 2(c)–2(f)). Blood cultures, which had been obtained at presentation, were negative. The patient was discharged home in stable condition after 7 days. At a 30-day postprocedure follow-up visit, she was asymptomatic and had returned to working as a teacher. An echocardiogram at that time revealed normal left ventricular size and function, no aortic insufficiency, mean transaortic gradient 12 mmHg, and calculated aortic valve area 1.0 cm2 (Video 4, Figure 3).Several large, multicenter registries have demonstrated that valve-in-valve TAVI is safe and effective in stable patients with degenerated aortic bioprostheses [1–4]. In an analysis from the Global Valve-in-Valve Registry, Dvir and colleagues demonstrated excellent 1-year survival in such patients (83.2%; 95% CI, 80.8%–84.7%) [2]. One-year survival for patients with pure insufficiency as the mode of bioprosthetic failure was even more favorable (91.2%; 95% CI, 85.7%–96.7%). Of patients with pure insufficiency, 36.7% had New York Heart Association (NYHA) 4 symptoms (number of patients in shock was not reported), and 29.6% had stentless valve degeneration.In contrast to more stable patients with failed stented bioprostheses, valve-in-valve TAVI for acute, severe aortic insufficiency and cardiogenic shock due to stentless bioprosthetic degeneration represents a particularly challenging TAVI subset, and published data are limited to a few case reports. Bagur and colleagues [5] treated a patient with 15-year old degenerated 23 mm Medtronic Freestyle (Minneapolis, Minnesota) who presented with hemodynamically unstable pulmonary edema. They used a 23 mm Edwards SAPIEN XT (Edwards Lifesciences Inc., Irvine, California). Since there was relative lack of calcification in the body of the prosthesis, valve positioning was facilitated by a pigtail catheter left in the right sinus of Valsalva until the SAPIEN XT was half deployed, and the operators used a very slow deployment technique. Chevalier and colleagues [6] treated a patient presenting with shock and acute aortic insufficiency due to a deteriorated 19 mm Freestyle valve with a 23 mm SAPIEN XT valve with 5 cc less than nominal inflation volume; a transcatheter valve with a smaller diameter was not used due to patient-prosthesis mismatch at baseline. The hemodynamic result was acceptable (shock resolved, residual 25 mmHg mean transaortic gradient with no aortic insufficiency), and the patient was free of heart failure at 6-month follow-up. Finally, Duncan et al. [7] reported a series of valve-in-valve TAVI in 22 patients with failing stentless bioprostheses, one of which had a failed 25 mm homograft and presented with acute aortic insufficiency and cardiogenic shock. Extracorporeal circulatory support was used before and after TAVI, which utilized a 29 mm Medtronic Corevalve (Minneapolis, Minnesota). The Corevalve was 4.4% oversized based on the perimeter of the homograft annulus. All patients in the series, including this one, were alive at 30 days.Emergency valve-in-valve TAVI in a patient with acute, severe aortic insufficiency and cardiogenic shock presents unique technical challenges. Preprocedural stabilization in the crucial moments prior to TAVI must include airway intubation and hemodynamic support. Pharmacologic vasopressor support may be necessary in the short term to increase central aortic pressure and perfuse vital organs. Intra-aortic balloon pump and transaortic axial flow pumps (such as Impella (Danvers, Massachusetts)) are generally contraindicated. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be effective as a temporizing measure, as was reported by Duncan et al. [7], but an arterio-venous circuit in a beating heart would be expected to ultimately lead to worsening aortic regurgitation and pump failure [8]. Therefore, timely aortic valve replacement is the key to survival. With the airway secured, TEE can confirm the etiology of leaflet degeneration (i.e., whether due to a purely mechanical problem or endocarditis), visualize the sewing ring of the stentless valve (invisible by fluoroscopy), and may be helpful in coordinating the appropriate TAVI implant height. Preprocedural CT angiography, while ideal for planning stentless (or stented) valve-in-valve TAVI in more stable patients, is not feasible for patients in shock. Transfemoral access is the least invasive and likely to be the best tolerated large-bore vascular access for hemodynamically unstable patients. Although low mean systemic blood pressure was achieved with pacing at 200 bpm, pulse pressure remained relatively wide. This was likely the result of hyperdynamic ventricular contractility and stroke volume due to inotropic agents and severe aortic insufficiency, respectively. Despite this, the balloon-expandable transcatheter valve remained in a stable position throughout deployment.In contrast to stented aortic prostheses, stentless prostheses do not have radiopaque markings to fluroscopically guide transcatheter valve implantation depth. The exception may be if there is heavy calcification in the body of the prosthesis. Importantly, the sewing ring may be more ventricular than the calcium landmarks in the body of the prosthesis, so a combination of TEE and aortography, with one or two pigtail catheters to locate the sewing ring relative to the root, may be useful [9]. For stable patients with stentless valve degeneration, self-expanding, recapturable transcatheter valves have been successfully used for valve-in-valve TAVI [10–12]. However, balloon-expandable valves have also been used with good results [5]. In the present case, oversizing of the S3 valve relative to the Freestyle inner diameter (23 mm versus 20 mm, resp.) provided some reassurance that device migration or embolization would be unlikely. Furthermore, baseline echocardiography and aortography (in lieu of CT angiography) suggested that the sinuses of Valsalva appeared to be sufficiently spacious and the height of the coronary ostia from the annulus appeared grossly adequate to accommodate the 23 mm S3 valve without causing coronary artery obstruction from the degenerated prosthetic valve leaflets. Fortunately, the aortogram (double the normal contrast volume was used for the injection) nicely opacified the sewing ring of the Freestlye prosthesis which was approximately 2 mm below the bottom of the pigtail catheter in the aortic root. Alignment of the middle marker of the S3 balloon catheter with this plane resulted in perfect implantation depth.We present a challenging case of emergency valve-in-valve TAVI in a stentless bioprosthesis for a patient presenting with severe aortic regurgitation and cardiogenic shock using a balloon-expandable transcatheter valve. This case adds to the experience of the few reported cases of valve-in-valve TAVI for this uniquely challenging patient subset. Prompt diagnosis, preprocedural airway and hemodynamic stabilization, immediate heart team collaboration, and skillful use of invasive and noninvasive imaging were all instrumental in achieving a successful outcome.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.The authors would like to acknowledge Drs.

A Combination of Tachycardia-Mediated Heart Failure and Coronary Artery Vasospasm-Induced Silent Myocardial Infarction in a Patient with Severe Thyrotoxicosis
1Endocrinology Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital II, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia2Cardiology Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital II, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, MalaysiaCorrespondence should be addressed to Serena Sert Kim Khoo; moc.liamtekcor@vil_ksReceived 30 November 2017; Revised 3 February 2018; Accepted 6 February 2018; Published 11 March 2018Academic Editor: Manabu ShirotaniCopyright © 2018 Serena Sert Kim Khoo et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Severe thyrotoxicosis can present with a myriad of cardiovascular complications. It may be mild features such as palpitations, tachycardia, and exertional dyspnea or may progress to life-threatening consequences such as atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmias, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and shock. In rare cases, they may present with myocardial ischemia secondary to coronary artery vasospasm. We report a case of a 59-year-old Malay gentleman who presented with fast atrial fibrillation and tachycardia-mediated heart failure that evolved to a silent myocardial infarction secondary to severe coronary artery vasospasm with undiagnosed severe thyrotoxicosis. He had complete resolution of heart failure and no further recurrence of coronary artery vasospasm once treatment for thyrotoxicosis was initiated and euthyroidism achieved. This life-threatening consequence has an excellent prognosis if recognised early and treated promptly.The cardiovascular manifestations from hyperthyroidism are well described and may include palpitations, tachycardia, exercise intolerance, dyspnea on exertion, widened pulse pressure, and atrial fibrillation that can evolve to tachyarrhythmias, heart failure, cardiovascular collapse, and shock in the acute setting of thyroid storm [1]. In rare instances, patients with hyperthyroidism can experience angina suggestive of myocardial ischemia either due to known or suspected underlying ischemic heart disease or secondary to coronary artery vasospasm (CAS) [2].We report the case of a patient with severe thyrotoxicosis who presented with a spectrum of cardiovascular complications of fast atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure who developed silent acute myocardial infarction as a consequence of severe diffuse coronary artery vasospasm.A 59-year-old previously healthy Malay gentleman presented with progressive worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for 1 month. He had no angina, palpitations, or ankle oedema. He had a 20-pack-year smoking history but had no other cardiovascular risk factors. He also had epigastric discomfort and vomiting.Physical examination revealed a thin, restless but oriented man. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 130/87 mmHg, irregular pulse rate of 150 beats/min, respiratory rate of 32/min, and temperature of 37.3°C. Cardiovascular examination revealed a raised jugular venous pressure, displaced apex beat, bibasal crepitations, and minimal ankle oedema. His baseline laboratory findings on admission are listed in Table 1.ECG on presentation showed fast atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 156 beats per minute (Figure 1). Chest X-ray revealed signs of pulmonary congestion and cardiomegaly. Echocardiography showed mild to moderate left ventricular dysfunction with left ventricular ejection function of 40–50% with moderate mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and impaired right ventricular function. The mean estimated pulmonary artery pressure is 31 mmHg. No diastolic study was done in view of atrial fibrillation.He was admitted and stabilised in the CCU and commenced on intravenous frusemide infusion, spironolactone 12.5 mg daily, carvedilol 9.375 mg twice daily, perindopril 2 mg daily, and thiamine and anticoagulated with s/c Clexane. The next day, he was noted to have fluctuating ST segment elevation on the cardiac monitor but was asymptomatic. An immediate ECG revealed marked ST segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and V1–V4 with ST depression in I, aVL, and V5-V6 with atrial fibrillation and bradycardia (Figure 2). Minutes later, he developed cardiogenic shock with a blood pressure of 68/43 mmHg and bradycardia.An immediate coronary angiography was performed which revealed diffuse coronary artery vasospasm. Diffuse small caliber vessels were demonstrated in the left coronary artery (Figure 3(a)) and the right coronary artery (Figure 3(b)). Following intracoronary injection of 200 mcg nitroglycerin, the caliber of the vessel improved significantly as visualized in Figure 3(c) for the left coronary artery and Figure 3(d) for the right coronary artery. There was improvement in myocardial brushing, and no coronary artery stenosis was seen. He was commenced on continuous nitroglycerin infusion, and ST elevation reduced remarkably after coronary angiogram.He developed transient episodes of bradycardia after procedure and required IV atropine and IV adrenaline and brief cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The patient was treated with IV infusion of nitroglycerin and titrated according to the ECG and clinical symptoms.Later, on further questioning, he had thyrotoxic symptoms of heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss, and muscle weakness for several months. He had not noticed any neck swelling, obstructive symptoms, or visual symptoms. On reexamination, he had fine tremors, lid retraction, lid lag, and bilateral mild proptosis to suggest Graves’ ophthalmopathy. There was a grade II diffuse goiter with no thyroid bruit. His Burch-Wartofsky score was 65 (>45) (Table 2).Thyroid function test results were as follows: free T4 61.6 pmol/L (normal range: 9–25), free T3 21.8 pmol/L (normal range: 3.5–6.5), and TSH 0.001 uIU/ml (normal range: 0.4–4.7). There was no TSH receptor antibody level.He was commenced on IV hydrocortisone, carbimazole, oral Lugol’s iodine, propranolol, Cardiprin, warfarin, and oral mononitrates. He improved remarkably with complete resolution of hyperthyroid and heart failure symptoms 3 weeks after. He reverted back to sinus rhythm, and his repeat echocardiogram showed marked improvement of his left ventricular and right ventricular function, LVEF 60–65%, and pulmonary pressure not raised demonstrated by no significant TR and PR. His thyroid function test 2 months after improved with FT4 15.21 pmol/L (9–19) and TSH < 0.01 uIU/ml, and he was scheduled for a radioactive iodine therapy.This report highlights a spectrum of cardiac complications in a patient with delayed diagnosis of severe thyrotoxicosis presenting with fast atrial fibrillation and heart failure evolving into a painless acute myocardial infarction secondary to diffuse severe coronary vasospasm.Thyrotoxicosis affects the cardiovascular system via T3-mediated effects by increasing cardiac contractility, enhancing systolic and diastolic function, decreasing systemic vascular resistance and increasing circulating blood volume leading to increased preload, decreased afterload, and therefore increasing cardiac output by up to 300% from a euthyroid state [3].This patient presented with classical tachycardia-mediated heart failure and fast atrial fibrillation. This mechanism led to an increased level of cytosolic calcium during diastole with reduced ventricular contractility and diastolic dysfunction. Increase in pulmonary artery pressure as in this case is contributory and a recognised cause of isolated right heart failure. In addition, 5% to 15% of thyrotoxic patients with atrial fibrillation are most likely to develop heart failure [3]. Beta-blockers can provide immediate relief of heart failure symptoms by slowing the heart rate and improving left ventricular function; however, cautious use in patients with true heart failure is advised. Marked symptoms resolution is seen upon attaining euthyroidism [4].This case was further complicated with the development of painless acute myocardial infarction secondary to diffuse severe coronary vasospasm. The prevalence rate of coronary artery vasospasm with thyrotoxicosis is reported about 7.4% occurring more frequently in females, with age ranging between 44 and 75 years, and in Asians [5]. Smoking is a major risk factor for coronary artery vasospasm, and in this case it may be contributory [6].Patients with coronary vasospasm with thyrotoxicosis typically present with either resting or exertional angina or syncope. However, it is important to note that the incidence of silent myocardial ischemia secondary to coronary vasospasm is more than twice than that of symptomatic ischemia [7] as in this case where the phenomenon was detected incidentally from ECG or cardiac monitoring.Lee et al. described that coronary vasospasm with thyrotoxicosis presented with a higher incidence of acute myocardial infarction and angiographically had normal coronary arteries and were more spontaneous, diffuse, involving the left main vessel, and medically intractable compared to those without thyrotoxicosis [8]. This patient’s presentation and angiographic findings were spontaneous, diffuse, and involving both coronary arteries and responded remarkably to intracoronary nitroglycerin.The mechanism for the intensive spasm is still unclear. However, Napoli et al. demonstrated that vascular endothelium is a specific target of thyroid hormone evidenced by marked basal vasodilation contributed by excessive endothelial nitric oxide production coupled by exaggerated vascular reactivity because of enhanced sensitivity of the endothelial component and increased vasoconstrictory response to norepinephrine during the hyperthyroid state. This abnormal vasoconstrictory response reverses when euthyroidism is achieved [9]. This phenomenon not only involves the coronary arteries but also reported cerebrovascular occlusive disease (Moyamoya phenomenon) in uncontrolled Graves’ disease that may share the same mechanism for acute vasospasm of the cerebral arteries [2].Even though the clinical presentation of tachycardia-mediated heart failure along with CAS with thyrotoxicosis was severe, the clinical course became stable with excellent prognosis once the patient achieved euthyroidism [10, 11]. An important lesson to learn is the prompt clinical recognition and diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis as a cause of heart failure and coronary vasospasm. In this case, once the diagnosis of severe thyrotoxicosis was made and treatment initiated, the patient gradually improved with resolution of heart failure and hyperthyroid symptoms, reversion back to sinus rhythm, and improvement in echocardiogram findings and thyroid function levels.Severe thyrotoxicosis can manifest with a myriad of cardiac complications. Tachycardia-mediated heart failure along with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery vasospasm is a life-threatening consequence of thyrotoxicosis, and the delay in diagnosis and treatment of hyperthyroidism in these patients may result in complications and unnecessary interventions. However, if recognised and treated early, it can lead to excellent prognosis.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Persistent Hiccups as the Only Presenting Symptom of ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction

Patients can present with dyspnea, fatigue, heart burn, diaphoresis, syncope, and abdominal pain to name a few. Our patient was a 74-year-old male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD due to chronic tobacco use, who presented with persistent hiccups for 4 days and no other complaints. Coincidently, he was found to have a diabetic foot ulcer with sepsis and acute kidney injury and hence was admitted to the hospital. A routine 12-lead EKG was done, and he was found to have an inferior wall ST elevation myocardial infarction. He underwent diagnostic catheterization which demonstrated 100% right coronary artery occlusion and a thallium viability study which confirmed nonviable myocardium; hence, he did not undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. Elderly patients who present with persistent hiccups should be investigated for an underlying cardiac etiology.This case report aims to spread awareness amongst the emergency department physicians and primary care physicians who often encounter patients with symptoms which seem trivial but have a grave underlying pathology. Persistent hiccups is one of them. Our case report highlights a patient who came in with similar complaints and was found to have an acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction of the inferior wall. Persistent hiccups in the elderly with risk factors for coronary artery disease should be investigated further.A 74-year-old male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD from chronic tobacco use came with complaints of persistent hiccups for 4 days and no other complaints. Coincidently, he was noted to have a diabetic foot ulcer on the right great toe. On admission, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 96/62 mm Hg and a heart rate of 72 beats per minute. Laboratory tests which included a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and urinalysis were significant for a WBC count of 16 × 103/μL, creatinine of 1.29 mg/dL which was acute, and a lactic acid level of 2.3 mmol/L. The rest of the laboratory tests and chest X-ray were normal. Blood cultures were sent immediately and had no growth over the course of hospital stay. The admitting diagnosis was sepsis from a diabetic foot ulcer, and the patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime.Blood cultures showed no growth, and on the basis of wound cultures showing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, doxycycline was substituted. A routine 12-lead EKG was performed on admission which showed ST elevation in inferior leads with Q waves and sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block (Figure 1) with troponin-I levels of 38.22 ng/dl, suggestive of a recent age indeterminate inferior wall ST elevation myocardial infarction. He was given intravenous unfractionated heparin, aspirin, and ticagrelor. Lactic acid trended down within 4 hours. Hiccups resolved on day 2 of hospital stay, and troponins started to trend down within 6 hours of presentation. Echocardiogram showed LVEF of 30% with inferior wall akinesia. After the resolution of sepsis and acute kidney injury, diagnostic cardiac catheterization was performed which showed 100% mid-right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion (Figure 2), inferior wall akinesis, and 80% mid-left anterior descending (LAD) lesion (Figure 3), and ischemic cardiomyopathy was confirmed. A nuclear regadenoson stress test was performed which showed large inferoseptal wall defect with akinesia and surrounding anteroseptal wall hypokinesia (Figure 4). To rule out hibernating myocardium, a thallium viability scan was performed which showed a fixed inferoseptal and apical perfusion abnormality with no redistribution in 24-hour delayed imaging. As no viable tissue in the infarcted area was identified and there was no ischemic myocardium, medical therapy was recommended. The patient was discharged with an external cardiac defibrillator vest (LifeVest), and later on, he had an implantable cardiac defibrillator placed when there was no improvement in ejection fraction despite maximal medical therapy for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. The patient continues to do well on therapy and close follow-up.Our patient only complained of hiccups and displayed no other symptoms that would indicate myocardial ischemia. Although our patient did not have any other symptoms to suggest acute coronary syndrome, the patient did have multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic smoking. “Anginal equivalent” is a term used for symptoms of acute coronary syndrome other than chest pain and includes dyspnea, fatigue, heart burn, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Acute coronary syndrome in diabetics, elderly, and female patients may present with such anginal equivalents [1]. Our patient was an elderly diabetic male who presented with a sole complaint of persistent hiccups and was found to have ST elevation myocardial infarction. Their resolution as the patient entered the convalescent stage of their AMI suggests that it was not a coincidence. None of the guidelines mention persistent hiccups as an anginal equivalent.Hiccups are defined as sudden onset of erratic diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle contraction, immediately followed by laryngeal closure leading to abrupt rush of air into the lungs eliciting a “hic” sound. Usually, they are self-limiting, but if episodes last >48 hours, they are defined as persistent hiccups [2]. The reflex arc of the hiccup has 3 components: the afferent limb composed of phrenic, vagus, and sympathetic nerves; a central processor in the mid-brain; and the efferent limb composed of the phrenic nerve supplying the diaphragm and intercostal nerves supplying the intercostal muscle fibers [3]. Any irritants in the reflex pathway, such as physical, chemical, inflammatory, or neoplastic process, can trigger hiccups. Most commonly, persistent hiccups are caused by the nervous system disorder, either central (neoplastic and inflammatory) or peripheral by irritation of the phrenic nerve (goiter) or irritation of the vagus nerve (otolaryngologic diseases, meningitis, esophageal, stomach, and duodenal diseases, hepatitis, pancreatitis, and enteritis) [4].This is the first case in literature in which ST segment elevation myocardial infarction presented with persistent hiccups as the sole presenting complaint. Myocardial ischemia has been reported to cause hiccups; however, there have been very few case reports in literature. Among the few reported cases, either hiccups was one of the associated symptoms in patients with myocardial ischemia or persistent hiccups presented as non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The earliest case report was in 1958, where a patient complained of dyspnea and orthopnea along with hiccups [5]. In 2 cases reported by Ikram et al. in 1971, patients developed intractable hiccups 2 to 3 days following acute inferoposterolateral and acute anterolateral MI, respectively [6]. Many other case reports cite hiccups as an associated symptom after admission for myocardial infarction [7, 8]. In a case reported by Davenport et al. in 2012, similar to our case, the patient presented with persistent hiccups without any other complaints; however, the patient was found to have inferior wall NSTEMI, and a subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed significant stenosis of the left circumflex and first obtuse marginal coronary arteries [9]. Zhang et al. reported a case of persistent hiccups with chest pain in a patient with cocaine-induced inferior wall STEMI with 99% occlusion of the mid-RCA and 80% stenosis of the LAD artery [4].It is interesting to note that all the published literature about persistent hiccups and myocardial ischemia has identified the inferior wall of the myocardium to be affected. The inferior wall also known as the diaphragmatic surface of the heart lies in close proximity to the diaphragm. Irritation of phrenic nerves, which innervates the diaphragm, can be the cause of persistent hiccups in these patients. The other probable reason could be irritation of the vagus nerve supplying the pericardium [10].Whether it is the inflammatory markers released from the infarcted inferior myocardium which irritate the diaphragm and trigger the hiccup reflex arc or it is the irritation of the vagus nerve directly remains to be elucidated [11]. In one of the case reports where both RCA and LAD were occluded, the symptoms of hiccups resolved after opening of only RCA even when LAD remained obstructed. This supports our observation of inferior wall MI causing hiccups [12]. This case reminds us of importance of having a high index of suspicion, especially in elderly diabetic patients where benign self-limiting condition like hiccups can be the only presenting symptoms of a serious underlying pathology like ST elevation myocardial infarction.Whilst there are more common causes of acute onset persistent hiccups, if there are no other obvious causes, acute myocardial ischemia should be considered as a potential differential.Written informed consent was obtained from the patient (or other approved parties) for publication of this case report and accompanying images.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Nasreen Shaikh was the primary resident taking care of the patient and wrote the case report.

The diagnosis is often incidental as in this case, which presented with an acute coronary syndrome as a manifestationof multivessel coronary artery disease. Here, we present the challenges encountered during the diagnosis and management of this entity via percutaneous intervention.Right-sided heart is a rare congenital anomaly that is related to malposition of the internal organs, and it can be found usually with all the organs changed in the opposite direction, known as situs inversus totalis (mirror-image dextrocardia) or less commonly as isolated dextrocardia in situs solitus (dextroversion) [1]. Mirror-image dextrocardia (situs inversus) has an incidence of associated congenital heart disease same as normal population, usually does not affect survival, and can be incidentally found in the presence of a cardiothoracic pathology such as coronary artery disease [2]. This situation offers a technical challenge to interventional cardiologists. Here, we describe a patient with postinfarction unstable angina having situs inversus with coronary artery disease, treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The challenges in the diagnosis and treatment by an endovascular approach imposed by the anatomical changes of the usual topography of the heart and the presence of multivessel coronary artery disease as a very unusual presentation are shown and discussed.A 69-year-old Afro-American man was admitted in the emergency department of a public institution in Port of Spain, Trinidad, in February 2015 with EKG findings consistent of an acute coronary syndrome: an inferior wall ST elevation myocardial infarction (inferior STEMI). The symptoms of chest pain initiated 5 hours before admission, he was in Killip-Kimball class I, and he received thrombolytic therapy with Tenecteplase, with clinical, ECG, and biomarkers criteria of successful reperfusion and good clinical in-hospital outcome; primary PCI was not performed because there was not a catheterization laboratory available in that public hospital.The patient’s prior history is that he smokes 10 to 15 cigarettes a day for the last 15 years and had no previous heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia nor family history of early coronary artery disease. He was discharged with medical treatment since he had an uncomplicated inferior myocardial infarction (MI) that was stratified for noninvasive evaluation, but due to the presence of postmyocardial infarction effort angina 5 days after discharge, he was admitted to Caribbean Heart Care Medcorp (CHCM) at St. Clair Medical Centre Hospital for diagnostic catheterization. The EKG revealed sinus rhythm with an inverted p wave in DI, aVL, and aVR, with right axis deviation, positive QRS complex in aVR, and poor progression of r waves in precordial leads and signs consistent of a prior inferior MI with q waves at DII, DIII, and aVF. The TIMI risk score was 2 (8% risk of event at 30 days). The EKG findings made us suspicious of a malposition syndrome (Figure 1).The physical exam with right-sided heart sounds, including a 4th heart sound and a right-sided apex with a palpable liver in the left side, and the radiogram findings with right-sided cardiac apex and gastric chamber Figure 2 confirmed our suspicion of situs inversus totalis, which was an incidental diagnosis.Coronary angiography was performed via femoral access using the standard Judkins technique [3] with 6 French catheters (Judkins left: JL 4.0 and Judkins right: JR 3.5), which showed right-sided aortic arch and mirror image of coronary circulation. Horizontal axis mirror-image inversion of the angiographic views was used. A two-vessel coronary artery disease was diagnosed. There were a significant 70% stenosis at the proximal segment of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and a right coronary artery (RCA) 90% stenosis in the distal segment.On May 25, 2015, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with an extra-backup support EBU 3.5, 6 French guiding catheter with the standard Judkins technique, using inverted horizontal axis angiographic views of the left coronary artery, to mimic a left anterior oblique (LAO) with a cranial view for the left anterior descending artery (LAD), an inverted view; that is, to the other side, a right anterior oblique (RAO) view was used, to proceed with a direct stenting of the proximal segment stenosis of the LAD, implanting a 2.5 × 16 mm drug-eluting (everolimus) stent (Promus Premier, Boston Scientific) successfully (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Then, we proceeded to treat the right coronary artery 90% distal segment stenosis; for this, we used a right Judkins 3.5, 6F guiding catheter with horizontal mirror imaging, using a RAO view to mimic the LAO view; the anatomical right coronary artery was engaged easily using an opposite maneuver to the usual, with the tip of the catheter pointing leftward and rotated counterclockwise (instead of rotating clockwise), and then, we passed a Whisper 0.014 angioplasty guidewire and crossed the distal stenosis; predilatation was done with a 1.5 × 10 mm balloon (Apex, Boston Scientific), and then, a 2.5 × 12 mm zotarolimus-eluting stent (Resolute Integrity, Medtronic) was successfully implanted, obtaining excellent angiographic results and final TIMI grade 3 flow (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)).The patient had an excellent in-hospital follow-up, without any symptoms and complications; there was no rise in cardiac biomarkers and was discharged after 48 hrs. With life style modification and receiving coated aspirin 81 mg/d, clopidogrel 75 mg/d, and atorvastatin 80 mg/d, a 3-month follow-up showed no recurrent ischemia, and a treadmill stress test (positioning electrodes to the right side) was performed which was negative.Dextrocardia is a rare cardiac anomaly of development, characterized by an opposite orientation of the apex to the usual one; it is in the right hemithorax, with its axis directed to the right and caudally. This can occur with situs solitus or more frequently in association with situs viscerum inversus totalis (all the organs inverted); it can also be found as situs ambiguous. With situs solitus and situs inversus, the atrial situs always corresponds to the visceral situs; with situs ambiguous, the arrangement of the organs is not as ordered, and the relation between the atria and the viscera is inconsistent [1, 2, 4]. Dextrocardia with situs inversus is an infrequent condition occurring with an estimated range of 1 : 8000 to 1 : 10,000. In situs inversus totalis, the incidence of structural congenital heart disease is low, estimated to be near 3%. It is known that dextrocardia with situs inversus has a 15% association of another rare disease that affects primarily the respiratory tract and the epithelia of the sexual organs, the Kartagener syndrome (immotile cilia syndrome characterized by bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, and infertility in men). It is believed that these patients share the same risk as the general population to develop ischemic heart disease because of the high prevalence of atherosclerosis [4]. The majority of patients with dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis are ignorant of their variant anatomy until they are forced to seek medical attention, most frequently for cardiothoracic pathology [1, 4]. Our patient was not aware of his malposition syndrome until this admission, when he presented for the first time with acute coronary syndrome. The presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in this population presents several challenges to the interventional cardiologists due to the abnormal anatomic position of the heart, usually right position of the aortic arch and unfamiliar coronary anatomy especially at their origin. Once the diagnosis of dextrocardia is made in the context of an acute coronary syndrome, a reversed or right-sided ECG should be done; this will show the exact localization of the infarct in an ST elevation myocardial infarction, particularly if it is in the anterior and/or lateral wall [5].The first report of diagnostic cardiac catheterization in a patient with dextrocardia was done in 1973 by Hynes. Fourteen years later, Moreyra and coworkers in 1987 in the USA performed the first balloon angioplasty in a patient with dextrocardia and single-vessel CAD [6], and PCI with balloon angioplasty in a dextrocardia patient with multivessel CAD has been reported from Japan by Yoshimasa Yabe since 1995 [7, 8]. The first stent deployment in a patient with dextrocardia in situs inversus was performed in Italy by Patti et al. in 1999 [9].This is the first case of diagnostic and therapeutic catheterization of dextrocardia in situs inversus totalis documented in Trinidad. It was our first encounter with this rare scenario, so we had to search and review the literature to understand and approach this variety of presentation. We learned that, with the inversion technique of mirror-image views, it was easier to approach the lesions and that, with the RCA, the inverted maneuver of counterclockwise rotation as suggested by Gaglani et al. in 1989 [10] made the difference in engaging it. Note that with the image inversion technique, one gets a partly normalized intended view in the horizontal axis, but the apex is always pointing to the opposite side of the conventional angiogram; that is, to the right, to correct this, the double inversion technique was developed.Although we only used the inversion technique to facilitate the viewing, this does not normalize completely the views. There have been some advances applied to the newer fluoroscopy equipment such as the “horizontal sweep reverse” feature used in the method of double-inversion technique for coronary angiogram viewing in dextrocardia, developed by Goel. With this, the unfamiliar angulated coronary angiograms seen in dextrocardia are digitally corrected into a conventionally normal angiogram [11–12].In dextrocardia patients, there are several considerations that should be taken into account: (1) image acquisition, a mirror image between LAO and RAO; using an image reversal technology will give an advantage to the operator for the intervention; (2) the technique of torque of the catheter, a reverse maneuver of the usual between clockwise and counterclockwise rotation for the RCA; (3) transfemoral access gives a better access, even though some reports of transradial approach are also good for dextrocardia cases; and (4) anatomical variation in dextrocardia, variable position of the aortic arch (left/right), will require different catheter selection, that is, in the presence of a right aortic arch, as in this case, but in a case with an isolated right aortic arch, a left Judkins catheter can be used to selectively cannulate the left coronary artery and is also able to cannulate a right-sided right coronary artery [9–12].The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.The authors thank Iván Machado H., MD, Professor of Cardiology, Pediatric Cardiology Section, Head Cardiology Department, Universidad Central de Venezuela, for his observations and corrections made, as a pediatric interventional cardiologist point of view.
Safety and Efficacy of Triple Therapeutic Targets with Rivaroxaban after Acute Myocardial Infarction Complicated by Left Ventricular Thrombi in a Case of Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation
Department of Cardiology, San Eugenio Hospital, Rome, ItalyCorrespondence should be addressed to Francesco Summaria; moc.liamg@airammus.fReceived 5 December 2017; Accepted 14 January 2018; Published 5 March 2018Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2018 Francesco Summaria et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We present the complex case of a high-risk patient with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, who experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular (LV) thrombi and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent implantation. The patient was initially treated with short-term triple therapy including aspirin, clopidogrel, and rivaroxaban 15 mg/die. Following aspirin dropping one month after discharge, the patient continued on dual therapy with clopidogrel and rivaroxaban, and a clinical and imaging follow-up at 6 and 12 months confirmed the LV thrombi resolution, with no thromboembolic episodes and a good safety profile.Among acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), approximately 5% to 22% have concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) [1]. Among ACSs, AF is 2-fold more frequent during non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) than during STEMI [2]. Despite the overlap in the occurrence of these syndromes, the pharmacotherapies used to manage AF and ACSs differ.Left ventricular (LV) thrombi often represent an unexpected echocardiographic finding [3], accurately detected by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) [4]. Although the occurrence of this complication has declined significantly since the advent of primary PCI, its incidence is not negligible, ranging between 5% and 17% [5, 6].According to current guidelines, despite an increased rate of bleeding complications, warfarin is considered the anticoagulant of choice to prevent thromboembolic sequelae. As an advantageous alternative, the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been implemented in the setting of nonvalvular AF (NVAF) [7–9]. Yet, the evidence about their role in combination with antiplatelet agents in the management of LV thrombi for ACS patients undergoing PCI is poor, and mostly limited to case reports. Hence, their efficacy can be only extrapolated [10–13]. At present, two randomized trials (PIONEER AF-PCI and RE-Dual PCI) [14, 15] have demonstrated that the use of NOACs plus a P2Y12 inhibitor was associated with a lower rate of clinically significant bleeding, compared to VKAs plus dual antiplatelet therapy, thus ensuring a dual target of ischemic and thromboembolic protection against coronary and cerebrovascular events.We report the case of a 66-year-old woman, hypertensive, and smoker, referred to our Emergency Department for prolonged chest pain. Due to permanent NVAF, she was on warfarin and rate-control therapeutic strategy. At admission, electrocardiogram showed AF and a ST segment depression of 2 mm in V5-V6. The creatine kinase-MB was of 10 and high-sensitivity troponin I was of 6.0 ng/mL, with normal hemoglobin level and INR of 1.9. At baseline, a combined thromboembolic and bleeding scoring system evaluation was performed, resulting in a CHA2DS2-VASc of 4 and HAS-BLED of 3 [16–18]. A NSTEMI diagnosis was made, and an antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 300 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose, and intravenous unfractionated heparin 5000 IU was administered, while an early invasive strategy with a transradial approach was planned. The coronary angiography showed a normal right coronary artery and the occlusion of the left descending artery in the proximal segment (Figure 1(a)). An IVUS-guided PCI was performed, with the implantation of two overlapped last-generation DES (Xience Alpine, Abbott), 2.75 × 28 mm and 3.0 × 28 mm, respectively, both expanded up to 16 atmospheres. In order to optimize expansion and avoid malapposition, the stents were overexpanded, with noncompliant balloons of 3.5 × 15 mm (NC Quantum, Boston), up to 20 atmospheres, according to IVUS-guided vessel sizing.Considering the clinical setting (NSTEMI + AF) and the procedure (PCI with DES implantation), the antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 100 mg/day plus clopidogrel 75 mg/day was continued and anticoagulation with rivaroxaban 15 mg/day was started immediately after PCI. The transthoracic 2-D echocardiography revealed a hypokinesia of the apex and anterior wall with moderate reduction of the ejection fraction. Two mobile masses were found in the apex and in the anterior wall of the left ventricle, respectively (Figure 1(b)). A CMR was performed at day three, confirming apex and anterior wall hypokinesia and 40% ejection fraction. CMR unveiled the presence of two LV thrombi in the apex and along the anterior wall, respectively (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). TIR-T2 sequences showed myocardial oedema (Figure 1(e)) involving the LV anterior wall; delay enhancement (Figures 1(f) and 1(g)) revealed a thickness fibrosis in the same segment, with a hypoenhanced internal area suggesting microvascular obstruction. Three hyperenhancement focal areas were detected (Figure 1(h)): a transmural area at inferior apical septum, just beneath one thrombus, and two subepicardial areas, at anterior basal septum and at midanterior wall, respectively.The patient was discharged 7 days after admission. A clinical and cardiovascular imaging follow-up was planned at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year. According to current guidelines and expert consensus knowledge [19, 20], the antithrombotic/anticoagulant therapy was managed as follows: at 1 month, the thromboembolic and bleeding risk scores (CHA2DS2-VASc of 4 and HAS-BLED of 3) were rechecked, the antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel together with the anticoagulant therapy with rivaroxaban 15 mg/day was confirmed, and aspirin was stopped considering the high bleeding risk. At 6 months, no ischemic thromboembolic or bleeding events were reported. The echo and CMR imaging confirmed the resolution of the LV thrombi. Despite the fact that MRI are not necessary to confirm the thrombi resolution documented by echocardiogram, in our institution CMR facility together with an internal protocol in the case of a newer therapeutic strategy led us to perform this modality of cardiac imaging for speculative purpose. The dual therapy with clopidogrel plus rivaroxaban was confirmed [14].At 1 year, a clinical follow-up confirmed the good clinical results: the patient was asymptomatic, and neither ischemic coronary events nor thromboembolic or bleeding events were reported. After 1 year, considering the CHA2DS2-VASc score, the high rate of recurrence of events after NSTEMI, the use of DES, the absence of bleeding events during previously dual antiplatelet therapy, a treatment with rivaroxaban plus aspirin was confirmed.The optimal antithrombotic strategy for patients with NVAF and ACS undergoing PCI is still controversial, and the role of NOACs in this setting is poorly documented [10–14].The guidelines of ACS and AF report how to manage the antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies in overlapped situations, but, frequently, the indication and level of evidence are strong only when the conditions are considered alone [19, 20]. Many different combinations have been proposed based on the use of different agents and for varying duration, but as the final target must balance the risk of bleeding and ischemic events in each patient, it is difficult to make a definitive decision especially when other potential thromboembolic complications (e.g., LV thrombi) occur. NOACs are at least as effective as warfarin in terms of thromboembolic complications, but safer in terms of bleeding complications [8, 9]. As for the dose, in the dual or triple therapy, guidelines recommend the lower available dose of NOACs [19, 20]. Based on the recent results of the PIONEER AF-PCI trial [14], the more effective and safer ratio is clopidogrel 75 mg plus rivaroxaban 15 mg, or either clopidogrel or ticagrelor plus dabigatran at 110 mg or 150 mg (RE-DUAL PCI) [21]. In contrast with the currently available data in which the evidence of the efficacy and safety of NOACs in patients with ACS and AF undergoing PCI is limited to a low HAS-BLED score, our patient had a high bleeding risk; therefore, despite this acute setting, a triple therapy was used for 4 weeks only, followed by dual therapy with clopidogrel plus rivaroxaban 15 mg/die for 12 months [14].The use of aspirin has been reconsidered in the subgroup of patients at high risk of bleeding: for 6 months only in case of low bleeding risk, while for one month in case of high bleeding risk [19, 20]. However, given the results of PIONEER and RE-Dual PCI, it is likely that aspirin will be definitively abandoned.Periprocedural and technical cautions are crucial to minimize either the risk of access site bleeding or the risk of stent thrombosis and recurrence of coronary events. The transradial approach is mandatory also because it shortens the time to restart oral anticoagulation. In our case, the use of the latest-generation fluoro-passivated everolimus-eluting stent, as recently documented [22], lowers the rate of stent thrombosis and thrombotic complications. Intracoronary imaging with an IVUS-guided stent implantation reduces vessel wall malapposition and, consequently, stent thrombosis, thus improving a tailored pharmacological management.Our combined interventional and pharmacological strategy aimed at balancing the ischemic and bleeding risk was also based on the use of the lower dose of NOAC tested for stroke prevention, and clopidogrel instead of the more potent ticagrelor and prasugrel, as suggested by guidelines and expert consensus [19, 20].Although coronary DES significantly reduced the recurrences during the follow-up, the likelihood of a new event is not negligible. In this context, the use of NOACS seems to be a safe and effective option when the patient complexity and frailty due to higher combined thromboembolic and bleeding risk require to achieve multiple therapeutic targets.Bayer HealthCare was not involved in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data.

Giant Right Atrial Aneurysm Accompanying Intrahepatic Cholestasis
1Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Gaziantep University Medical Faculty, Gaziantep, Turkey2Department of Radiology, Gaziantep University Medical Faculty, Gaziantep, Turkey3Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Kecioren Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, TurkeyCorrespondence should be addressed to Ayse Sulu; moc.tenym@ulus_esyaReceived 10 July 2017; Revised 18 October 2017; Accepted 23 October 2017; Published 28 February 2018Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2018 Ayse Sulu et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Right atrial aneurysms were first described in 1955, and subsequently, only a few cases have been reported. The etiology of this condition is unknown. Its comorbidity with cholestasis has not previously been reported in the literature. An 11-month-old baby female, who was an offspring from a first-cousin marriage, was referred to our hospital for investigation of jaundice. She underwent echocardiography because of a heart murmur, and this revealed a giant right atrial aneurysm. In addition, her liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) type 3. Although both conditions are rare, we found their comorbidity interesting and are thus reporting the case.Giant right atrial aneurysms were first described in 1955 by Bailey [1], and very few cases have subsequently been reported. Previous case reports range from those of in utero diagnosis in fetuses to diagnosis in adults. While the etiology is unknown, intrinsic structural protein defects and abnormal collagen structure are thought to be the causative factors [2]. Histopathologic reports define collagen plaques, smooth muscle cells, and atrial myocytes with intervals. Half of the patients with this condition are asymptomatic. The remainder, who are symptomatic, may experience atrial arrhythmias, palpitations, shortness of breath, or chest pain. The diagnosis is based on echocardiography and may be confirmed with noninvasive imaging techniques such as 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cardiac catheterization is not always necessary. Some cases were diagnosed following surgery because of Ebstein’s anomaly. The differential diagnosis includes Ebstein’s anomaly. Possible complications of the condition include arrhythmias, thrombosis, and rupture [3, 4].Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis is a rare type of cholestasis. It has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. There are three types of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis: type 1 and type 2 have an early onset starting in the neonatal period, while type 3 has a late onset. The fibrosis in these patients is progressive and eventually develops into liver insufficiency requiring liver transplantation [5].An 11-month-old female child, the offspring of a consanguineous union, was referred to our hospital for investigation of the etiology of her jaundice. There is no family history of liver disease. Physical examination revealed a weight and height below the 3rd percentile and an icteric appearance, with the skin of the entire body covered with excoriated areas due to scratching. Cardiologic examination revealed a 2/6 systolic murmur. Additionally, the liver was palpable 5 cm below the costal margin. Electrocardiography results were normal. The patient, who had signs of right atrial dilatation, underwent echocardiography, which revealed a giant right atrial aneurysm with thin walls, measuring 3.4 × 2.7 cm in size. It was located at the free wall of the right atrium over the tricuspid valve. The large aperture of the aneurysm was connected to the right atrium. It was mildly compressing the right ventricle and tricuspid valve (Figure 1). 3-dimensional CT angiography confirmed the giant aneurysm connected to the right atrium, measuring 4.2 × 2.3 cm in size (Figures 2 and 3). Meanwhile, results of blood analysis for the jaundice were as follows: total bilirubin, 17.1 mg/dl; direct bilirubin, 13.9 mg/dl; alanine aminotransferase, 120 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 82 IU/L; and gamma glutamyl transferase, 20 IU/L. Abdominal ultrasonography yielded normal results except for hepatomegaly. Magnetic resonance cholangiography findings were also normal. There were no butterfly vertebrae on chest radiographs or facial features suggestive of Alagille syndrome. Results of vision and hearing examinations with brainstem-auditory evoked responses were also unremarkable. Tests showed normal renal function and normal blood sugar. Histological examination of liver biopsy specimens suggested progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3. The patient was started on ursodeoxycholic acid and kept under close observation.Both giant right atrial aneurysm and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis are rare entities. Their comorbidity has not been reported before in the literature. While the etiology of right atrial aneurysm is unclear, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis is a disease inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern [2, 5]. The coexistence of both conditions in our patient is interesting. While patients with giant right atrial aneurysms may be asymptomatic, they may also die from early complications of the disease or may be misdiagnosed with other diseases included in the differential diagnosis [3, 4]. Patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis or right atrial aneurysms should be investigated for signs of other diseases that are asymptomatic or have not developed clinical signs.Learning Objectives. Both giant right atrial aneurysm and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis are rare entities. Their comorbidity has not previously been reported in the literature, and we are therefore reporting the case.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

Diagnosis in case of an isolated pericardial effusion as presentation is challenging, and determining that an angiosarcoma is even more challenging. Here, we presented a rare case of pericardial angiosarcoma which presented to us with tamponade. The patient eventually was diagnosed through pericardiectomy. A multimodality approach was attempted to treat the cancer. The clinical details of such a unique disease entity inspired us to present it as a case report.Pericardial angiosarcoma is a rare form of primary malignancy of the heart. Due to its insidious nature, most cases present with advanced disease with poor outcome. Diagnosis is challenging, demanding a panel of experts. There is no guideline for treatment. Hereby, we present a unique case of tamponade caused by primary angiosarcoma.On May 2016, a 59-year-old Bulgarian male referred from the office of cardiologist to our hospital complaining of worsening shortness of breath, weight gain of 6 pounds, leg swelling, and low blood pressures (BP) down to 80/60 mmHg for a few weeks. Medical history was significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, polycystic kidney disease, and a recent tamponade diagnosed 4 months prior to this hospitalization. Dizziness was his initial complaint in March. A large serosanguinous pericardial effusion was drained at that time with inconclusive fluid analysis including a negative culture and cytology. His medications included amlodipine, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. He used to work as a truck driver. After 45 packs per year smoking history, he quit in 2015. Positive findings on exam were a BP of 85/60 mmHg, mild respiratory distress on room air, increased jugular vein pressure, muffled irregular heart sounds, and pitting edema of the shins. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 59% and a moderate sized posterior pericardial effusion with borderline signs of tamponade. The echo also revealed a fibrinous material and stranding suggestive of adhesions in the collection (Figure 1). Attempt to drain the pericardial effusion with subxiphoid pericardial window was terminated due to fusion of pericardium to the anterior surface of right ventricle. Partial pericardiectomy was then attempted through median sternotomy with frozen section, which revealed a neoplastic process. Hence, a subtotal pericardiectomy was performed. There were adhesions of the pericardium to the right ventricular wall and diaphragmatic surface and nodularity on pericardium. Repeat echocardiogram showed no further effusion. Pericardium and epicardium tissue slides revealed predominantly solid sheets of high-grade epithelioid to spindle cells with focal areas of vasoformation. Tumor cells predominantly epithelioid show prominent atypia with abundant amophilic to eosinophilic cytoplasm, large vesicular nucleoli, and prominent nucleoli with atypical mitotic figures. On immunostaining, tumor cells were positive for CD31, CD34, WT1, vimentin, keratins AE1/AE3, and focal CK7 and negative for CK20, PSA, PSAP, AFP, TTF1, CDX2, BerEp4, calretinin, podoplanin D2, CD45, and S100 (Figures 2(a)–2(d)). These findings led to the diagnosis of epithelioid angiosarcoma of the pericardium. Chest computed tomography scan showed nodular opacifications within both lungs with concern for metastasis. His condition stabilized with Lasix and oxygen. He was then referred to the university hospital for a second opinion regarding his management. Cardiac MRI showed extensive vascular malignant mass in the pericardium encircling and infiltrating the right heart chambers. He received paclitaxel weekly for 6 doses with palliative intents. Later he developed malignant pleural effusions and intracranial metastatic lesions. He was admitted again in our hospital for weakness and encephalopathy. Patient preferred comfort care. Hence, he passed away 9 months after his initial presentation.Primary pericardial neoplasms are rare entities with estimated prevalence of 0.001 to 0.007% based on mostly case series studies [1, 2]. Mesothelioma is the most common malignancy followed by different subtypes of sarcomas and lymphoma [1]. Angiosarcomas account for a third of sarcomas of the heart, and the majority arise in the right atrium. It can be seen at almost any age with peak incidence in middle-aged men. The majority are asymptomatic until they become large enough to cause symptoms. Presentation depends on area of involvement, such as emboli or obstruction in case of intracardiac lesion, arrhythmia with myocardial involvement, and pericardial effusion from pericardial raised tumor. Pericardial angiosarcoma may arise from the epicardial surface of the heart and penetrate the pericardial space. Signs of right-sided heart failure and pericardial effusion are common, which can lead to tamponade. In one study, pericardial effusion was common, but pericardial fluid cytology was negative in all patients who underwent pericardiocentesis [3]. By the time of diagnosis, most patients have metastases, most commonly to the lung [4]. Histologically, angiosarcomas consist of endothelial cells, spindle cells lining, and not well-defined anastomotic vascular spaces, causing sheet-like pericardial thickening. Malignant cells are positive for CD31, CD34, and factor VIII and form vascular channels confirming endothelial differentiation [5]. About 90% of patients die within the first year of diagnosis without resection [6]. Patients who receive multimodality treatment options (combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) have improved survival compared to patients treated with only one modality. Even with all these strategies, longest survival remained less than 3 years [7]. Cardiac transplantation is not currently recommended due to poor survival benefit in few studies [8], except for very selected group of patients with subsequent immunotherapy [9]. Genome sequencing of the tumor in attempt to target gene therapy against vascular-specific receptor tyrosine kinases is currently being studied [2]. The optimal treatment strategy remains to be discovered. The diagnosis of heart angiosarcoma in our patient was challenging due to absence of a mass in different imaging of the heart, resulting in diagnostic pericardiectomy as only definite modality. Still, possibility of malignant tumor should be always considered in cases of recurrent serosanguinous pericardial effusions specially with a negative fluid cytology.Primary malignancies of the heart are so rare that most of the available data come from case reports or large single-center-based studies, with the overall incidence of 0.02% in the United States. Diagnosis in case of an isolated pericardial effusion as presentation is challenging. Unique pathologic features include endothelial cells, spindle cells lining, and vascular spaces. Despite surgical approaches and different chemotherapeutic regimens, prognosis is poor with mean survival of up to 3 years. Different modalities such as heart transplantation, immunotherapy, and targeted gene therapy are recently being studied.This case has been presented as an abstract at the Society of General Internal Medicine Annual Meeting in 2017.The authors above declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Optical Coherence Tomographic Study of a Chronically Retained Coronary Guidewire

This is a case of an urgent percutaneous coronary angioplasty in which a guidewire became entrapped behind a bare metal stent with subsequent fracture of the core filament, which could not be retrieved. Using optical coherence tomography, our case demonstrates extensive tissue coverage of the retained guidewire at twelve months. Five-year follow-up suggests that retained guidewires can be managed without long-term anticoagulation, even when there is substantial intra-aortic material.A 76-year-old patient underwent urgent coronary angiography after presenting to hospital with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarct. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was undertaken to two severe distal stenoses in the left circumflex artery, during which the tip of the coronary guidewire (Hi-Torque Balanced Middle Weight Universal, Abbott Vascular) became entrapped behind a bare metal stent (2.5 × 12 mm Liberte, Boston Scientific). Efforts to free the tip with countertraction resulted in fracture of the guidewire core filament, which could not be retrieved. Fluoroscopy showed that the filament extended from the distal circumflex through the left main stem into the ascending aorta (Figure 1). Surgical retrieval was deemed too hazardous, and the patient was discharged on aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin (for 1 year).Twelve months later, angina recurred. Coronary angiography demonstrated severe diffuse restenosis within the stented segment, which was treated by balloon dilatation (Scoreflex, OrbusNeich) and a drug-coated balloon (SeQuent Please, B. Braun). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) (St. Jude, Light Lab) was then undertaken from the distal vessel back to the ostium of the left circumflex artery. This demonstrated that the retained guidewire filament was covered by neointimal hyperplasia over approximately 50% of its length (Figure 2), with evidence of tissue bridges (Figure 3). The remainder of the wire remained free within the vessel lumen with no evidence of tissue coverage (Figure 4).Five years after guidewire entrapment, the patient has remained free of thrombotic complications on aspirin and clopidogrel.Guidewire entrapment is a very rare complication of PCI (occurring in 0.08%) [1]. The most common mechanisms for fracture of the coronary guidewire are entrapment, excessive rotation, or forceful traction of the guidewire [2]. The risk of guidewire entrapment and fracture is therefore dependent on two factors: the first is lesion characteristics, and the second is the type of guidewire used. A tortuous, calcified, and distal lesion is more likely to cause fracture due to the risk of overcoiling and bending of the guidewire.Regarding the guidewire type, a polymer-jacketed guidewire (as in this case) has been implicated as a risk factor (occurring in 35% of the reported cases) [3]. The site of fracture is most likely to occur at the junction point between the 3 cm flexible tip and the remainder of the guidewire [4]. The retention of a long filament, as in this case, is therefore unusual.The need for surgical removal and the urgency of this depend on individual circumstances, in particular the immediate ischaemic/haemodynamic complications [5]. Some authors suggest that the entrapped material need not be surgically removed if it is in the distal coronary bed, but it is necessary if there is protrusion into the ascending aorta [5]. Surgical removal can be difficult and may lead to further vessel damage [6]. This OCT study provides a unique insight into the medium-term vascular response to guidewire entrapment. We found that a substantial proportion of the intracoronary wire was covered by tissue, particularly where it was adjacent to the vessel wall. In addition, tissue bridges were seen to extend from the wall into the lumen along the wire. The cellular components of the tissue are unknown, but probably resemble neointimal hyperplasia. We do not know whether this process has continued in the longer term, nor whether it has also occurred in the aortic portion of the wire. Tissue coverage of the metal filament is likely to have minimised the risk of thrombotic complications.This case has two main implications: firstly, guidewire entrapment can be managed conservatively with good long-term outcomes, even when there is a material within the ascending aorta. Secondly, long-term anticoagulation is not required, and dual antiplatelet therapy appears to be sufficient.The authors report no financial relationships or conflicts of interest regarding the content herein.
Mediastinal Hematoma and Tracheal Compression following Transradial Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

We report an unusual case of stridor after PCI due to brachiocephalic artery perforation, pseudoaneurysm formation, and development of a large mediastinal hematoma with tracheal compression. Endovascular repair of the brachiocephalic artery was achieved with covered stent placement at the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. This case highlights the importance of careful guide catheter placement from the right radial approach. Ultimately, rapid diagnosis of vascular perforation, appropriate airway management, and prompt endovascular repair of the injured vessel is critical to the successful management of this life-threatening condition.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) via the radial artery is an effective approach to treat patients with coronary artery disease. In large randomized trials of transradial versus transfemoral arterial access, patients who underwent transradial catheterization had fewer major adverse cardiovascular events, fewer access site bleeding events, and lower mortality than those who underwent transfemoral coronary intervention [1–3]. Thus, transradial access has been hailed as the preferred approach to minimize vascular complications associated with cardiac catheterization. Major vascular complications of transradial arterial access, although rare, occur in approximately 0.2% of coronary procedures [4, 5]. Vascular perforation, one of the most severe complications of radial PCI, can occur following aggressive manipulation of guidewires or catheters as they are advanced through the radial, brachial, subclavian, and brachiocephalic arteries. Complications typically occur when wires or catheters shear the arterial wall in looped, tortuous, or small caliber arterial segments. In this report, we present an unusual case of stridor after PCI due to brachiocephalic artery perforation, pseudoaneurysm formation, and development of a large mediastinal hematoma with tracheal compression.A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with lifestyle-limiting angina. He underwent diagnostic coronary angiography that revealed stenoses of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, ramus intermedius coronary artery, and the distal right coronary artery (RCA). Coronary artery bypass grafting was recommended, but the patient refused surgery and elected for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) instead. Initially, transradial PCI of the LAD and ramus coronary arteries was performed with placement of drug-eluting stents in each vessel. The patient was discharged on aspirin and ticagrelor with a plan for staged coronary intervention of the distal RCA at a later date.Three months after the initial coronary intervention, the patient returned for planned PCI of the distal RCA stenosis. Access was again obtained in the right radial artery with a short 6 French slender sheath. After routine diagnostic coronary angiography confirmed a severe stenosis in the distal RCA (Figure 1(a)), bivalirudin was administered. A 6 French AL 0.75 guide catheter (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was advanced over an exchange length 0.035″ J-wire, but could not be delivered to the ascending aorta due to resistance in the brachiocephalic artery. The guide was removed and exchanged for a 6 French JR 4 guide catheter (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), which was easily advanced into the ascending aorta and used to engage the ostium of the RCA without complication. Next, a standard 0.014″ RunThrough coronary guidewire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was placed in the distal RCA, and percutaneous coronary intervention was performed. The lesion was predilated with a 2.0 mm Maverick compliant balloon (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) inflated to 10 ATM, and a Xience Alpine 2.75 × 12 mm cobalt chromium everolimus drug-eluting stent (Abbot Vascular, Abbott Park, IL, USA) was delivered to the lesion and deployed at 16 ATM. There was a good angiographic result of the distal RCA with no residual stenosis (Figure 1(b)). Immediately following completion of the procedure, the patient reported an episode of chest discomfort, a new cough, bilateral expiratory wheezes, and respiratory stridor. A transient episode of hypotension was noted but resolved without intervention. The patient was rapidly administered IV methylprednisolone, famotidine, diphenhydramine, and inhaled racemic epinephrine for presumed allergic reaction to iodinated contrast. Although his symptoms largely improved, stridor persisted. Urgent otolaryngology consultation was obtained for the evaluation of possible laryngeal edema, but flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy was unremarkable. Next, chest radiography was promptly obtained, which revealed a markedly widened superior mediastinum (Figure 2).Based on the findings on chest radiography, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was urgently performed. Echocardiography revealed no evidence of aortic dissection, but vague echodensities were noted anterior to the right heart suggestive of a hematoma. Thus, computed tomography (CT) of the chest without intravenous contrast was performed to obtain cross-sectional imaging of the mediastinum. The chest CT revealed a large hyperdense region surrounding the trachea suggestive of an anterior mediastinal hematoma, resulting in severe airway compression (Figure 3(a)). Due to the severity of tracheal compression, the decision was made to perform endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and transfer to the intensive care unit. After intubation, a repeat CT of the chest with administration of intravenous contrast was notable for a small pseudoaneurysm arising from the inferior aspect of the brachiocephalic artery, as well as significant narrowing of the distal trachea below the endotracheal tube (Figure 3(b)).After consultation with cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, the decision was made to pursue endovascular repair of the brachiocephalic artery pseudoaneurysm and presumed site of vascular perforation. Access was obtained in the left common femoral artery, and angiography of the brachiocephalic artery was performed, which confirmed the presence of a brachiocephalic artery pseudoaneurysm (Figure 4(a)). Next, a SupraCore wire (Abbot Vascular, Abbott Park, IL, USA) was placed in the right subclavian artery and a 10 × 40 mm iCAST covered stent (Atrium Medical, Hudson, NH, USA) was deployed across the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. The covered stent was postdilated with a 12 × 20 mm Armada balloon (Abbot Vascular, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Following the intervention, there was an excellent angiographic result with preserved subclavian and carotid runoff (Figure 4(b)). Aspirin was continued; P2Y12 inhibitors were temporarily withheld.Due to persistent tracheal compression after endovascular repair of the brachiocephalic artery, a Tracheobronxane Dumon silicone tracheal stent (Novatech, La Ciotat, France) was inserted by interventional pulmonology to maintain airway patency while the mediastinal hematoma resorbed. Over the ensuring days, serial imaging demonstrated no further enlargement of the mediastinal hematoma, and dual antiplatelet agents were resumed. The tracheal stent was retrieved and removed after 12 days. The patient was ultimately discharged to inpatient rehabilitation on hospital day 19.Vascular perforation associated with delivery of a 6 French guide catheter in the subclavian and brachiocephalic arteries is rare, with few cases reported in the literature [6–8]. In this case, brachiocephalic artery perforation resulted in pseudoaneurysm formation and a large mediastinal hematoma with tracheal compression and stridor. This highlights the importance of careful guide catheter placement from the right radial approach. When guide catheters are advanced through tortuous subclavian and brachiocephalic arteries, the application of forward pressure against resistance can lead to vascular complications, even when a guidewire is appropriately positioned in the ascending aorta. If resistance is encountered, fluoroscopy should be used to confirm the relative positions of the distal guidewire and guide catheter, and care should be taken to ensure appropriate guidewire position before advancing the guide further. Abduction of the arm and deep inspiration may also facilitate advancement of guide catheters to the ascending aorta. When the guide catheter cannot be easily advanced, balloon-assisted tracking (or similar techniques employing a low-profile 0.035″ compatible support catheter protruding through the lumen of a standard 6 Fr guiding catheter) can smooth the transition at the distal tip of the guide catheter. This can prevent vessel shearing from the “razor effect” at the distal tip of the guide catheter and minimize vascular trauma. Hydrophilic guiding catheters may also be used to pass tortuous subclavian or brachiocephalic anatomy. Rigid guide catheters, larger French sizes, and those with a more tortuous or curved shape at the distal tip may be most likely to cause trauma during catheter delivery. In the present case, the Amplatz shape of the initial guiding catheter may have played a role in the resulting perforation.This report also illustrates the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis when respiratory distress occurs after PCI. In this case, an allergic reaction to iodinated contrast was initially suspected when stridor and wheezing developed after completion of the procedure. Reactions to contrast media affect approximately 1 in every 500 patients undergoing coronary angiography in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, and the clinical presentation can range from urticaria to laryngeal edema and bronchospasm to cardiovascular shock and respiratory arrest [9]. The likelihood of an anaphylactoid reaction to contrast media is not necessarily related to contrast media dose, nor is it always an immediate response to contrast media exposure. When angioedema is suspected, patients require prompt airway evaluation and may require tracheal intubation to maintain airway patency. In this case, flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy was urgently performed to exclude this dangerous diagnosis. Once it was evident that laryngeal edema was absent and anaphylactoid reaction to contrast media was unlikely, alternate diagnoses were considered. Ultimately, this rare vascular complication of PCI was only identified after a series of diagnostic imaging studies, including chest radiography, transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, and finally, invasive angiography. Therefore, all providers in the cardiac catheterization laboratory should be aware of procedural risks specific to the transradial approach.In conclusion, vascular perforations due to guide catheter advancement from the right radial artery are rare. In this case, a 6 French AL 0.75 guide catheter led to brachiocephalic artery perforation, pseudoaneurysm formation, and a large mediastinal hematoma with tracheal compression. Prompt recognition, appropriate airway management, and endovascular repair of the injured vessel is critical to the successful management of this potentially life-threatening condition.Dr. Muhamed Saric serves on a speaker bureau for Philips and Medtronic and an advisory board for Siemens.

Acute Pericarditis Occurring Three Days after Intravesical Instillation of Mitomycin C after Transurethral Bladder Tumor Resection in a 64-Year-Old Woman
1Department of Internal Medicine, Maimonides Medical Center, 4802 10th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219, USA2Department of Cardiology, Maimonides Medical Center, 4802 10th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Vineet Meghrajani; moc.liamg@inajarhgemteenivReceived 30 August 2017; Revised 16 January 2018; Accepted 29 January 2018; Published 21 February 2018Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2018 Vineet Meghrajani et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We present a 64-year-old woman who developed symptoms of acute pericarditis three days after undergoing intravesical instillation of mitomycin C following transurethral bladder tumor resection. Mitomycin C is a chemotherapeutic agent which acts by alkylation of DNA and is known to be cardiotoxic when systemically administered. Despite classic pericarditis symptoms, the patient underwent an urgent coronary angiogram due to elevated cardiac troponin I level, EKG changes, and wall motion abnormalities on her echocardiogram. During her angiogram, it was found that she had multiple stenotic coronary artery lesions, with no acute total coronary occlusions, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was done with placement of a single drug-eluting stent for a 95% stenotic lesion in the left anterior descending artery. The patient was discharged after an uneventful hospitalization on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and prasugrel, and colchicine for pericarditis. It is likely that the patient’s presentation was the result of a perimyocardial inflammatory process secondary to intravesically administered mitomycin C, rather than an acute coronary syndrome. While the pathophysiological basis of cardiotoxicity of systemically administered mitomycin C is well documented, more studies are needed to determine whether intravesical MMC may cause cardiotoxicity.Acute pericarditis refers to inflammation of the pericardial sac—a tough double-layered fibroserous sac which covers the heart. Pericarditis has multiple causes, including infections, autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorders, neoplasms, trauma, radiation, and drugs [1–3], and its clinical manifestations typically include sharp and pleuritic chest pain that is improved by sitting up and leaning forward, a pericardial friction rub, EKG changes of new widespread ST elevations and PR depressions, and pericardial effusion [4]. Pericarditis is frequently self-limiting, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents remain the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cases [5]. We have here presented the case of a 64-year-old woman who developed acute pericarditis three days after intravesical instillation of mitomycin C chemotherapy after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT).A 64-year-old postmenopausal woman presented to the emergency department at 10 am in the morning with chest pain and shortness of breath of approximately 12 hours duration. Her medical history included right breast invasive ductal carcinoma with bilateral mastectomies in 2015, recently diagnosed bladder cancer with TURBT and intravesical mitomycin C instillation three days prior to current presentation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and prothrombin G20210A mutation. She had quit smoking 5 years ago, prior to that she had smoked 2 packs per day for 45 years. She was asymptomatic until about 10 pm the night before presentation, when she developed shortness of breath and sharp pleuritic chest pain while she was lying in bed. The patient reported that her chest pain was located in the substernal region, radiating to the back, aggravated by deep breaths and by lying down, and alleviated by sitting up and leaning forward. She said that she had taken some ibuprofen which had reduced the intensity of pain. She did endorse that she was also experiencing a less prominent pressure like sensation in addition to the sharp pleuritic type of pain. She denied fevers, chills, cough, diaphoresis, palpitations, dizziness, abdominal pain, heartburn, nausea or vomiting, flu-like symptoms, recent illnesses, or any history of chest pain in the past. Her family history was significant for her brother having an episode of myocardial infarction at age 55.On detailed inquiry of the patient’s history of bladder cancer, the patient reported that she was diagnosed in 2012 after undergoing cystoscopy for an episode of gross hematuria and was found to have a low-grade bladder cancer. She underwent transurethral bladder tumor resection and 1 cycle of intravesical BCG treatment in 2012 and was asymptomatic after that with regular follow-up with urology. On a surveillance cystoscopy performed by the patient’s urologist in December 2016, a lesion was seen in the bladder, for which a biopsy was subsequently done which showed papillary hyperplasia and inflammation with no cancer. For this recurrence, the patient was planned for a cystoscopic transurethral bladder tumor resection and instillation of 40 mg of mitomycin C in the bladder, which she underwent three days before her current hospital presentation. The patient was intubated during this procedure which was uneventful, and was subsequently extubated without difficulty.The patient’s oral temperature on presentation was 98.0 F, heart rate of 107/min, respiratory rate of 25/min, and blood pressure of 152/63 mmHg (right arm, supine position). On examination, the patient was in no acute distress and appeared comfortable, although was complaining of having mild chest pain, alleviated by leaning forward. Her laboratory data were as follows: cardiac troponins on the day of presentation, 0.57 ng/ml at 12:30 pm; D-dimer, 257 ng/ml; and white blood cell count, 12.2 K/ml with 67.3% neutrophils. 12-lead electrocardiogram (Figure 1) showed diffuse concave ST elevations with PR depressions in all leads, except in aVR which showed ST depression and PR elevation.The patient was treated with aspirin 325 mg orally and nebulized albuterol. An echocardiogram was performed which showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 61–65%, mid and apical inferior wall motion abnormality, mild to moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and trivial pericardial effusion. Although the patient’s clinical presentation and electrocardiogram findings were consistent with pericarditis, an urgent coronary angiogram was planned due to the possibility of the patient having an acute coronary syndrome, considering her continuing chest pain, elevated cardiac troponin level, echocardiogram findings of mid and apical inferior wall motion abnormality, and the presence of multiple risk factors of ischemic heart disease. The coronary angiogram, performed through right radial artery access, showed a normal left main stem artery, proximal left anterior descending luminal irregularities, a 95% stenotic focal lesion of the mid left anterior descending artery, 40% stenosis of distal left circumflex artery, 30% stenosis of the ostial right coronary artery, 40% stenosis of proximal right coronary artery, 50% stenosis of mid right coronary artery, and 99% stenosis of right posterior descending artery. Left ventricular diastolic pressure was recorded to be 24 mmHg. A single 2.5 × 20 mm synergy monorail drug-eluting stent was placed in the stenosed segment of the mid left anterior descending artery. The patient received 60 mg of prasugrel orally during the procedure, a bolus dose of intravenous tirofiban followed by a maintenance dose intravenous tirofiban drip, and was admitted to the telemetry floor. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81 mg daily and prasugrel 10 mg daily was initiated, and the patient was also started on colchicine 0.6 mg every 12 hours for pericarditis. The remainder of the hospitalization was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the third hospital day, with a plan for a staged percutaneous coronary intervention for the 99% stenotic lesion in the right posterior descending artery in a few weeks.The term “perimyocarditis” is used for cases of acute pericarditis that also demonstrate myocardial inflammation—it may be associated with increases in serum biomarkers of myocardial injury such as cardiac troponin I or T [6] and echocardiographic findings of diffuse/localized LV wall motion abnormalities [7, 8]. In clinical practice, it may be difficult to differentiate between perimyocarditis and ST elevation myocardial infarction due to EKG findings of ST elevation and cardiac biomarker elevation seen in both conditions [9, 10].The patient’s clinical presentation and EKG were strongly suggestive of pericarditis. Her chest pain was pleuritic and positional, with relief in a seated position and with ibuprofen—pointing more towards pericarditis than myocardial ischemia [1, 2]. The initial EKG obtained on presentation showed diffuse concave ST elevations with PR depressions in all leads, except in aVR which showed ST depression and PR elevation—a finding that is consistent with pericarditis [1, 2, 4]. Also, the distribution of the ST elevations on the EKG was more diffuse than what would be expected from her distal coronary lesions.Due to her multiple risk factors—smoking, obesity, family history of early coronary artery disease, and a mildly elevated initial cardiac troponin I level of 0.57 ng/ml, an urgent echocardiogram was performed which showed wall motion abnormalities in the mid and apical inferior wall and trivial pericardial effusion. Coronary angiography performed subsequently showed a 95% focal stenotic lesion in the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) and 99% lesion in the right posterior descending artery, with no acute total coronary occlusions. Since the patient had continued to complain of chest pain through her presentation—which may have been worsened due the tachycardia caused by pericardial pain combined with the stenotic lesion in the LAD resulting in a possible ischemic component to the pain (similar to an exercise stress test)—and considering the apical wall motion abnormality seen on the echocardiogram, a decision was made to proceed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of a drug-eluting stent for the LAD stenosis. However, based on the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease leading to acute coronary syndromes, the underlying pathology in most cases of acute myocardial infarction is an acute intraluminal coronary thrombus formation within an epicardial coronary artery leading to total or near-total acute coronary occlusion, something which our patient did not have [11]. A repeat troponin I level which resulted after angiography was 0.54 ng/ml at 5:30 pm (a downtrend from the earlier level of 0.57 ng/ml at 12:30 pm). Given her 12 hours of continuous chest pain, this is a particularly low troponin I level if acute coronary syndrome was her primary issue [12].An EKG obtained 15 hours after intervention (Figure 2) showed neither the resolution of the ST elevation nor the evolution of pathological Q waves, either of which should have occurred if ischemia was the reason for her EKG findings [13]. A follow-up EKG performed 3 weeks after hospital discharge (Figure 3) shows complete resolution of the EKG findings and was essentially unchanged when compared to her EKG performed 1 week prior to the TURBT (Figure 4). This is consistent with resolution of her pericarditis.Mitomycin C is the most commonly used intravesical chemotherapeutic agent [14] and has an established role in intravesical administration following resection of low-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer [15]. It exerts its biological effects by alkylation of cellular nucleophiles, including DNA, after undergoing enzymatic bioreduction into a bis-electrophilic intermediate [16]. A study was done to determine the systemic absorption of intravesical mitomycin C (MMC) in which fourteen patients with primary or recurrent non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) underwent single early intravesical instillation of MMC (40 mg in 50 mL distilled water) immediately after TURBT. The results showed that maximal MMC plasma concentrations were reached 40 minutes after instillation with a highest plasma peak of 49.25 ng/ml. In the first samples, at 20 minutes after instillation, the plasma concentration of MMC was significantly correlated with the extent of TURBT () [17].Side effects following intravesical administration of mitomycin C include myelosuppression [18], a self-limited chemical cystitis that rarely progresses to the shrunken contracted bladder [19], and a rash primarily involving the palms, soles, and genitalia, which is thought to be a manifestation of a hypersensitivity reaction [20]. While systemically administered mitomycin C has been known to be associated with dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, especially when combined with or given following doxorubicin [21], the association of cardiotoxicity with intravesically administered mitomycin C has not been studied. A study was done in 2013 which analyzed data retrospectively from 3 academic tertiary referral centers between 2000 and 2010, in which 47 patients (median age 70, range 32–85; 36 males and 11 females) who previously failed a median of 2 intravesical treatments, subsequently received 6 weekly treatments with sequential intravesical gemcitabine (1 g) and mitomycin C (40 mg) chemotherapy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Among the patients who developed complications as a result of the study, 1 patient was reported to have developed pericarditis shortly after the last treatment that was attributed to mitomycin C exposure [22].The possibility of cardiotoxicity in the form of perimyocarditis occurring in association with intravesical mitomycin C instillation following TURBT has not been studied and with no documented case reports in existing literature and only one instance of pericarditis attributed to intravesical MMC instillation in a retrospective analysis [16]. While the pathophysiological basis of cardiotoxicity of systemically administered mitomycin C is well documented [14], more studies are needed to determine whether intravesical MMC may cause cardiotoxicity.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

This report describes an 8-year-old female who had cardiac murmur but with no clinical symptoms. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal, but echocardiography made the diagnosis of ALCAPA. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with cardiac catheterization angiography (CAG) confirmed the diagnosis, and finally, the patient received surgery. This case demonstrates that echocardiography is a sensitive and convenient technique for establishing the initial diagnosis of ALCAPA in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.ALCAPA is a rare congenital cardiovascular malformation in which the left coronary artery originates from the pulmonary artery (PA) instead of the left coronary sinus [1]. The incidence is 1 in 300,000 live births and accounts for 0.25% to 0.5% of congenital heart disease cases. ALCAPA results in mortality as high as 90% in the first year of life if the patient is not treated in a timely fashion [2]. Here, we present a case of a female patient diagnosed with ALCAPA. The patient’s medical records, such as clinical symptoms, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization angiography (CAG) images, were analyzed retrospectively.An 8-year-old Chinese female with a cardiac murmur was initially diagnosed as having a ventricular septal defect (VSD) in the local hospital. She was asymptomatic, had no difficulty breathing, and displayed neither increased diaphoresis nor cyanosis, but she developed upper respiratory infections more often than her peers and had reduced exercise capacity compared to her peers. On physical examination, she had the following vital measurements: 24 kg weight, 121 cm height, blood pressure 115/51 mm·Hg, heart rate 92/min, respiratory rate of 22/min, and transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) 96%. The results of physical examination were normal when compared with the same age of females within same race. On cardiac examination, her pulse and S1 and S2 were normal, but she had a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the second left intercostal space.ECG displayed normal sinus rhythm and no signs of myocardial ischemia. Chest X-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography demonstrated ALCAPA, right coronary artery to right ventriclar fistula, right coronary artery aneurysm, collateral coronary circulation formation, severe mitral regurgitation (MR), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 61%, and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) of 33% (Figure 1).Subsequently, cardiac catheterization and left ventricular angiography demonstrated a dilated right coronary artery (RCA) and with delayed filling of a dilated left coronary artery (LCA). There was no shunt across the interventricular septum. Then, aortic root angiography showed the dilated RCA originating from the right coronary cusp (RCC), and delayed enhanced-imaging demonstrated the LCA filling via extensive intercoronary collateral circulation. Finally, PA angiography showed immediate filling of the LCA, which originated from the PA; then abundant collateral circulation and delayed RCA were imaged (Figure 2), confirming the diagnosis of ALCAPA.The patient underwent direct reimplantation of the abnormal LCA into the aorta with general anesthesia under extracorporeal circulation through a median sternotomy. During the procedure, origin of the LCA from the PA trunk, a dilated and tortuous RCA from the RCC, extensive intercoronary collaterals, and anterior mitral valve prolapse were confirmed (Figure 3). Postoperative bedside echocardiography showed LCA connected to aorta sinus, bilateral coronary artery aneurysms (Figure 4), and moderate-to-severe MR with LVEF of 71%, LVFS of 39%. The chest was closed on postoperative day 2, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 11 with an uneventful recovery. Postoperative chest X-ray showed inflammation and exudation in the lung and mild cardiomegaly. We followed the patient on the first month (bilateral coronary artery aneurysms and moderate MR with LVEF of 61%, LVFS of 32%), sixth month (right coronary artery aneurysms/dilated left coronary artery and mild-to-moderate MR with LVEF of 65%, LVFS of 35%), and first year (bilateral dilated coronary arteries and mild MR with LVEF of 67%, LVFS of 34%) after the surgery by echocardiography (Figure 5), and the patient showed good functional recovery.ALCAPA is also named Bland–White–Garland syndrome. Clinically, ALCAPA has been divided into adult and infant types according to intercoronary collateral circulation extent. Infant type usually survives only a few months for the reason of myocardial ischemia and heart failure, and only about 10% to 15% of patients survive to adolescence or adulthood [3]. On the other hand, extensive intercoronary collateral circulation usually exists in adult type, forming the “left to right shunt” and “coronary artery steal blood” phenomenon, which could induce to abnormal perfusion of myocardium and sudden death [4]. Our case was defined as the adult type, with relatively abundant collateral circulation and minimal symptoms and a heart murmur.The incidence of adult type of ALCAPA is very low and often be asymptomatic, so it is usually being misdiagnosed, especially when ECG shows no obvious ST-T change and V waves. Echocardiography is usually the initial diagnostic tool; when the echocardiographer found the imaging feature of the dilation and dysfunction of left ventricular with severe mitral regurgitation, abnormal flow-pattern in the ventricular septum and dilatation of the right coronary artery, and the wide enhancement and thickening of the endocardium, the echocardiographer should not only pay attention to idiopathic endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) [5] and/or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) [6] but also should check the origination of the coronary arteries to avoid being misdiagnosed. The typical and direct echocardiographic imaging feature is to show the LCA originating from the pulmonary artery when diagnosing ALCAPA and should also reveal the origin, size, and course of coronary arteries clearly. In addition, the reversal of blood flow in the left coronary artery and abundant collateral circulation are approval to the diagnosis of ALCAPA. Visibly, echocardiography is an indispensable diagnostic tool because of its noninvasive repeatability, low cost, and ability to clearly show the origin of the coronary artery. It can not only determine real-time hemodynamic change, but also can measure heart function in subclinical stage and postoperative follow-up, including the index of heart, resilience, myocardial wall motion, and strain rate [7]. The patient reported in this report was misdiagnosed as having a VSD in the local hospital mainly due to two reasons: first and most importantly, the fistula in the ventricular septum was diagnosed as a VSD; second, the echocardiographer may not have comprehensive knowledge of ALCAPA.However, DSA with CAG is considered as the gold standard diagnosis of ALCAPA. The use of the contrast agent in severe infant patients remains controversial with regard to ionization radiation and potential allergic reaction [8]. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) have been increasingly employed for the diagnosis of ALCAPA. CTA is a noninvasive imaging technique with good density and spatial resolution, which has certain advantages to evaluate small blood vessels such as the coronary artery, but it cannot evaluate an intravascular blood flow condition. MRA can be used to diagnose postoperative left ventricular morphology and function in patients with suspected myocardial ischemia; its image quality can be easily influenced by heart rate.ALCAPA is a rare congenital heart disease that carries a high mortality rate and may lead to sudden death if left untreated. Typical echocardiographic features and comprehension of ALCAPA are helpful for diagnosis and differential diagnosis. The echocardiography can diagnose ALCAPA accurately and give sufficient information for heart function and operation.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.The work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 81301300); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China (no. cstc 2014 jcyjA10011); and Chongqing Science and Technology Commission (cstc2016shmszx 130009).
Aortitis as a Rare Cause of Aortic Aneurysm and Valve Regurgitation: Is Repair Precluded?

Valve-sparing procedures have been proposed, but there is not clear evidence of which is the treatment of choice. We report the case of a 38-year-old pregnant lady with a diagnosis of idiopathic aortitis associated with aortic root aneurysm and severe aortic valve regurgitation.Aortitis is an infrequent cause of aortic root dilatation and aortic valve regurgitation, having been described several infectious and noninfectious etiologies for this yet not well-known entity [1]. The approach to the “valvular problem” is controversial, having been reported increased rates of paravalvular leaks with prosthetic replacement [2]. Valve-sparing procedures have also been proposed [3], but there is not clear evidence of which is the treatment of choice.We report the case of a 38-year-old pregnant lady with a diagnosis of idiopathic aortitis associated with aortic root aneurysm and severe aortic valve regurgitation.The patient had a history of cardiac murmur, having had an echocardiogram performed two years before the episode showing a mild mitral regurgitation with a normal aortic valve and aorta. She was asymptomatic until the 4th month of pregnancy when she began with tachycardia and exertional dyspnea which rapidly evolved to rest dyspnea; she was admitted to the hospital, and an echocardiographic study was performed, showing a very severe aortic regurgitation and a 5.5 cm aneurysm of the root and ascending aorta; the left ventricle was markedly dilated with a borderline ventricular fraction. No computed tomography scan was done to avoid potential damage to the fetus.She was transferred to our unit for urgent surgery for a planned valve-preserving surgery.She was operated on under general anesthesia and median sternotomy. The aortic arch and the right atrium were cannulated in a standard fashion, and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established under normothermia. CPB flows were kept high maintaining a mean arterial pressure above 70 mmHg, and the use of vasoconstrictors was avoided [4, 5].The aorta was clamped and opened showing a marked thickening of its wall. The root was dissected, and the coronary ostial buttons trimmed; the tissues around the root had heavy adherences indicating an inflammatory process. Geometric height of the leaflets was measured with a ruler; it was 15 for the noncoronary leaflet, 14 for the right, and 14 for the left. A valve-sparing remodeling procedure was done using a dacron straight graft of 24 mm. The technique of the remodeling procedure followed the recommendations of the Homburg group [6]. The post procedure intraoperative echocardiogram showed a residual mild regurgitation of the valve, which was considered acceptable. The jet was central, in its origin and direction, and the effective height of the repaired cusps was 8 mm.The fetal status was assessed before surgery and after the completion of the procedure by transabdominal echography, showing an alive fetus.The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. She was discharged on metoprolol and iron. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed before discharge showing a mild regurgitation of the aortic valve with a marked unloading of the left ventricle.She continued her pregnancy, and a healthy girl was born with a vaginal delivery.She was investigated thoroughly, and all known causes of aortitis or genetic disorders were discarded. No other signs or symptoms of the disease were found. She was diagnosed with idiopathic aortitis at that moment. Anyhow, she was started with immunosuppressant treatment with corticoids.She underwent clinical and serial echocardiographic follow-up. The 6-month echo showed a progression of the regurgitation which was moderate at that time, and in the 1-year echo, it became severe. As she continued to be asymptomatic, a narrower follow-up was decided, but 3 months later, the left ventricle had dilated markedly, and redo surgery was indicated.Redo surgery was performed through a resternotomy with central cannulation. The Dacron graft was opened through a transverse incision, the aortic valve was measured and resected, and a 23 mm mechanical prosthesis was inserted in a supra-annular position with pledgeted sutures. The leaflets were markedly retracted at that time, with a geometric height of less than 4 mm. The Dacron graft was then sutured, and the patient was weaned from CPB and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for an uneventful recovery.Two years later, a new-onset supra-aortic vessel narrowing has been detected, and a diagnosis of Takayasu disease has been made.Aortitis is a rare cause of aortic aneurysms and aortic valve regurgitation.Aortitis of the ascending aorta is a rare condition that can result in aneurysm and valve dysfunction. Although valve-preserving surgery has been successfully accomplished by others [3], in our opinion, these patients might probably be best served by valve and root replacement.In our patient, the aorta wall was markedly thickened and the geometric height of the leaflets was low which should have led us to replace the valve instead of performing a valve-preserving surgery as formerly showed by the evolution of the patient. Geometric height is a major prognostic factor in valve repair with heights under 16 mm in tricuspid valves or 19 mm in bicuspid valves considered as restricted, being advisable to replace the valve in those instances [7].The mechanism because of which the valve was regurgitant was not only the dilation of the aorta but also, and probably most importantly, the retraction of the tissue of the leaflets which was responsible for the recurrence of the aortic insufficiency.Considering the pregnancy of the patient, we tried to avoid a prosthetic valve substitute and preserved the valve despite its low geometric height. She could continue her pregnancy until term without any damage to the newborn. Anyway, given the evolution of the case, probably she would have been better served with a biological root replacement.Follow-up of repaired patients is mandatory, with 6-month and yearly echocardiographic assessment highly advisable in our opinion, to discard recurrence of the regurgitation, which happened in our patient, who despite being asymptomatic had progressive dilatation of the left ventricle.Aortic valve repair is probably not the best option for patients with aortitis.Close follow-up of these patients is mandatory.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Left Circumflex Artery Rupture with Left Atrial Tamponade and Functional Mitral Stenosis

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The growth in percutaneous transluminal devices has enabled operators to tackle more complex, native, and post-bypass surgery anatomy. However, complications such as coronary artery dissection, coronary perforation, retrograde aortic dissection, arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndrome still occur with resulting mortality rates of up to 4.2% in complex interventions. Perforation of the circumflex artery is of particular interest in view of its position and relation to the surrounding cardiac structures. This is a site of potential fluid collection, and as the left atrium is fixed to the parietal pericardium at the entry of the pulmonary veins, fluid in the oblique sinus can accumulate enough pressure to compress the left atrium and the coronary sinus. We present a case of left circumflex artery perforation which demonstrates the physiologic complications of coronary sinus and left atrial compression and the resultant functional mitral stenosis.A 70-year-old gentleman was admitted to the emergency room for unstable angina. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 6 years prior to current admission and also had persistent atrial fibrillation on rate control and anticoagulation. His ejection fraction was 65%. Coronary angiogram showed occlusion of all vein grafts but patent left internal mammary graft to left anterior descending artery with severe native multivessel disease. There was severe stenosis of the native left circumflex artery (Figure 1(a)); the proximal right coronary artery was completely occluded, and it was supplied distally by bridging collaterals and collaterals from the left circumflex artery. After extensive discussion with the patient, decision was made for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the native left circumflex artery. Serial balloon dilation to the mid circumflex artery was performed: first with a 2.5 mm × 15 mm balloon but a waist was noted (Figure 1(b)), followed by a noncompliant 2.5 mm × 12 mm balloon but a residual waist was still observed, and finally with a 2.5 mm × 10 mm scoring balloon (AngioSculpt, Spectranetics, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) inflating up to 20 atmospheres (Figure 1(c)). The stenosis gave way, and repeat angiogram noted Ellis Class III perforation (Figure 1(d)).The operators immediately inflated a 3.0 mm balloon to 8 atmospheres at the site of perforation followed by deployment of a 2.5 × 24 mm covered stent. However, repeat angiography still showed extravasation from perforation site and a second 2.5 × 12 mm covered stent was deployed, but there was continued extravasation. Protamine sulfate was given, and prolonged balloon inflation was then performed. Subsequent angiography showed that the circumflex artery was thrombosed.Immediate bedside transthoracic echocardiogram showed very small 4 mm pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis was attempted but was unsuccessful. The ejection fraction was normal, and there were no other echocardiographic features of cardiac tamponade.The patient remained hemodynamically stable for about 20 minutes before developing progressive hypotension. The ECG showed fast atrial fibrillation with acute ST elevation in II, III and aVF (Figure 2). He was supported with inotropes but developed pulseless ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion and 10 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) was inserted for hemodynamic stabilization. Repeat assessment by echocardiogram showed no increase in pericardial effusion, but there was a new collection of fluid at the atrioventricular groove (Figure 3(a)), compressing on the left atrium. There was neither pulsus paradoxus on hemodynamic monitoring nor other echocardiographic features of cardiac tamponade. Doppler echocardiography showed an increased mitral inflow gradient of 8 mmHg, suggesting functional mitral stenosis (Figure 3(b)).Coronary sinus cannulation was attempted (Figure 4(a)), and the venogram showed no flow in coronary sinus (Figure 4(b)), suggesting extrinsic compression of the coronary sinus. Repeat pericardiocentesis was not attempted, as the fluid collection was posterior and there were no accessible windows.An urgent computed tomography scan was performed confirming the presence of the large 7.6 cm × 3.9 cm collection in the posterior aspect of the mediastinum extrinsically compressing and displacing the left atrium superiorly and to the right (Figure 5). The coronary sinus could not be visualized due to extrinsic compression by the hematoma.The patient was sent for emergent surgical evacuation of the hematoma with findings of large amounts of subepicardial hematoma, which had dissected the epicardium from the myocardium with left atrial compression. There were also multiple adhesions noted intraoperatively, likely from his previous cardiac bypass surgery. Hemodynamics improved after hemostasis and evacuation of clots compressing the left atrium and coronary sinus.However, the patient deteriorated multiple times during the hospital stay due to reaccumulation of hematoma and had to undergo repeat sternotomies and evacuation of hematoma. His course was complicated by oliguric acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy, sepsis, and ischemic stroke. He was supported by VA ECMO throughout and died seven weeks after his procedure due to multiorgan failure.The incidence of coronary perforation is reported to be 0.3–0.6% of all PCI procedures in combined reviews of approximately 50,000 cases [1, 2]. The incidence is usually higher with the use of newer devices such as rotational artherectomy, direction artherectomy, cutting balloon, and excimer laser, and when PCI is performed in postcardiac bypass patients. Most lesions can be treated by temporizing with balloon inflation at the site of perforation for up to 15 minutes to stop the blood flow into the pericardium, emergency pericardiocentesis if there are signs of hemodynamic instability, followed by placement of embolization coils for distal perforations or polytetrafluoroethylene membrane-covered stents to seal off further flow through the perforation [3, 4]. However, if there is continued bleeding or hemodynamic instability, emergency referral must be made to cardiothoracic surgery for surgical repair.Coronary sinus compression as a sign of cardiac tamponade secondary to increase pericardial pressure [5] and tamponade phenomena secondary to left atrial compression are rare and difficult to detect, with few case reports in literature [1, 3]. These cases mostly occur during intervention to the circumflex artery due to its position in relation to its surrounding structures.The circumflex artery, which branches off from the left main artery, runs along the atrioventricular groove around the left atrium, giving rise to left marginal branches in the process. It continues around the left atrium and terminates in the posterior inferior aspect of the heart. The coronary sinus, which receives drainage from the great, middle, and posterior left ventricular veins, is a low-pressure venous conduit that runs along the atrioventricular groove, which is in close proximity to the left circumflex artery [5]. Posterior to the left atrium lays the oblique pericardial sinus, bounded by the inferior vena cava, right pulmonary veins, and the left pulmonary veins.This case illustrates the anatomic and physiologic consequences during circumflex artery perforation. Blood collects in the oblique sinus, and as the left atrium is fixed to the parietal pericardium by the entry of the pulmonary veins, fluid in this fixed space accumulates pressure [6]. As the blood volume increases, pressure accumulates until it compresses on the low-pressure coronary sinus, obstructing the flow. Previous cardiac bypass surgery could have formed adhesions around the pericardium, preventing redistribution of blood around the pericardial space. As the coronary sinus provides the primary drainage of the myocardial venous system, abrupt occlusion is likely to result in significant elevation of the transcapillary pressure. This in turn is likely to result in reduced myocardial perfusion pressure, aggravating myocardial ischemia [7], explaining the patient’s ischemic ECG changes and arrhythmic collapse. Further blood collection in the oblique sinus will tamponade the left atrium and obstruct left atrial filling. The stroke volume consequently decreases and cardiac output drops, causing hypotension.There are few possible theories for the gradient across the mitral valve and functional mitral stenosis. Firstly, the hematoma externally compresses against the mitral annulus; this reduces the size of the mitral valve orifice and limits the movement of the annulus, affecting flow across the mitral valve. Secondly, the high external pressure from the hematoma obstructs filling of the atrium from the pulmonary veins; if the left ventricle function is relatively intact, this creates a suction force and gradient across the mitral valve.Although extremely rare, it is important to recognize such subtle signs of tamponade following perforation during coronary angioplasty, especially in the circumflex artery and post-bypass surgery patients. This life-threatening complication requires clinical awareness for rapid diagnosis, and emergent referral needs to be made to cardiothoracic surgery for surgical treatment.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Cardiac Lipoma: An Uncharacteristically Large Intra-Atrial Mass Causing Symptoms

Different autopsy series estimate the incidence to be anywhere from 0.001% to 0.19%. Cardiac lipoma is a rare type of tumour of the heart and pericardium. It comprises approximately 10–19% of all cardiac tumours. We present a case of a large cardiac lipoma in a fifty-year-old female. She presented with sharp chest pains, palpitations, and dizziness. Acute coronary syndrome was ruled out. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an abnormal, large, fixed right atrial mass. The mass was noted to be occupying most of the right atrium. It was excised due to its large size and persistent symptoms. On pathophysiology, the mass was definitively diagnosed to be an 80 mm × 70 mm cardiac lipoma. Postoperatively, the patient did well with resolution of her symptoms. This case provides evidence that even large, invasive, symptomatic cardiac lipomas can be successfully resected with good outcomes.Primary tumours of the heart are rarely encountered in clinical practice. Different autopsy series estimate the incidence to be anywhere from 0.001 to 0.19% [1, 2]. Cardiac lipomas comprise approximately 10–19% of all primary tumours of the heart and pericardium and make up 8.4% of all the benign ones [2, 3].Most cardiac lipomas remain small and do not cause symptoms, or if they do, they may remain asymptomatic for a long while [1, 4]. However, like the case here demonstrates, at times they can grow large and cause significant symptoms. When symptomatic, patients with cardiac lipoma can have various presentations, depending on the size and location of the tumour [3]. No clear guidelines have been established due to the low incidence of cardiac lipomas, but resection has been reported to be effective.A fifty-year-old female, presented to the emergency room, with central, sharp chest pain for about two hours. The pain radiated to the neck and caused left arm tingling. It was associated with nausea and diaphoresis. Independent of the chest pain, the patient complained of frequent palpitations for a few months which now were getting more frequent and prolonged. The patient also complained of episodes of dizziness for the last few days. These episodes were preceded by palpitations. Her past medical history included hypertension and an episode of transient ischemic attack. Her only home medication was aspirin 81 mg daily. Her physical examination was unremarkable.The patient had an EKG and serial troponins which were within normal limits. A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained for further workup. This showed an abnormal, large right atrial mass. For further characterization of the mass and to limit the acoustic window, a transoesophageal echocardiogram was obtained. It demonstrated a 40 mm × 57 mm, large solid, fixed mass with smooth contours occupying most of the dilated right atrium (Figure 1). The mass appeared to be attached to the inferior part of the right atrial septum. Coronary angiography was performed which did not show any obstructive coronary artery disease.A cardiothoracic surgery consultation was obtained for the patient. Since the tumour was well characterized on the TEE, any further imaging was not thought to be necessary. Given the patient’s significant symptoms and the large size of the mass, surgical resection was planned. A well-circumscribed, right atrial mass of 80 mm × 70 mm was removed (Figure 2). It was found to be involving the endocardium of the atrial septum, the right atrial wall, and the superior vena cava-right atrium junction. The atrial septum and the roof required reconstruction which was done with two Gore-Tex cardiovascular patches. In addition, reconstruction of the superior vena cava-right atrium junction was performed using interposition graft.The patient did well postoperatively. She had resolution of her symptoms. She did have intermittent asymptomatic junctional bradycardia which was monitored. We chose to anticoagulate her for three months due to the sutures that were placed inside the atrium.At her six-month follow-up, the patient appeared to be doing well. She, however, remained in junctional rhythm and was starting to become symptomatic with complaints of generalized weakness. A permanent pacemaker was therefore implanted without any complications.Cardiac lipomas are rare, benign tumours that usually remain small, asymptomatic, and are found incidentally on autopsy [1, 2]. This is a rare case where the tumour was large and was determined to be causing significant symptoms. Since surgical resection has been reported to have good outcomes, inclusion of cardiac lipoma in differentials is imperative.Lipomas in general are most commonly seen to have translocations involving chromosome 12 [5]. The etiology of cardiac lipomas remains undetermined. They are benign tumours of the heart that are mainly composed of mature adipocytes without any cellular atypia (Figures 3 and 4) [1–4]. They are usually well-encapsulated masses [1, 3]. Grossly, they appear as yellow fat divided by fine fibrous trabeculae [4]. The capsule is a major differentiation point between cardiac lipoma and lipomatous hypertrophy. The latter is usually an asymptomatic continuation of the epicardial fat, and when arising from the interatrial septum, it usually spares the fossa ovalis [2]. Unlike, cardiac lipomas which do not have any clear associations, lipomatous hypertrophy is seen more commonly in older, obese people and in females [3].Cardiac lipomas can originate from all the three cardiac tissue layers: most commonly being subendocardial, followed equally by subpericardial, and finally myocardial in location [3]. When intracardiac, they are most commonly found in the right atrium and the left ventricle but can be seen in almost any other location of the heart [1, 4]. They usually have a broad base or peduncle of attachment and are less mobile compared to other benign tumours of the heart [4, 6].Most cardiac lipomas do not cause symptoms or they may remain asymptomatic for a long time [1, 4]. They mas cause arrythmias, or symptoms due to invasion or mass effect [1, 2]. They can cause a whole spectrum of symptoms depending on their size and location including dyspnea, chest pain, arrhythmias, syncope, and stroke-like symptoms [2]. The mechanisms driving these symptoms include direct obstruction of intracardiac blood flow, dysfunction of cardiac valves, obstruction of the superior and inferior vena cava, and even phrenic nerve involvement [4]. Systemic or pulmonary thromboembolisms and pericardial effusion with or without tamponade have also been reported in the literature [3]. Apart from this, sudden death caused by cardiac lipoma has also been reported [7]. In our case, the patient had a history of TIA and presented with chest pain, palpitations, and dizziness which were probably associated with the growing right atrial tumour.Due to its easy availability and noninvasive nature, transthoracic echocardiography is the most common initial investigation to define the presence, extent, and location of cardiac tumours [2, 4]. Transoesophageal echocardiography has the benefit of not being limited by acoustic windows [6]. Echocardiography has a 90% sensitivity and a 95% specificity in detecting cardiac tumours and allows a dynamic evaluation of the mass with characterization of their physiologic consequences [3]. Both cardiac computerized tomography (CCT) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can help identify the presence of fat and so can be used to correctly diagnose cardiac lipoma [6]. They can characterize the composition of the tumour and hence aid in the differentiation between various types of cardiac tumours [3]. In addition, coronary angiography prior to surgery is recommended to exclude any coronary artery involvement and to identify a possible coronary source of the blood supply to the tumour [2–5].Due to the rare occurrence of cardiac lipomas, no guidelines have been established, but there is consensus that surgical resection should be attempted in all symptomatic patients [1, 2]. Complete excision along with the capsule is preferred to prevent local recurrence, even though the rate of recurrence of cardiac lipoma appears to be quite low despite subtotal resection [4]. Management of asymptomatic patients with incidentally found tumours remain less straightforward. Close monitoring is prudent in such patients. Depending on the size and rate of growth of the tumour, surgical intervention may be considered.Cardiac lipoma is quite a rare occurrence. In addition, it has a wide spectrum of presentation ranging from being asymptomatic to causing heart failure and to even causing sudden death. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary for a prompt diagnosis. The advancements in imaging technology have made preoperative diagnosis more accurate. In symptomatic patients with this benign tumour, surgery provides a curative rate of 95%, and the overall prognosis is considered quite good [3].The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.The authors would like acknowledge the contributions of Dr. Aaron L.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in a Nonagenarian with Aortic Aneurysm: Futility or Utility?
1Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Galway, Galway, Ireland2Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University Hospital Galway, Galway, Ireland3Department of Vascular Surgery, University Hospital Galway, Galway, IrelandCorrespondence should be addressed to Darren Mylotte; moc.liamg@ettolymnerradReceived 16 August 2017; Accepted 24 October 2017; Published 1 February 2018Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2018 Evelyn Fennelly et al.

There remain patients that are of such considerable risk that even TAVI can be futile. Such patients present ethical conundrums for institutional heart teams. Herein we present a case of a 90-year-old female patient with symptomatic severe AS and significant comorbidities including diffuse peripheral vascular disease and a large ascending aortic aneurysm. Would TAVI be utile or futile in this patient?While transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is now the standard of care for elderly patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) at high or excessive operative risk, there remain, however, patients of such high risk that even TAVI may be futile. Such cases present the institutional Heart Team with many difficult considerations and ethical dilemmas. We illustrate these issues through the case presentation of a nonagenarian patient with severe symptomatic AS, multiple comorbid illnesses, and anatomical contraindications to TAVI.We present the case of a 90-year-old female with symptomatic severe AS. She described an episode of presyncope and progressive dyspnea on exertion (NYHA Class III). Medical history included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, stroke, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and an ascending aortic aneurysm. She lived independently with Katz index of 6/6. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) confirmed severe AS (mean gradient 40 mmHg; aortic valve area 0.8 cm2), concomitant moderate aortic regurgitation, and preserved left ventricular function (ejection fraction 55%).Given the patient’s severe symptoms, advanced age, and associated comorbid illnesses, the patient was considered for TAVI. Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) showed a heavily calcified, tortuous iliofemoral vasculature (minimal lumen diameter (MLD) right: 5.7 mm; left: 5.8 mm), small subclavian arteries (MLD: 4.5 mm), and a bovine aortic arch (Figure 1). MSCT identified an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (maximum diameter: 46 mm). The diameter of the ascending aortic aneurysm was 60 mm. The trileaflet aortic valve was heavily calcified (annular dimensions: mean diameter 26.4 mm; area 542 mm2; perimeter 84.4 mm) (Figure 2).The institutional Heart Team considered her to be at excessive risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR): EuroSCORE II 17.10%; Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality 7.9%. A conservative management strategy was initially considered; however the patient and her family pressed for TAVI due to debilitating symptoms. Given the ascending aorta and aortic branch anatomy, a transfemoral TAVI with a surgical femoral arterial cut-down was considered to be the most appropriate vascular access route for implantation of a self-expanding transcatheter heart valve (THV). The periprocedural plan did not include transition to cardiopulmonary bypass as the patient had been declined traditional cardiac surgery by the institutional Heart Team.Under general anesthesia, the left common femoral artery was exposed, and an 18 Fr Cook (Cook Inc., Bloomington, IN, USA) vascular access sheath was inserted just cranial to a heavily calcified arterial segment. Sheath advancement to the descending aorta was challenging, though ultimately successful (Video 1). Heparin was administered to maintain an activated clotting time of >300 seconds. The stenotic aortic valve was crossed with some difficulty, and a stiff guide wire was placed in the left ventricle. Preimplant balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed with an 18 mm NuMED balloon (NuMED Inc., Hopkinton, NY, USA) under rapid ventricular pacing. A 31 mm Medtronic CoreValve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was deployed at an appropriate depth (3–6 mm), and transesophageal echocardiography and aortography suggested excellent valve function with mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation (Videos 2 and 3).Closure of the femoral arteriotomy was performed with a 6.0 Prolene. Control femoral angiography, however, showed occlusion of the common femoral artery just caudal to the puncture site (Figure 3(a); Video 4), and an area of extensive calcific plaque was observed on the screening MSCT (Figure 3(b)). In light of the extensive calcific disease, it was deemed that percutaneous recanalization of the artery would be impossible, and a common femoral endarterectomy was performed (Figure 3(c)). The patient subsequently required further surgical exploration for ongoing bleeding and needed transfusion with 10 units of packed red blood cells. She recovered quickly and was ambulating independently on discharge to respite care (postoperative day 8).The patient underwent routine follow-up, including outpatient review and surveillance echocardiography. Follow-up TTE at 6 months showed normal valve function, mean gradient of 6 mmHg, and mild paravalvular leak. Repeat MSCT showed a well-positioned valve, with the outflow floating in the ascending aortic aneurysm, without evidence of in situ thrombus, and no expansion of the ascending or descending aortic aneurysms (Figure 4). The patient remains asymptomatic at 12-month follow-up and will continue to undergo surveillance echocardiography annually.We present a challenging case of a nonagenarian with severe symptomatic AS, multiple comorbid illnesses, and anatomical contraindications to TAVI. This case presented an ethical dilemma to the Heart Team, given the extreme patient risk. Initially, we preferred a conservative management strategy, but when faced with the patient’s preference for definitive therapy, we elected to undertake transfemoral TAVI.This case underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to TAVI. The successful outcome for our patient was achieved with the collaboration of the cardiology, cardiothoracic, and vascular surgery teams, anesthesia, elderly medicine, and support services. The Heart Team model of care is recommended in both European and U.S. guidelines, which cite its role as essential in optimizing patient care [1, 2].Vascular access was particularly challenging in this case; the extensive severe PVD left few options for insertion of an 18 Fr vascular access sheath. Percutaneous transfemoral, transaortic, and transcarotid approaches were ruled out due to the calcific nature and small caliber of the femoral arteries, the aneurysmal ascending aorta, and the bovine aortic arch, respectively [3]. Transapical TAVI could have been an option, though may be associated with inferior clinical outcomes [4]. Transcaval TAVI has also emerged as a possible access route for no-option patients, though experience is limited [5]. Ultimately, we elected to push the boundaries of the transfemoral approach using a surgical cut-down to try minimize patient risk. The left common femoral artery MLD of 5.7 mm yielded a sheath to femoral artery ratio (SFAR) of 0.95. In calcified vessels, a SFAR > 1.0 is recommended to avoid vascular complications [6]. When the complication was encountered, the vascular team was on hand to undertake emergent surgery.Another major challenge in this case was the ascending aortic aneurysm. Aortic root dilation occurs in up to 3% of patients with severe AS [7]. Current American College of Cardiology recommendations suggest concomitant aneurysm repair during SAVR in those with an ascending aorta or aortic root > 45 mm in diameter [8]. Such recommendations do not apply to inoperable patients; the role of TAVI here remains unclear. Aortic root replacement aims to prevent future catastrophic dissection or rupture by restoring the normal dimension of the ascending aorta with a graft [9]. Untreated, such aneurysms remain exposed to the high velocity jet created by the stenotic valve, and this wall stress may induce dissection or rupture. The annual risk of death, rupture, or dissection for ascending aortic aneurysms of 60 to 69 mm in diameter is estimated to be 15.6% per year [10]. Critically, the risk of rupture increases 27-fold after 60 mm as there is an annual mean growth rate of 1 mm per year [10]. One could hypothesize that replacing the aortic valve alone (TAVI in this case) could reduce wall stress by removing the high-velocity jet caused by the stenotic valve [11, 12]. In contrast, the intervention itself could destabilize the aneurysm, and indeed the self-expanding prosthesis itself could exert forces on the aortic wall [9]. There are currently no published data on long-term changes in ascending aortic aneurysm sizes after TAVI.Valve thrombosis has recently been identified as a complication of bioprosthetic valve replacement, occurring in up to 40% of recipients [13]. This entity may be prosthesis-dependent and may be associated with atrial fibrillation [14]. An ascending aortic aneurysm may increase the risk of valve thrombosis, according to the principles of Virchow’s triad [15]. In this case, there was no evidence of valve thrombosis on MSCT after 6-month treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy.The case presented here demonstrates the importance of the institutional Heart Team in optimizing patient outcome with TAVI. We suggest cautiously that CoreValve implantation for inoperable older patients with ascending aortic root aneurysms is feasible and safe and in our patient was associated with symptomatic improvement.Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient for this manuscript.Dr. Mylotte is a proctor and consultant for Medtronic CoreValve.

Late Diagnosis of Anomalous Aortic Origin of a Coronary Artery from the Inappropriate Sinus of Valsalva during Investigation of Chest Pain
1Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery Department, São José do Rio Preto Medical School, São José do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil2Hemodynamic and Interventional Cardiology Service, Hospital de Base, São José do Rio Preto, SP, BrazilCorrespondence should be addressed to Wilson Pedro Guimarães Neto; moc.liamtoh@nsearamiugwReceived 17 July 2017; Revised 4 December 2017; Accepted 21 December 2017; Published 30 January 2018Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2018 Brunna Priscylla Américo Carvalho et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.In this work are reported two cases of anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA), with the left main coronary artery (LMCA) arising at the right sinus of Valsalva in a 77-year-old woman and in a 79-year-old man submitted to angiography after positive ischemic tests. The origin of the LMCA or the left descendant artery (LDA) from the right sinus of Valsalva has a prevalence of 0.2%, the origin of the circumflex artery (CXA) from the right sinus 0.5%, and the origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) from the left sinus of Valsalva has a prevalence of 0.3%. It is the subgroup of the coronary anomalies that has the greatest potential for clinical repercussions, especially the sudden cardiac death (SCD). We discuss the diagnostic methods and treatment options for this kind of coronary anomaly in symptomatic cases.The anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) is a rare disease with a range in prevalence from 0.3% to 1.5%, and it can be fatal depending on its anatomy [1, 2]. The symptoms may appear in childhood or only in adult life when the diagnosis is, most of the times, late due to normal ischemic tests. With the advancement of image methods, we may have a better understanding of the coronary anatomy and an early confirmation of this anatomical variant.The objective of this report is to show the image diagnosis of two cases of anatomical variation of the left main coronary artery that arises at the right semilunar leaflet of the aortic valve in patients evaluated in the emergency room for precordial pain and treatment options for the symptomatic cases.A 77-year-old woman, with high blood pressure, in use of atenolol and losartan, presented to the emergency room with a complaint of chest pain that began during rest, tightness-like, without irradiation, of great intensity, associated with nausea, becoming worse during inspiration, and getting better at rest. The initial electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, and the dosages of troponins were negative. A scintigraphy was performed with sestamibi that showed myocardial ischemia of small-to-moderate extension in the anteroseptal and inferoapical regions of the left ventricle (LV). Invasive stratification performed with coronary angiography showed an anomalous aortic origin of the left main coronary artery at the right semilunar cusp of the aortic valve, with a prepulmonic course and sharing a common ostium with the RCA (Figure 1). There were no significant coronary obstructions. Synchronized scintigraphy of cardiac chambers showed enlarged left ventricle with global contractile performance depressed in mild-to-moderate grades and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 0.36. As the coronary anomaly was a fortuitous discovery and not related to the myocardial perfusion imaging abnormalities, the patient was discharged for clinical treatment using furosemide 40 mg once a day, carvedilol 25 mg twice a day, losartan 50 mg twice a day, and simvastatin 40 mg per day.A 79-year-old man, farmer, with no history of medication intake, presented to the emergency room with chest pain, started at physical stress, tightness-like, of moderate intensity, without irradiation, without associated factors, and getting better at rest. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, without suggestive signals of myocardial ischemia, and dosages of troponins were negative. The scintigraphy with sestamibi showed myocardial ischemia of a small-to-moderate area, involving parts of the apical region and inferoapical and inferior regions of the left ventricle. Invasive stratification performed with coronary angiography showed the anomalous aortic origin of the left main coronary artery at the right semilunar cusp of the aortic valve. The CT angiography showed a long and trifurcated left main coronary artery, with a prepulmonic course (Figure 2). Once again, this AAOCA pattern was not recognized as potentially serious, and the patient was discharged asymptomatic.Coronary anomaly can be defined as any change in the anatomical pattern, such as the number of ostium, proximal course, distal bed, and it is rarely found in the general population [3].The anomalous aortic origin of the left main coronary artery from the right aortic sinus may be related to SCD, usually during or after exhausting exercise. It is currently the second most common cause of SCD in athletes [2]. The anatomical variation can follow five different paths: interarterial, subpulmonic (intraconal or intraseptal), prepulmonic, retroaortic, or retrocardiac. The interarterial variation is the pattern that has stronger relationship with SCD [2, 4, 5].In most cases of AAOCA, there are no symptoms, and the only clinical manifestation of the interarterial course may be SCD. When symptomatic, the patients may complain of syncope, chest pain, and palpitations. The lack of symptoms difficults the diagnosis. In symptomatic patients, the initial investigation should follow with electrocardiogram, stress testing, and echocardiography [5].The coronary angiography is traditionally the gold standard for the diagnosis of these anomalies, with the disadvantage of being an invasive test that uses potentially nephrotoxic contrast and ionizing radiation. Besides that, the usual two-dimensional images may generate failures in interpretation [6].On the other hand, computed tomography of coronary arteries has had a fast evolution as the coronary evaluation method. This method has shown excellent accuracy in evaluating the origin and proximal course of the coronary anomalies, being superior to coronary angiography. The middle and distal segments have also been better visualized. Some comparative studies with coronary angiography have shown superior efficiency, suggesting that multislice computed tomography is the ideal test for coronary anomaly diagnosis [3, 6].Transthoracic echocardiogram is the most useful method for children because it is not invasive and does not use radiation, contrast, or sedation. It also allows visualization of the origin of the coronary vessels [7].In asymptomatic patients, there is no consensus on treatment management. However, in symptomatic individuals, with interarterial course, surgical treatment should be the first option, but there are no data that define which is the best surgical technique to be used. Coronary artery bypass grafting should be avoided, unless there is concomitant obstructive coronary artery disease [4]. Surgical techniques are beyond the scope of this work and will not be discussed. In some symptomatic individuals or in cases with reversible myocardial ischemia, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers can be used in order to reduce ischemic symptoms [6, 7].The two cases presented above show patients with suspected acute coronary artery syndromes, in which the clinical investigation with invasive strategy diagnosed anomalous aortic origin of the left main coronary artery without atherosclerotic obstructions and no relationship with the myocardial ischemic changes. These case reports highlight this rare diagnostic possibility in patients undergoing angiography.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Aortic Dissection Presenting as Acute Pancreatitis: Suspecting the Unexpected
1Internal Medicine Department, Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, USA2Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Rochester, MI, USA3General Internal Medicine Division, Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Adam Hafeez; gro.tnomuaeb@zeefah.madaReceived 1 October 2017; Accepted 26 November 2017; Published 30 January 2018Academic Editor: Takatoshi KasaiCopyright © 2018 Adam Hafeez et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition in which the inner layer of the aorta tears. Blood surges through the tear, causing the inner and middle layers of the aorta to separate (dissect). It is considered a medical emergency. We report a case of a healthy 56-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with sudden onset of epigastric pain radiating to his back. His blood pressure was 167/91 mmHg, equal in both arms. His lipase was elevated at 1258 U/L, and he was clinically diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP). He denied any alcohol consumption, had no evidence for gallstones, and had normal triglyceride level. Two days later, he endorsed new suprapubic tenderness radiating to his scrotum, along with worsening epigastric pain. A MRCP demonstrated evidence of an aortic dissection (AD). CT angiography demonstrated a Stanford type B AD extending into the proximal common iliac arteries. His aortic dissection was managed medically with rapid blood pressure control. The patient had excellent recovery and was discharged home without any surgical intervention.Aortic dissection remains the deadliest manifestation of acute aortic syndromes with mortality as high as 1% per hour for acute type A aortic dissections [1]. The classical clinical presentation of an aortic dissection is of a male in his 60s who presents to the emergency room with sudden onset tearing or ripping chest pain. Hypertension, noted on vitals and with physical exam maneuvers such as blood pressure discrepancies in the arms, can help make the diagnosis. However, more importantly, the presentation can vary, and the classical symptoms may be absent or inconsistent [2]. This can paint a diagnostic dilemma for the clinician.Acute pancreatitis has been increasing in incidence, with estimates of an increase in 20% in admissions over the last 10 years in the United States [3]. Acute pancreatitis also presents with severe epigastric pain which often radiates to the back. Diagnosis can be made with two of the three following features: (1) abdominal pain, (2) elevated serum lipase or amylase at least three times the upper limit of normal, and (3) characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or even ultrasound [4]. Therefore, the diagnosis can be made clinically without imaging.The presentation of acute pancreatitis in the setting of aortic dissection poses a diagnostic challenge, as some of the cardinal symptoms of aortic dissection, such as hypertension and pain, overlap with acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is a clinical diagnosis, but without an easily identifiable cause, such as gallstones, alcohol abuse, or hypertriglyceridemia, further imaging may be warranted if the patient does not clinically improve. Due to its lethal complications, physicians should be aware and should have a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection when evaluating a patient with presumed acute pancreatitis.Acute pancreatitis presenting as acute aortic dissection is a rare entity with less than ten well-documented cases reported so far. It is hypothesized that the pancreas can be susceptible to hypoperfusion as seen in cardiopulmonary bypass surgery [3]. We present a case misdiagnosed as only acute pancreatitis based on clinical symptoms and later correctly diagnosed as an aortic dissection when symptoms did not improve.A 56-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency room with the chief complaint of sudden onset of substernal chest pain radiating to his back. His family history was noncontributory. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. The patient worked as a traveling musician. He denied any recent trauma. Initial vitals revealed hypertension (167/91 mmHg). Physical exam was significant for reproducible midepigastric pain, without guarding or rebound. Chest and abdominal radiographs were unremarkable. The patient had a mild leukocytosis (10.9 bil/L), elevated lipase (1258 U/L), elevated amylase (163 U/L), normal triglycerides, and negative autoimmune workup (Table 1). His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 80 beats/minute, normal axis, normal interval durations, and no signs of acute or chronic ischemia or left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Abdominal US was negative for cholelithiasis. He had no recent procedures performed and was on no medications prior to presentation. He was treated with IV fluids and bowel rest for presumed acute pancreatitis diagnosed clinically because of elevated lipase and epigastric pain. An abdominal CT scan to assess the severity of pancreatitis was not indicated to be performed as the patient’s clinical symptoms were stable. Throughout his admission, his pain never fully resolved. On day 5, he developed a marked increase in blood pressure (194/112 mmHg). He was diaphoretic on exam with worsening of his epigastric pain. He also endorsed new suprapubic pain radiating to his scrotum along with dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Because of the acute worsening of the patient’s condition, a MRCP was ordered to examine the pancreas and the hepatobiliary tree. Incidentally, the MRCP demonstrated evidence of a large aortic dissection (Figure 1). CT angiography demonstrated a Stanford type B AD (Figure 2) extending into the proximal common iliac arteries (Figure 3) that explained his new suprapubic and scrotum pain. There was no radiographic evidence of peripancreatic inflammatory changes or fluid collections.The patient’s pancreatitis was treated with bowel rest, IV fluids, and pain medication. The patient’s aortic dissection was treated with IV labetalol and nitroprusside in the ICU with rapid lowering of his blood pressure. No surgical intervention was performed.Aortic dissection remains a devastating vascular catastrophe with a high mortality rate if not diagnosed and managed promptly. However, its signs and symptoms are unpredictable. As the dissection progresses, other organs can be affected and can obscure the inciting diagnosis. Pancreatitis remains a rare complication of aortic dissection, and the association between the two has yet to be elucidated. A retrospective study by Li et al. examining the forensic characteristics of patients who suffered sudden unexpected deaths due to an aortic dissection showed that 83.9% of the patients were misdiagnosed and the dissection was not recognized. Of these, only one case was diagnosed as acute pancreatitis, which highlights the rarity of this presentation [5]. To our knowledge, there are only ten well-documented cases reported worldwide. Recently, Pham and Nable described a case of a woman with an exacerbation of several months of abdominal pain that was clinically diagnosed with pancreatitis based on epigastric pain as well as elevated lipase (723 U/L). Unlike our case, the woman had a prior history of aortic aneurysmal repair. An abdominal CT was pursued to look for any complications of pancreatitis. She was found to have an incidental Stanford type B aortic dissection [6].The International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) database recognizes malperfusion in 21% of the patients with Stanford type B aortic dissection. However, acute pancreatitis is not described as an ischemic complication of acute aortic dissection in the IRAD [7]. Common risk factors for acute pancreatitis are gallbladder disease, chronic alcohol consumption, and recent procedures. Rarely, hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia, autoimmune disorders, or medications can induce pancreatitis [3]. A limited number of case studies reported an association of acute aortic dissection with acute pancreatitis. Masaki reports a case of a middle-aged man diagnosed first with Stanford type B aortic dissection with the true lumen supplying the celiac trunk and splenic artery. Due to thrombosis of the false lumen, the true lumen became narrow. The patient developed upper abdominal pain as well as an elevation in pancreatic amylase. A CT showed peripancreatic fluid [8]. These findings were consistent with acute pancreatitis. As the acute pancreatitis developed hours after aortic dissection, it was thought that possible ischemia-reperfusion injury initiated the acute pancreatitis. A similar case was described by Zheng et al; however, the patient was found to have a type A aortic dissection when a CT scan was performed to confirm the diagnosis after management of acute pancreatitis had already begun [9].Ischemic injury to the pancreas occurring in clinical situations such as shock or major cardiac surgery is rare. For example, ischemic injury to the pancreas following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery has been reported to occur with an incidence of less than 1% [10]. Similarly, resection or repair of an aortic aneurysm has been shown to induce pancreatitis [11]. Aortic dissection can, like cardiopulmonary bypass surgery or manipulation of the aorta, produce a hypoperfused state leading to ischemic injury to the pancreas. However, the injury seen in the pancreas may not be as severe as other organs, such as the kidney or liver. It is hypothesized that this can be due to rich collateral blood supply to the pancreas [12]. Notably, the pancreatic head receives blood supply from the superior mesenteric artery. The body and tail, on the other hand, can receive blood not only from branches of the splenic artery but also from branches originating from the celiac or superior mesenteric arteries as well as the splenic hilum itself [12]. This may explain why the acute pancreatitis caused by hypoperfusion may remain mild and not produce radiographic evidence of pancreatitis, as seen in our patient. Additionally, an acute aortic dissection is a dynamic process, and it is possible that transient malperfusion may take place as the dissection progresses. Therefore, the lipase may reflect ischemic injury that has resolved.Due to the arterial collaterals supplying the pancreas, it is likely that hypoperfusion may not be the only factor at play. Another hypothesis comes from a case report of a patient that suffered severe necrotic pancreatitis caused by a type B aortic dissection [13]. It was hypothesized that cholesterol emboli from the dissecting aorta were the main cause of the pancreatic necrosis [13]. In our case, there was no such evidence for any embolic phenomena.As noted, the kidney, heart, brain, and liver are commonly affected by shock. The pancreas is not regularly believed to be affected, although pathophysiologically can suffer ischemia like any other organ. Warshaw and O’Hara et al. retrospectively studied autopsies of patients who died due to shock after repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms or open heart surgery. He found a 9% incidence of pancreatic injury in this patient group. More interestingly, there was a strong positive correlation with presence of renal ischemic injury, with 50% concomitant pancreatic injury in the setting of acute tubular necrosis () [14]. The author noted that it was ischemia, not operative trauma, which led to pancreatic injury. More so, all the patients with shock that were followed prospectively had elevated lipase levels but no signs or symptoms of pancreatitis. This is similar to our case report in the sense that the patient had elevated lipase and aortic dissection-related pain but no evidence of acute pancreatitis on imaging.As the precise etiology of pancreatitis following aortic dissection continues to be elucidated, what remains is the diagnostic challenge of efficiently differentiating between the clinical manifestations of aortic dissection and other etiologies of acute abdominal pain such as acute cardiac ischemia, pancreatitis, or intestinal obstruction. Imaging remains at the heart of this differentiation, but this may not always be cost-effective, efficient, and noninvasive. Most patients with severe hypoperfusion will be having renal ischemia, and adding contrast agents for imaging may not be ideal. Wen et al. researched the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteases that have been indicated in aortic aneurysms to correlate with aortic-wall proteolysis, as a diagnostic tool for detection of aortic dissection. MMPs also have been shown to be elevated in patients with pancreatitis. They prospectively studied 20 patients each with aortic dissection and acute pancreatitis within 1 hour of symptom onset in the emergency room and found that MMPs were higher in patients with acute AD as compared to acute pancreatitis () [15]. It is possible that, in the future, MMPs to be used as a marker to help differentiate between the two causes of severe epigastric pain. Although more research into optimal markers and imaging needs to be done, the burden rests on the clinician’s shoulders to keep a wide differential diagnosis. If an etiology is not identified, further imaging must be pursued sooner rather than later to rule out rarer etiologies for pancreatitis and to also assess for other possible etiologies in the same anatomical region, that is, aortic dissection.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

We report a case of cardiac aspergilloma with involvement of the tricuspid valve and both the right atrium and ventricle found on a transthoracic echocardiogram in an immunocompromised patient after developing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. The findings from this case suggest that early clinical suspicion is critical in early diagnosis and thus early treatment.Aspergillus is a common fungus in the environment that can cause fatal diseases in humans. The Aspergillus spores are easily inhaled, and immunocompromised individuals are known to be more susceptible to its disease. Acute invasive aspergillus of the heart is particularly uncommon. Aspergillus endocarditis accounts for 20–25% of all cases of fungal endocarditis, and fungal endocarditis only comprises <2% of all cases of endocarditis [1, 2]. Invasive aspergillus involving heart valves and chambers is even rarer with only a handful of cases reported in the literature. In this report, we present a case of cardiac aspergilloma involving the native tricuspid valve and both the right atrium and ventricle that initially presented as a cardiac mass in an immunocompromised patient.A 62-year-old male presented to an outlying hospital with a one-month history of productive cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent fevers, and a syncopal episode one week before. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, prostatic adenocarcinoma with bone metastasis, atrial fibrillation, and bilateral pulmonary embolism. The prostatic adenocarcinoma was diagnosed 11 months before, and he developed the bilateral pulmonary embolism approximately 8 months before. He completed 40 cycles of radiation, and medications included Zytiga in conjunction with prednisone, Lupron, and Eliquis. He was a former smoker and smoked a maximum of 5 cigarettes daily for 35 years. His social history was otherwise negative for high-risk sexual behavior, intravenous (IV) drug use, recent travel, and occupational exposure. He was subsequently admitted with a diagnosis of anemia with hemoglobin of 7.1 g/dL and sepsis secondary to presumed pneumonia.On admission, the patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells for anemia. The patient was also noted to have thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 48,000/mcL; thus, Eliquis was held. Chest X-ray revealed a 7.4 cm opacity in the right lung base as well as multiple right pulmonary nodules (Figure 1). A CT chest showed similar findings with the addition of extensive bone metastasis. The patient was started on vancomycin and Zosyn for sepsis while awaiting blood culture results. Infectious workup was positive for Aspergillus fumigatus IgG, Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (Ag), Histoplasma Ag, Fungitell, and Blastomyces antibody (Ab). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and influenza A and B serologies were negative. Blood cultures were negative for viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Infectious diseases were consulted. The patient subsequently underwent a bronchoscopy, with lavage specimens returning positive for Aspergillus Ag but negative for pneumocystis pneumonia, HSV, bacteria, fungus including Histoplasma, and malignant cells. The patient was then diagnosed with presumed subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillus. Antibiotics were then discontinued, and the patient was discharged with voriconazole for a 6-week duration.Two days after discharge, he was admitted for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed and showed a highly mobile 5 cm mass involving the tricuspid valve with variable involvement of the right atrium and right ventricle (Figure 2). The ejection fraction was preserved. Infectious diseases and oncology were then consulted. The patient remained on voriconazole, and Zytiga was discontinued as his prostate cancer was castration sensitive, per oncology. CT surgery was consulted and performed sternotomy with resection of the mass, portions of the right atrium and ventricle, and tricuspid valve on day 2 of admission. The excised mass was pale yellow and pink, irregularly shaped, fragmented, bulky, and approximately 3 × 2 × 1.3 cm (Figure 3). Pathology from the mass and tricuspid valve showed necrotic debris with acute inflammation and abundant fungal hyphae (Figure 4). Cultures obtained from tissue in the operating room were positive for Aspergillus fumigatus and negative for bacteria and viruses.The patient did well postoperatively. He was extubated to nasal cannula within 12 hours; however, he remained on pressor support. Voriconazole was continued. On day 4 of admission, he developed septic shock, renal failure with oliguria and acidosis, and shock liver requiring increased pressor support. He continued to deteriorate the next day requiring endotracheal intubation and ventilator support. On day 5 of admission, the patient developed ventricular tachycardia followed by pulseless electrical activity. Shortly thereafter, he was pronounced dead. The cause of death was invasive aspergillosis-induced septic shock with multiorgan failure.Aspergilloma of the heart is a rare disease that carries a very poor prognosis. On review of the current literature, only a small number of cases have been reported. These cases include an invasive aspergillus of the interventricular septum in an allogenic stem cell transplant patient [3], aspergilloma involving all four chambers of the heart [4], aspergillosis presenting as a pedunculated mass with multiple nodules on the left ventricular wall in an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient [5], a large right ventricular aspergilloma in a young man on chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia [6], an incidental finding of a tricuspid valve aspergilloma after abdominal surgery [7], and the three cases described in the correspondence by Wiwanitkit and Wiwanitkit [8]. Of note, all except for one of the aforementioned cases resulted in death within days to weeks after diagnosis.Fungal endocarditis alone, without involvement of the surrounding cardiac structure, is associated with a mortality rate of at least 50% with an average survival period of 11 days [9]. Fungal endocarditis has also recently been shown to have increasing prevalence with medical and surgical advancements [1, 2]. Historically, the main risk factors for developing fungal endocarditis included previous valve surgery, history of prosthetic valve endocarditis, prolonged use of antibiotics, rheumatic heart disease, and IV drug use [1]. Most recent studies suggest that these characteristics have changed and that fungal endocarditis now more commonly affects immunocompromised patients, patients with prosthetic valves and central venous catheters, and those on broad-spectrum antibiotics [1, 2]. Of note, Aspergillus endocarditis is mostly found on aortic or mitral prosthetic valves [10] and has a mortality rate of approximately 80% [2].Prolonged fever, as seen in the described case, is the most common presenting feature; however, some patients may present with new or changing heart murmur, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, weakness, or generalized pain. Hemorrhagic black skin lesions have been reported in Aspergillus endocarditis [11]. Such symptoms in combination with leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia may also be suggestive of fungal septicemia. As discussed earlier, an immunocompromised state, neutropenia, recent history of long-term central venous catheter, prosthetic heart valve, steroid use, prolonged antibiotic therapy, recent prolonged hospitalization, parenteral nutrition, immunocompromised status, and IV drug use predispose patients to an invasive fungal infection.With the diverse symptoms and risk factors, the diagnosis of fungal endocarditis is rather challenging and can be easily delayed without a high clinical suspicion, especially given that fungal pathogens are slow growing. Diagnosis is further complicated as the majority of fungi are not detected in blood cultures. Aspergillus, in particular, is positive in 4–30% of blood cultures in cases of Aspergillus endocarditis [2, 12]. Some reviews have also suggested testing for galactomannan antigen, which is released when Aspergillus proliferates [1, 12]. TTE is a valuable diagnostic tool in diagnosing endocarditis and has been shown to identify 89% and 76.5% of the vegetations in native and prosthetic valves, respectively [2]. Although vegetations seen on TTE may not distinguish between bacterial versus fungal etiology, fungal vegetations are typically characterized as a large, bulky, highly mobile mass, as seen in the described case, and cause an increased risk of embolic events, more commonly affecting the brain. Still, many cases of fungal endocarditis are diagnosed during surgery or autopsy.Upon diagnosing fungal invasion of the heart, a multidisciplinary team involving cardiology, infectious diseases, and cardiovascular surgery is necessary. Most recent reviews as well as Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines favor a combined medical and early surgical intervention for treatment of Aspergillus endocarditis, pericarditis, and myocarditis. Surgical valve replacement in addition to systemic antifungal therapy was noted to be pertinent to survival due to poor prognosis and risk of relapse in patients receiving only pharmacological therapy, decreased effect of antifungal medication on fungal vegetations, large vegetations possibly compromising cardiac function, and the risk of embolic events [1, 12]. Per IDSA, the recommended initial antifungal agents are voriconazole or liposomal amphotericin B 3–5 mg/kg/day, followed by lifelong antifungal treatment postsurgical valve replacement [13]. Amphotericin B is preferred for patients with hepatic insufficiency [12]. Some have proposed using caspofungin in addition to voriconazole and amphotericin [14]; however, the use of combining antifungal therapies has not been shown to be superior to monotherapy [13]. In the described case, the patient was already on voriconazole and underwent surgical resection.The differential diagnosis for the cardiac mass beyond a fungal etiology includes thrombus, primary cardiac tumor, myxoma, metastatic lesion, and lymphoma. Though the patient had new-onset atrial fibrillation, a thrombus was unlikely as he had been on apixaban for approximately 6-7 months. Prostate cancer does not typically metastasize to the heart; thus, metastasis was also unlikely. Given the patient’s immunocompromised state, being on steroids, and recent diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, the clinical suspicion for a fungal mass was high. Hematogenous spread of invasive pulmonary aspergillus was considered in the development of cardiac aspergilloma. The spread of invasive pulmonary aspergillus to the heart is very rare and is associated with a high mortality estimated to be as high as 80–90% [15], which is approximately the same mortality rate of having Aspergillus endocarditis alone, despite aggressive pharmacological and surgical interventions [2]. However, the hematogenous spread of invasive pulmonary aspergillus would be expected to invade the left cardium rather than the right, as seen in our patient.In considering the described case, prior to discovering the cardiac aspergilloma, the patient was already on antifungal therapy. Furthermore, once a fungal mass was suspected, the patient underwent surgery and continued antifungal treatment as per recommendations. The overall outcome, nonetheless, was grim.Cardiac aspergilloma remains a rare yet deadly disease that carries a high mortality rate despite aggressive pharmacological and surgical interventions. Decreasing the mortality rate remains a challenging task, given the nature of the disease and diagnostic barriers to detecting the disease early on. While innovative molecular methods can detect the diagnosis sooner than was previously possible, clinical suspicion remains the key to diagnosing the disease. Early clinical suspicion will lead to early treatment, and earlier treatment will presumably result in decreased mortality.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.The authors thank Dr. Janeen N.

Spontaneous Regression of Cardiac Rhabdomyoma Presenting as Severe Left Ventricular Inlet Obstruction in a Neonate with Tuberous Sclerosis
Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Medical School, Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju, Republic of KoreaCorrespondence should be addressed to Young Kuk Cho; ten.liamnah@xcgnuoyReceived 4 June 2017; Accepted 27 November 2017; Published 28 January 2018Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2018 Eun Song Song et al.

Although most cardiac rhabdomyomas become smaller with time, emergency intervention is indicated when severe obstruction has occurred. In this report, we describe the spontaneous regression of a large cardiac rhabdomyoma (20.5 × 15.6 mm) presenting as severe left ventricular inlet obstruction in a neonate with tuberous sclerosis. Although a cardiac rhabdomyoma can be large enough to induce left ventricular inlet obstruction, conservative treatment without aggressive surgical intervention can be considered if the hemodynamic condition does not deteriorate.Rhabdomyoma is the most common cardiac tumor in infants and children and is reported in up to 50–64% of infants with tuberous sclerosis [1, 2]. Its expression ranges from subclinical to fatal presentation, according to the onset age and the site, size, and degree of invasion [3]. Although rhabdomyomas become smaller with time, when severe obstruction induces hemodynamic instability or a rhythm abnormality, emergency intervention is indicated [4–6]. Rhabdomyoma causing left ventricular (LV) inlet obstruction can necessitate an emergency operation [3, 7–10]. However, there is no recorded report of spontaneous resolution of a huge cardiac rhabdomyoma causing LV inlet obstruction. We report a case of spontaneous regression of a large symptomatic cardiac rhabdomyoma presenting as severe LV inlet obstruction, occupying 75–90% of the mitral valve (MV) annulus in a neonate with tuberous sclerosis.A male infant was born at 39 weeks of gestation by vaginal delivery to a healthy 35-year-old female. There was no family history of congenital heart disease or tuberous sclerosis. At 31 weeks of gestation, a fetal echocardiogram revealed a large, solitary LV mass and multiple right ventricular (RV) masses. The delivery was uneventful. The Apgar score was 10 at both 1 and 5 minutes. Birth weight of 3,450 g, length of 51.0 cm, and head circumference of 35.5 cm were normal. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation was 95% on room air, heart rate was 132 bpm, respiratory rate was 48/minute, arterial pressure was 62/38 mmHg, a grade 2/6 mid-diastolic rumbling murmur was heard at the left sternal border, and there were no skin lesions. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary vascular markings. Transcranial ultrasonography was normal.Two-dimensional echocardiographic examination revealed a large solitary tumor measuring 20.5 × 15.6 mm and occupying 75–90% of the mitral annulus (Figures 1(a)–1(c)). This tumor was attached to the anterior leaflet of the MV, causing LV inlet obstruction. The peak velocity through the MV was 1.66 m/s (Figure 1(d)). Right atrial and RV dilatation and pressure overload secondary to pulmonary hypertension were observed (Figure 1(e)). The peak jet velocity through the regurgitant tricuspid valve was 4.13 m/s (Figure 1(f)). Mild mitral regurgitation (MR), left atrial (LA) enlargement without LV dilatation, and multiple small tubers in both ventricles and the LV outflow tract were observed (Figures 1(a)–1(c)). LV ejection fraction was normal at 67.2%. Although the newborn had mild subcostal chest retractions, his vital signs were stable; therefore, inotropes and oxygen were not provided. At 5 h of age, paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia at 240 bpm developed. Because intermittent supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with desaturation and irritability continued, repeated doses of adenosine were administered intravenously to restore sinus rhythm. Digoxin was started for long-term management and the tachyarrhythmia resolved. Genetic analysis was performed to detect mutations of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2 genes. TSC1 mutation was absent, but a TSC2 mutation (c.5161–1G > C) was detected. Ophthalmic examination revealed a jagged-edged, linear depigmented retina in the right eye. During the 14-day hospital stay, blood pressure was well maintained without inotropes, tachypnea improved, the frequency of breast-feeding increased, and weight gain was observed. Follow-up chest X-ray showed regression of cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular markings. Follow-up echocardiography demonstrated decreased MR and pulmonary hypertension and normal systolic LV function. The infant was discharged with only digoxin to prevent arrhythmias.At 40 days of age, symptoms and signs associated with LV inlet obstruction and tachyarrhythmia were absent. Echocardiography showed good LV function with decreased rhabdomyoma size (16.8 × 11.5 mm). At 3 months of age, a tonic-type seizure occurred and right frontal cortical tubers, multifocal white-matter lesions, and subependymal nodules were discovered on brain magnetic resonance imaging (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Vigabatrin as an antiepileptic drug was started. Depigmented skin lesions were also found that time on the right shoulder and chest.At 6 months of age, echocardiography revealed a further decrease in rhabdomyoma size (13.8 × 12.1 mm); the lesion occupied a smaller portion (about 50%) of the mitral annulus (Figure 3(a)). Tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension were improved. MR and LA dilatation were not observed. Digoxin was maintained up to 24 months of age. After discontinuation of medication, no further tachyarrhythmias occurred.At 3 years of age, echocardiography showed a very small (6.5 × 2.3 mm), ellipse-shaped rhabdomyoma attached to the MV anterior leaflet without LV inlet obstruction (peak velocity = 0.76 m/s) (Figures 3(b) and 3(c)). At that time, fibroadenomas began to develop on the face. Convulsions were controlled by vigabatrin and topiramate. A developmental delay of about 18 months was apparent.Although cardiac rhabdomyomas are known to spontaneously regress in patients with tuberous sclerosis, many complications associated with tumor location and size are possible [1–3]. Some patients are very symptomatic, with signs of severe heart failure or valve dysfunction due to blood flow obstruction, and even univentricular physiology [7]. Only five case reports of hemodynamically significant LV inflow obstruction caused by cardiac rhabdomyoma have been published (Table 1). Four cases were associated with tuberous sclerosis [3, 7, 9, 11], and most were detected in infancy and the perinatal period. The other case involved a tumor detected in adulthood. Common initial symptoms were related to heart failure, including cyanosis and dyspnea with or without cardiomegaly [9]. Surgical resection of tumor was performed in four patients in whom the lesions were attached to the septum. A 1-day-old infant underwent atrial septostomy by cardiac catheterization due to hemodynamic instability.In our case, a large rhabdomyoma (20.5 × 15.6 mm) occupied 75–90% of the LV inlet and caused obstruction, LA enlargement, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient did not undergo surgical intervention because he was hemodynamically stable. Since the rhabdomyoma was attached to the anterior leaflet of the MV, there was a risk of valve dysfunction after surgery. With increasing age, the LV inflow obstruction was attenuated by decreasing rhabdomyoma and increasing mitral annulus size. At 3 years of age, the rhabdomyoma had decreased to an ellipse-shaped mass 6.5 × 2.3 mm in size and showed no LV flow disturbance. Repeat echocardiography to confirm hemodynamic stability played a critical role in determining treatment. Many reports have emphasized the usefulness of echocardiography in the management of cardiac rhabdomyoma in neonates or children. Di Liang et al. [11] described serial echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac rhabdomyoma. Follow-up echocardiography revealed that of 22 tumors in 8 patients, 7 completely regressed, 7 partially regressed, and 8 remained stable. In addition, Batmaz et al. [12] reported a huge spherical rhabdomyoma originating from the MV in an asymptomatic patient with a murmur and experienced spontaneous regression with conservative treatment alone. In the present case, the neonate had an arrhythmia and evidence of congestive heart failure. Hemodynamic stability was confirmed accurately and continuously with echocardiography. Therefore, we provided conservative treatment.Although a cardiac rhabdomyoma can be large enough to induce LV inlet obstruction, conservative treatment without aggressive surgical intervention can be considered if hemodynamic conditions do not deteriorate. In addition, repeated echocardiography may play a pivotal role in understanding hemodynamic status and establishing a treatment plan.This case was presented at the poster session of the annual conference of Korean Pediatrics Society held in Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday, November 10, 2016.The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.This study was supported by a grant (NRF-2015R1D1A1A01059017) of the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea.
Giant Left Ventricular Thrombus in a Patient with Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Case Report and Minireview
1College of Medicine, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32827, USA2Department of Medicine and Graduate Medical Education, North Florida Regional Medical Center, Gainesville, FL 32605, USA3North Florida Regional Medical Center, The Cardiac and Vascular Institute, Gainesville, FL 32605, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Fan Ye; ude.fcu@ey.nafReceived 25 October 2017; Accepted 18 December 2017; Published 14 January 2018Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2018 Fan Ye et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 56-year-old healthy male with no obvious risk factors or significant past medical history was admitted to the emergency room with acute ischemic stroke. On his transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), an extremely large thrombus was detected at the apex involving the distal anterior wall. The thrombus was predominantly adherent but with a mobile tip. The patient was subsequently managed with dual antiplatelet therapy. In this report, we present an interesting case of an acute ischemic stroke secondary to a giant left ventricular thrombus in a patient with no past significant cardiac or neurologic medical history.Left ventricular thrombus was one of the most feared complications in patients with severe ischemic heart disease including myocardial infarction (MI) or left ventricular (LV) aneurysm [1]. Protrusion and mobility of thrombus carry a high risk for recurrent embolic strokes. The majority of reported cases of left ventricular thrombus were complications of acute MI, though it is a relatively rare complication in this day and age of expeditious revascularization but can be devastating if not diagnosed early on. However, the data on patients with large LV thrombus but without cardiac or thrombotic history are deficient.A 56-year-old Caucasian male patient with no past significant medical history or thrombotic medication use presented to the hospital with right arm weakness, slurred speech, and vertigo continuing for less than 24 hours. He had never been a smoker or illicit drug user. He was physically active and only drank socially. He had no family history of cardiovascular, pulmonary, or hypercoagulable diseases.In his initial evaluation, brain computer tomography (CT) showed acute/subacute infarct of the right posterior frontal region, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed acute infarct in the left inferior frontal/suprasylvian region, and head/neck CT angiography (CTA) scan revealed no evidence for large vessel occlusion or visualized intraluminal clot. He was admitted to the neurological unit with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke and was treated with dual antiplatelet therapy using aspirin and clopidogrel. The ECG revealed sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular complexes and low-voltage QRS (Figure 1). The lipid panel was normal as well as kidney and liver function. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) detected anterior and apical wall akinesias with an LV ejection fraction (EF) of 25–30%, structurally normal valves, and an extremely large thrombus (10 cm × 12 cm) invading the apex and distal anterior wall which was predominantly adherent but with a mobile tip (Figure 2). Troponin × 3 was negative, and coagulability workup was within normal range. Subsequent myocardial perfusion imaging revealed severe hypokinesis involving the mid and apical anterior, mid anteroseptal, basal and mid inferoseptal, and basal, mid, and apical inferior wall of the left ventricle, consistent with infarction in the distribution of multiple vessels, with partial viability.Both the cardiovascular surgeon and cardiologist agreed that the majority of the thrombus appeared densely adherent with only a small portion being somewhat mobile on echocardiography and determined the risk of myocardial resection with surgery outweighed the benefits. As a result, the patient was managed medically with aspirin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, and apixaban 5 mg bid. In addition, carvedilol 6.25 mg bid and lisinopril 10 mg daily were initiated for treatment of the ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient was discharged three days later without any medicine side effects. We recommended a renal profile, complete blood count in three days, and TTE monthly.In our patient, no particular features were encountered to suggest cardiac or vascular etiology to the stroke, yet a large thrombus was detected.The rare incidence of left ventricular thrombus has been reported in other diseases, including takotsubo cardiomyopathy [2], heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [3], Behçet disease [4], and disseminated intravascular coagulation [5]. There are limited data as to the exact frequency of LV thrombus in patients with ischemic stroke, but it has been reported to be about 2.4% in symptomatic patients by transesophageal echocardiography [6]. However, most of these studies were retrospective, nonserial, or autopsy reports. Although our patient had no significant past medical history, we speculate that his LV thrombus was secondary to his ischemic cardiomyopathy. The thrombus became firmly attached to the left ventricle, enhancing the underlying myocardial scar, limiting potential infarct expansion, and partially protecting against LV rupture. As a consequence, the patient had no symptoms until the tip of the thrombus became mobile and occluded his CNS perfusion.Thrombi in the heart occur predominantly in males and are accompanied with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy including valvular abnormalities, arrhythmias, thromboembolism, pericarditis, and myocarditis [7]. We have recently reported that the lack of mobility is one of the key factors in most risk assessment models of thromboembolism [8]. In our patient, potential underlying myocardial ischemia caused subendothelial injury with inflammatory changes, and left ventricle regional wall akinesia resulted in blood stasis. This combination contributed to the in vivo thrombus formation [9].The optimal management of large and pedunculated left ventricular thrombus is still controversial, especially those with low LVEF. The management is particularly challenging in patients with high bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, etc.) have been reported in successfully treating left venous thrombus, without having limitations of vitamin K antagonists which include slow onset of action, regular monitoring, and need for dose adjustments [10]. Further evidence demonstrated that new oral anticoagulants were found to be noninferior or superior compared to warfarin in prevention of thromboembolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [11]. Surgical removal is generally recommended for mobile thrombi due to a significant increase in embolization risk. However, deterioration of LV function, introduction of ventricular arrhythmia, and potential dissection of the left ventricle are all serious complications related to surgery [12–14].Although the reported incidence of LV thrombus which is most often seen in patients with MI has reduced significantly in the past decade with the advancement of new medications or intracardiac devices, early detection and treatment of LV thrombus in patients without past cardiac or thrombotic medical history may cause substantial variation in the reported mortality rates. Our patient had a giant LV thrombus, and his future potential risk for another systemic embolization was thought to be high. Therefore, prompt recognition and appropriate treatment of LV thrombus formation are essential to avoid deterioration of LV function and other severe complications in non-MI patients.Informed consent was obtained from the patient.The authors report no conflicts of interest regarding the content herein.The authors thank Ms. Marquez Megan and Dr. Hale Toklu for their assistance in proofreading the manuscript.
Successful Rotational Atherectomy for an Angulated Calcified Lesion in an Anomalous Right Coronary Artery Using the “Mother-and-Child” Technique
1Department of Cardiology, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, Izunokuni, Japan2Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Manabu Ogita; pj.en.ten-os.2as@atigo-mReceived 29 September 2017; Accepted 25 December 2017; Published 14 January 2018Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2018 Manabu Ogita et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) involving the anomalous coronary artery is challenging with respect to difficulty in achieving stable catheterization. Rotational atherectomy (RA) can facilitate severely calcified lesions to improve stent delivery and stent expansion; however, its utility in tortuous and angulated coronary arteries is limited with difficulty in delivery of the RA burr. The mother-and-child technique is effective for complex PCIs with increased backup force for device delivery in such complicated cases. We report a case of successful rotational atherectomy using the “mother-and-child” technique with a Dio thrombus aspiration catheter for an angulated calcified lesion in an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery.Coronary artery anomalies are a diverse group of congenital disorders that are found in 5% of the population [1]. Anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) accounts for 10% of all anomalous coronary artery cases [2]. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) involving the anomalous coronary artery is challenging with respect to selection of the guide catheter, insufficient backup force, and device delivery. The mother-and-child technique is useful for improving backup support and delivery of stents in such lesions [3]. Rotational atherectomy (RA) can facilitate lesion and stent expansion in severely calcified lesions especially in patients undergoing hemodialysis [4]; however, its utility is limited in tortuous and angulated coronary arteries, with an increased risk of vessel perforation and difficulty in delivery of the RA burr. We describe a case of successful rotational atherectomy for an angulated calcified lesion in the anomalous right coronary artery using the “mother-and-child” technique.A 46-year-old man with end-stage renal disease due to diabetic nephropathy was referred to our institution for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a severe calcified lesion in an anomalous right coronary artery. He had been undergoing hemodialysis three times a week for 3 years. Since patients with diabetic ESRD are at a high risk for coronary artery disease, coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) had been performed at his previous hospital visit, which revealed multivessel disease. Coronary angiography (CAG) showed severe stenosis in the midportion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and a chronic total occlusion (CTO) in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery with an anomalous origin. Hence, PCI of the LAD lesion was first performed, and a bioresorbable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent (Ultimaster 3.0 × 38 mm and 3.0 × 33 mm, TERUMO, Tokyo, Japan) was successfully implanted at the previous hospital. Staged PCI for CTO of the RCA was performed with successful wire crossing and recanalization. However, since subsequent standard balloon angioplasty was unsuccessful, he was referred to our hospital for PCI of the anomalous RCA.CAG demonstrated residual severely calcified stenosis in the proximal RCA with patent antegrade coronary flow (Figure 1). We selected right femoral access with a long sheath using a 7 Fr Amplatz left 2 guiding catheter (Asahi Intecc, Tokyo, Japan) in consideration of size up to a 2.0 mm burr. A SION blue wire (Asahi Intecc) was advanced into the distal RCA using a microcatheter (Caravel, Asahi Intecc) and intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS; OptiCross, Boston Scientific Corp., MA, USA). Based on the IVUS findings, which indicated severe circumferential calcification with a minimal luminal diameter larger than 1.25 mm, we decided to perform rotational atherectomy with a 1.5 mm burr (Boston Scientific Corp., MA, USA). For this, the first wire was exchanged for an extrasupport RotaWire (Boston Scientific) using the microcatheter. To obtain greater backup force, a Dio thrombus aspiration catheter (Goodman Co. Ltd., Aichi, Japan) was inserted into the RCA. The burr was successfully delivered to the anomalous RCA with dynaglide because we had difficulty advancing the burr manually. Halfway ablation with a 1.5 mm burr at 200,000 rpm was attempted several times, taking care not to advance the burr beyond the angle [5], although subsequent CAG and IVUS did not show the effective lesion modification after ablation. Then, we switched to balloon angioplasty with a 2.5 mm high-pressure balloon (NC Emerge 2.5 × 12 mm, Boston Scientific) and a 2.5 mm cutting balloon (Flextome 2.5 × 10 mm, Boston Scientific), but it was not enough to dilate the lesion. Finally, we switched back to rotational atherectomy and were subsequently able to pass the burr beyond the angulated calcified lesion without complications (Figure 2) and confirmed a crack using IVUS. Following effective dilation with a 3.0 mm high-pressure balloon (CELUSUS 3.0 × 8 mm, NIPRO, Osaka, Japan), we deployed a bioresorbable polymer everolimus-eluting stent (Synergy 2.5 × 24 mm, Boston Scientific) (Figure 3). The stent was additionally dilated with a noncompliance balloon (CELUSUS 3.0 × 8 mm, NIPRO, Osaka, Japan). A final coronary angiogram showed adequate and favorable dilatation of the culprit lesion (Figure 4).We report a case of successful rotational atherectomy for an angulated calcified lesion in an anomalous right coronary artery using the “mother-and-child” technique. PCI for the anomalous RCA can be associated with difficulty in achieving stable catheterization, leading to reduced backup support and device delivery failure. Rotational atherectomy (RA) can facilitate lesion and stent expansion in severely calcified lesions, although its utility is limited in tortuous and angulated coronary arteries, with an increased risk of complications. Appropriate guiding catheter selection is a key step to ensure successful PCI in such cases.The mother-and-child technique is effective for complex PCIs, as it increases the backup force through deep catheterization of the target vessel and facilitates device delivery in tortuous or calcified lesions. Several mother-and-child catheters have been introduced in clinical practice (Table 1). The GuideLiner catheter is a guide extension catheter with the monorail system which permits rapid exchange and now is, hence, increasingly used [6]. Only a few cases have been previously reported of use of the mother-and-child technique to deliver rotational atherectomy burrs. Vo et al. first reported the use of the GuideLiner catheter to deliver rotational atherectomy burrs in tortuous vessels [7]. Costanzo et al. also reported GuideLiner-facilitated rotational atherectomy in calcified right coronary arteries [8]. However, the mother-and-child technique for rotablation has not been well established. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of RA using the mother-and-child technique in an RCA with anomalous origin.In our case, we selected the conventional mother-child catheter, the 5 Fr Dio aspiration catheter for the following reasons. First, the 5 Fr Dio thrombus aspiration catheter has the RX-type inner catheter which facilitates smooth delivery and deep insertion of the outer catheter into the anomalous RCA. The relatively large inner lumen size of the outer catheter (1.51 mm) can provide the strong backup force for device delivery. Second, there is a concern that the rapid exchange transition zone of GuideLiner can lead to less backup support, difficulty in delivering the burr, and increase in the risk of burr entrapment. Thus, we thought that the Dio thrombus aspiration catheter can provide stronger backup support in our patient with rather complicated anatomy. Komatsu et al. reported successful PCI in an anomalous RCA using the Dio thrombus aspiration catheter [9]. This catheter allows not only stent delivery but also rotating burr delivery to severe calcified lesions in anomalous RCAs and can be a useful adjunctive device for rotational atherectomy. It is essential for operators to position the burr distal to the Dio thrombus aspiration catheter to prevent potential damage and shear of the child catheter. In summary, the “mother-and-child” technique is useful for rotational atherectomy in anomalous angulated RCAs. Rotablation with a Dio thrombus aspiration catheter is a potential therapeutic strategy in such complicated cases.We report a case of successful rotational atherectomy using the “mother-and-child” technique with a Dio thrombus aspiration catheter for an angulated calcified lesion in an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.The authors thank all the nurses and technicians of the cath lab in Juntendo Shizuoka Hospital for their professional contributions and assistance.
Multiple Culprit Coronary Artery Thrombosis in a Patient with Coronary Ectasia
Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, BrazilCorrespondence should be addressed to Bruno da Silva Matte; rb.ude.apch@ettambReceived 20 July 2017; Revised 4 November 2017; Accepted 26 November 2017; Published 14 January 2018Academic Editor: Manabu ShirotaniCopyright © 2018 Bruno da Silva Matte et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We here report a case of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to simultaneous acute coronary artery occlusions of two major coronary arteries in a patient with coronary ectasia. The patient had been previously submitted to percutaneous coronary angioplasty with bare metal stent implantation in both culprit vessels. Very late stent thrombosis could be the cause of the first occlusion, triggering the event in the other vessel. In addition, concomitant embolic sources were not identified. Although routine aspiration thrombectomy in STEMI was not proven to be beneficial in randomized clinical trials, it was of great value in this case. We also discuss the relation between coronary ectasia, chronic inflammatory status, and increased platelet activity which may have caused plaque disruption in another already vulnerable vessel.Multivessel acute thrombosis leading to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is rare, with a potentially devastating clinical presentation due to the vast myocardial area jeopardized [1]. Coronary artery ectasia (CAE) is characterized by abnormal dilatation of a localized or diffuse segment of epicardial coronary arteries, and its presence results in alterations in blood flow and stasis, predisposing to adverse coronary events [2]. On the one hand, current guidelines discourage routine thrombus aspiration techniques [3]. On the other hand, the performance of primary coronary angioplasty in the scenario of both high thrombotic burden and ectasic coronary artery may be facilitated by the adoption of aspirative thrombectomy approach. We present a case of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to simultaneous thrombotic occlusions of two major coronary arteries in a patient with coronary ectasia, successfully treated with thromboaspiration followed by bare metal stent (BMS) implantation and chronic anticoagulation.A 56-year-old male patient with a history of current tobacco use and previous coronary artery disease was admitted to the emergency room with acute coronary syndrome. He had previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) history in mid left anterior descendent (LAD) and proximal right coronary artery (RCA) with bare metal stents in a context of unstable angina two years before in another facility and was on aspirin 100 mg daily. Clopidogrel had been used for one year and then discontinued. He arrived at the hospital within five hours and thirty minutes from the onset of severe chest pain associated with nausea and diaphoresis. His blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate was 80 bpm, cardiac auscultation was unremarkable, and his Killip class was II.Admission ECG showed sinus rhythm with both anterior and inferior ST-segment elevation (Figure 1). Oral loading doses of antiplatelets (aspirin 300 mg and clopidogrel 600 mg) were administered, and coronary angiography was performed emergently. Surprisingly, thrombotic occlusions of both proximal RCA (Figure 2(a)) and mid LAD (Figure 2(b)) were disclosed. Unfractionated heparin (100 UI/kg) and IIb/IIIa glycoprotein inhibitor (abciximab) were administered during the procedure, and the latter was continued up to 12 hours after the procedure. Both vessels were diffusely ectasic, and the occlusions occurred into pronounced ectasic spots. LAD thrombosis occurred just proximal to the previously implanted stent, and RCA thrombosis occurred in the proximal segment while the previously implanted stent was on the distal segment. There were only discrete collaterals from LAD to RCA after the first vessel was recanalized.We decided to intervene first on LAD due to the larger myocardium area at risk. Guidewire easily surpassed the occluded segment, and LAD was predilated with 2.0 × 15 and 2.5 × 20 mm noncompliant balloons (NCB) without flow restoration despite several inflations. Manual thrombus aspiration with Export catheter was performed, and such approach allowed much better thrombus clearance and vessel delineation (Figure 2(d)). Kaname 3.0 × 28 mm BMS was then implanted and postdilated with a 3.5 × 15 mm NCB. RCA intervention was performed in the same procedure, and the vessel had a similar behavior, with easy guidewire navigation and no flow restoration with balloon angioplasty (2.5 × 20 mm and 3.0 × 20 mm). Manual aspiration also allowed better vessel delineation (Figure 2(c)). Multilink 4.0 × 33 mm and Prokinetic 4.0 × 20 mm BMS were implanted in distal and medial segments, respectively, with overlapping and was postdilated with a 5.0 × 20 mm NCB. Angiographic success (Figure 3) was achieved, and IIb/IIIa glycoprotein inhibitor was maintained for 12 hours in continuous infusion.The patient was in sinus rhythm throughout hospitalization, and echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 34% with apical and septal akinesia. It did not show intracardiac thrombus or vegetation, making coronary embolization improbable as a cause of thrombosis. Outpatient hematologic evaluation was scheduled to investigate for possible thrombophilia. After a successful in-hospital evolution, the patient was discharged asymptomatic within six days. Discharge medications were aspirin 100 mg, metoprolol 50 mg BID, enalapril 10 mg BID, simvastatin 40 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, and warfarin 5 mg. It was planned to use triple therapy for one month and then switch to dual therapy with clopidogrel and warfarin, indefinitely.Coronary artery ectasia (CAE) is characterized by abnormal dilatation of a localized or diffuse segment of the epicardial coronary arteries with a luminal diameter of at least 1.5-fold of normal adjacent segment or vessel diameter [4]. The incidence of CAE in patients investigated for coronary artery disease is between 1% and 2–5% [5]. It is caused by destruction of the vessel media and frequently coexists with coronary atherosclerosis. Even in the absence of obstructive disease, the presence of dilated coronary segments results in alterations in blood flow and stasis, predisposing to adverse coronary events like vasospasm, thrombosis, and dissection [4]. Recent study by Doi et al. showed higher incidence of major cardiac events, cardiovascular mortality, and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with CAE [6].ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction caused by multiple culprit coronary arteries is rare, with the largest series of cases reporting 47 patients with this condition [7]. Clinical presentation can be devastating because of the vast myocardial area jeopardized, with a high rate of harmful outcomes such as ventricular arrhythmia, severe heart failure, and cardiogenic shock [5]. There are several etiologies of multivessel coronary thrombosis, all of them related to the Virchow’s triad which include endothelial dysfunction, hemodynamic changes (i.e., stasis and turbulence), and hypercoagulability [7–9]. Factors probably involved with multiple coronary artery thrombosis in our patient include a proinflammatory state and blood turbulence caused by coronary ectasia, and heightened inflammatory response caused by the acute occlusion of the first vessel.There are some considerations regarding the management of our patient that needs to be highlighted: First, the choice of the first vessel to be treated was made on the larger myocardium supplied by LAD, and hemodynamic collapse could have occurred if RCA had been treated first due to large delay that would have happened because of complexity of the RCA PCI. It is intriguing that cardiogenic shock did not occur in this case, possibly because of collateral recruitment from the previous coronary events. Second, the combination of coronary ectasia and high thrombus burden, such as in our patient, illustrates a potential scenario of clinical benefit of aspiration thrombectomy. Third, IIb/IIIa glycoprotein inhibitor therapy promptly initiated when anatomy was defined by angiography probably was of great value. Fourth, bare metal stenting was performed aiming chronic anticoagulation, allowing the use of triple antiplatelet therapy for a shorter period and reducing the risk of bleeding. Taken all together, the anatomical and technical issues in this case were very enlightening.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Thrombosis in the Surgically Corrected Anomalous Right Coronary Artery after Reimplantation in Aorta
1Mid America Heart Institute, Saint Luke’s Hospital and University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, MO, USA2University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Ata Bajwa; ude.ckmu@aawjabReceived 14 March 2017; Revised 26 May 2017; Accepted 13 September 2017; Published 31 December 2017Academic Editor: Ramazan AkdemirCopyright © 2017 Ata Bajwa et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 32-year-old African American female presented with dyspnea, and after several cardiac diagnostic tests, the diagnosis of an anomalous origin of the RCA from the pulmonary trunk was established by multislice coronary CT angiography. She underwent surgical correction with reimplantation of the RCA, from the pulmonary artery to the aortic root. However, 10 days after surgery, she developed frequent episodes of chest pain, and repeat coronary CTA showed a partially occlusive thrombus in the surgically reimplanted RCA. Anticoagulation with warfarin resulted in complete resolution of the patient’s symptoms.Anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA) is a rare (0.002%) yet potentially life-threatening condition due to heart failure, coronary ischemia, or sudden cardiac death in infancy, adolescence, or adulthood due to fatal arrhythmia. Various imaging modalities are available to establish the diagnosis of this rare condition. Echocardiography might aid in the diagnosis, but magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) and multislice-gated coronary CT angiogram are more reliable modalities. Among the various surgically corrected techniques, reimplantation of the anomalous RCA to the aortic root is considered a preferred method. We present a case of recurrent chest pain after thrombosis of the surgically corrected ARCAPA with resolution of symptoms after systemic anticoagulation.A 32-year-old African American female, mother of seven healthy children, presented to our clinic for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion and chest heaviness of four-year duration. Her clinical exam was remarkable for a continuous murmur along the left sternal border. Echocardiogram was remarkable for an abnormal linear flow along the interventricular septum as shown in Figure 1 and Supplementary Video Clip 1. Coronary angiography demonstrated extremely dilated, diffusely ectatic, and tortuous left coronaries without any separate ostial RCA origin. Despite vigorous injection of X-ray contrast, rapid dilution occurred due to high flow in the left coronary system, as depicted in Supplementary Video Clip 2. On right heart catheterization, there was a step-up of oxygen saturation from 82% in the right ventricle to 87.5% in the pulmonary artery, raising suspicion of left-to-right shunt. The ventricular stroke volume was measured at 113 ml, and cardiac output was high at 11.1 L/min. Multislice-gated coronary CT angiogram revealed an anomalous origin of an extremely dilated and tortuous appearing right coronary artery (RCA) from the pulmonary trunk (Figure 2).The patient was offered surgical correction of ARCAPA but continued to defer it despite being symptomatic with frequent clinic visits. Two years later, she decided to schedule her surgery at an outside hospital and underwent reimplantation of the anomalous RCA into the aorta on 14 July 2015. Postoperatively, she initially felt better but developed sharp, substernal chest pain and shortness of breath 10 days later. She continued to have frequent emergency room visits and underwent testing including EKGs, troponins, and CT pulmonary angiogram of the chest, all of which were reported as unremarkable. Subsequently, she underwent a repeat coronary CT angiogram which showed that the RCA was surgically implanted in the anterior ascending aorta (Figures 3 and 4) and had a nonobstructing bulky thrombus in its proximal segment (Figures 5 and 6). She was started on oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and continued to follow-up in our clinic with improvement in her symptoms over the course of next few months.Anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA) is a rare yet potentially life-threatening condition [1]. In adults with ARCAPA, the RCA wall tends to be very thin and fragile and serves as a retrograde venous conduit from the left coronary circulation into the pulmonary artery [1, 2]. This anomalous connection results in a left-to-right shunt that explains both the step-up in oxygen saturation in the pulmonary artery and the high cardiac output seen in these cases, including our case [3]. Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a sister counterpart of ARCAPA and is relatively more commonly encountered. ALCAPA represents approximately 0.5% of congenital heart diseases compared to 0.002% by ARCAPA. Both of these anomalies can be encountered at any age but ALCAPA tends to become symptomatic early in life and is therefore more frequently diagnosed in infancy and childhood while ARCAPA is usually seen in adolescents and adults [4]. Unlike ARCAPA, physiology of ALCAPA results in significant myocardial ischemia due to inadequate perfusion pressure and low oxygen saturation from the pulmonary artery circulation. The ischemia develops early during infancy in most cases while others may present in early childhood or adulthood albeit with consequences of dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral regurgitation, malignant arrhythmias, and sometimes, even, sudden death [5].The clinical presentation of ARCAPA varies widely from heart failure and/or coronary ischemia [2, 6, 7]. Cases of sudden cardiac death in otherwise healthy individuals have also been reported, with some cases being described with coexistent coronary atherosclerosis [6, 8]. ARCAPA may be associated with other congenital and acquired heart diseases, including aortopulmonary window, truncus arteriosus, anomalous subclavian artery, tetralogy of Fallot, constrictive pericarditis, bicuspid aortic valve, and mitral regurgitation [7, 9–15].Advanced cardiac imaging modalities, magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), or multislice-gated coronary CT angiogram are the definitive diagnostic tests [8]. Multislice-gated coronary CT angiogram has become an increasingly popular test since it is noninvasive and cost-effective and provides accurate anatomical details for surgical correction [7, 8, 16].Surgical correction of ARCAPA is recommended even in asymptomatic patients with good overall outcomes [1, 3, 10, 12–14]. The most common surgical approach for this condition is to reimplant the anomalous RCA into the correct right aortic sinus. This approach was used in our patient. Another approach is complete ligation of the anomalous RCA proximally with insertion of a saphenous vein conduit from the aorta to the distal RCA, thus restoring normal antegrade coronary flow. “Takeuchi procedure,” occasionally performed in children, is a different surgical option in which an aortopulmonary window is created, and the flow between the anomalous right coronary ostium and the aorta is established using an intrapulmonary baffle or tunnel [15, 17, 18].Reimplanted coronary arteries appear to be more susceptible to thrombosis. We found two other cases where thrombosis of the corrected anomalous coronary artery was described after reimplantation procedure [19, 20]. Our case is a third example of such complication. The exact mechanism of thrombus formation is not clear, but plausible explanations are change from the high flow to the low flow coronary system after the surgical correction and loss of physiological arterial compliance. It is interesting to note that the thrombus was formed in the proximal part of the implanted anomalous coronary artery in our case as well as the case described by Han and colleagues [19]. Like other thrombotic conditions, warfarin therapy for 3–6 months is used for the treatment of this complication [19]. No data exist regarding the use of newer oral anticoagulant in these situations.In conclusion, anomalous right coronary artery from pulmonary artery is a rare congenital anomaly. Surgical correction is of low risk with long-term outcomes. However, thrombotic occlusion of reimplanted RCA should be considered in differential diagnosis. CT coronary angiography may be considered to help establish diagnosis in the early postoperative stage.All the authors report that there are no financial disclosures and no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.Video Clip 1: transthoracic echocardiogram. Parasternal long axis view revealed abnormal linear flow along the interventricular septum (yellow arrow). Video Clip 2: coronary angiography with ventriculogram. Left heart catheterization with ventriculogram showed large, diffusely ectatic, and tortuous coronary arteries (left anterior descending (yellow arrow), circumflex artery (red arrow)). Given the extremely dilated coronaries, it was not possible to clearly visualize coronary arteries even after injection of large amount of contrast dye into coronaries. (Supplementary Materials)
A Case of Cardiac Calcified Amorphous Tumor Presenting with Concomitant ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction and Occipital Stroke and a Brief Review of the Literature

It may mimic other cardiac tumors and can present with signs or symptoms of systemic embolization. There are limited data regarding CAT in the literature. We report a case of a 68-year-old woman with a cardiac CAT and mitral annular calcification (MAC), who presented with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and occipital stroke. After extensive review of the literature, we believe that this case is possibly the first description of a cardiac CAT presenting with STEMI. The CAT was surgically removed, and the diagnosis was confirmed by histology. The patient tolerated the surgery and reported no events at 6-month follow-up.Cardiac calcified amorphous tumor (CAT) is a rare benign intracavitary tumor of the heart. Like other cardiac tumors, CAT may present with dyspnea, syncope, and pulmonary or systemic embolization and obstruction [1–4]. Herein, we are reporting a case of CAT with mitral annular calcification, who presented with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and occipital stroke. To the best of our knowledge, our case perhaps is the first description of a cardiac CAT presenting with STEMI.A 68-year-old woman with a 40-pack-year smoking history but no known medical problem was brought in by ambulance for sudden onset of persistent, severe left-sided chest pain without radiation. The patient also reported a new onset of blurred vision. She denied history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), or chronic kidney disease or family history of premature CAD. Initial vital signs were normal with oxygen saturation of 98% on 2-liter supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Physical examination was benign, without murmur or abnormal heart sounds. There were no focal neurological deficits or signs of peripheral embolization noted. Initial electrocardiogram (EKG) showed 1-2 mm ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) with reciprocal ST depression in leads I and aVL (Figure 1). Oral aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin were given immediately. Intravenous heparin was also initiated. Emergent coronary angiography showed an occlusion in one of the acute marginal branches of the right coronary artery and slow flow in the posterior descending artery. There was no other significant CAD (Figure 2). Left ventricular wall motion and systolic function were normal. Subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a 1.2 × 1.2 cm mobile mass attached to the base of the posterior mitral valve leaflet on ventricular aspect (Figure 3). Of note, the mitral annulus also appeared rather echogenic. No thrombus was noted in left atrium or left ventricle during TTE or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Troponin I was 1.7 ng/ml on arrival. It increased to 26 ng/ml 10 hours later. Her workups, including complete blood count, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, calcium, creatinine, liver function test, lipid panel, and hemoglobin A1c, were all normal. CT scan of the brain without contrast showed an infarct in the left occipital lobe (Figure 4). Cardiothoracic surgery was performed. A 1.2 × 0.9 × 0.2 cm tan-pink-colored soft tissue mass was surgically removed without any complications. Histologic examination of the mass showed a nodule of amorphous debris and fibrinous material with histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without organism, consistent with a cardiac CAT (Figure 5). Throughout the hospital stay, she was closely monitored in coronary care unit and subsequently on telemetry floor. No atrial arrhythmia was reported.The patient recovered well without recurrent symptoms at her 6-month follow-up.First introduced by Reynolds et al. in 1997, cardiac CAT is an extremely rare nonneoplastic primary tumor of the heart. It is characterized histologically by the features of calcified nodules and amorphous fibrinous materials [1]. CAT is usually discovered by cardiac imaging studies, but the definite diagnosis requires histological study of the tumor. ElBardissi et al. reported that the lifetime incidence of primary cardiac tumors (benign or malignant) was 0.02% based on 48 years of data collection, and only 8 of 323 cases (2.47%) of primary cardiac tumors were CAT [5]. There have so far been limited data on pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis of CAT. The majority of CAT is seen in association with valvular heart disease (31%), end-stage renal disease (21%), mitral annular calcification (MAC) (14%), or diabetes mellitus (14%) [2]. Of interest, the MAC-related CAT tends to be highly mobile and more likely to embolize [6]. To date, there have been 13 reported cases of MAC-related CAT [6–11]. Most of them (9 cases) are associated with ESRD. MAC, a chronic fibrous degeneration of the mitral valve, is reportedly caused by abnormalities of calcium-phosphorus (Ca-PO4) metabolism [7–9, 12]. MAC has been reported to increase the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular diseases but has not been linked to increased risk of myocardial infarction [13]. MAC is usually diagnosed based on hyperechoic mitral annulus on TTE. Our patient has normal renal function and serum calcium level. The echo densities of the tumor and mitral annulus in our patient are quite similar, suggesting the presence of MAC-like appearance on TTE. We felt that the MAC-like appearance on TTE in our patient and other reported cases without associated ESRD may have resulted from tumor infiltration into mitral valve annulus rather than from the conventional MAC process due to abnormal Ca-PO4 metabolism. However, more studies are required to determine the exact underlying mechanism. Unfortunately, as in most patients who underwent surgical resection of the CAT, only the tumor was removed and biopsy of the mitral annulus was not performed in our patient. Surgical resection of the tumor is generally recommended to prevent embolization in most patients [6, 8–10, 14]. Our patient presented with concomitant blurred vision and STEMI, most likely due to the embolic phenomenon from the cardiac CAT.The patient did not have any evidence of atrial arrhythmias on telemetry monitoring or intracardiac thrombus in TTE or TEE. Additionally, coronary angiogram showed isolated lesions at the third acute marginal branch and PDA of RCA and otherwise nonobstructive coronaries. Carotid ultrasound also showed normal bilateral vertebral and subclavian arteries, but there were mild stenoses (<50%) of bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICAs). Mild ICA stenoses could not explain the left occipital stroke as well. The occluded acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery was <1.5 mm in diameter angiographically. Therefore, no coronary intervention or aspiration was performed. The prognosis is generally good after complete removal of the mass lesion [15, 16]. The only recurrence was reported in a patient who received incomplete resection of the tumor [17]. Our patient tolerated the surgical procedure and has done well without any recurrent events at the six-month follow-up.CAT of the heart is rare. Despite its benign nature, it can be highly mobile and consequently lead to systemic embolization, particularly in those with associated MAC. The prognosis is excellent with surgical resection in most patients. For those without ESRD or abnormal calcium metabolism, further studies may help determine whether cardiac CAT can involve the mitral annulus and result in an appearance similar to MAC on TTE.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Anomalous Coronary Artery Origin in a Young Patient with Marfan Syndrome

Aortic aneurysm is its main complication, and along the dilation of the aorta root and its descending portion (60–100%), with secondary aortic insufficiency, it increases risk of acute aortic dissection and death. Coronary artery anomalies affect between 0.3% and 1.6% of the general population and are the second leading cause of sudden death in young adults, especially if the anomalous coronary passes through aorta and pulmonary artery. The anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery in the right Valsalva sinus has a prevalence of 0.02%–0.05% and is commonly related to other congenital cardiac anomalies, such as transposition of great vessels, coronary fistulas, bicuspid aortic valve, and tetralogy of Fallot. Its association with Marfan syndrome is not known, and there is no previous report in the literature. We describe here a case of a female with Marfan syndrome diagnosed with symptomatic anomalous origin of the left coronary artery in the right Valsalva sinus.Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that affects connective tissue and is caused by mutations in the fibrillin 1 gene present at chromosome 15. It compromises mainly skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems, besides skin, central nervous system, and lungs [1–3]. Clinical presentation is characterized by higher height, disproportion between upper and lower limbs (dolichostenomelia), anterior thoracic deformity (pectus excavatum or carinatum), aortic arch dilatation, aortic insufficiency, mitral valve prolapse with associated regurgitation, and many other anomalies [1–4]. Diagnosis is made by the presence of family history and evaluation of the characteristic manifestations through the “Revised Ghent-2 Nosology” [5, 6]. The treatment is based on a multidisciplinary approach, with an emphasis on cardiovascular complications.Coronary artery anomalies (CAAs) affect between 0.3% and 1.6% of the general population [7] and are the second leading cause of sudden death in young adults, especially if the anomalous coronary origins between the aorta and the pulmonary artery [8]. There are several types of CAAs, which may be asymptomatic or manifest through myocardial ischemia, such as chest pain, dyspnea, and arrhythmias, especially to the efforts [8]. The anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery in the right Valsalva sinus has a prevalence of 0.02% to 0.05% [9] and is commonly related to other congenital cardiac anomalies, such as transposition of large vessels, coronary fistulas, aortic valve bicuspid, and tetralogy of Fallot [10]. There is no previous report in the literature about its association with Marfan syndrome. We describe here a case of a female with Marfan syndrome, who was diagnosed with symptomatic anomalous origin of the left coronary artery in the right Valsalva sinus.A 22-year-old female, Jehovah’s witness, presented with frequent palpitations and atypical chest pain at rest and during exertion for seven years, associated with respiratory distress at moderate exertion and sporadic lower limb edema, without other symptoms. She was given atenolol 50 mg once daily as a result of palpitations, and she was a carrier of Marfan syndrome, diagnosed in childhood, without reports of previous complications related to the disease. The diagnostic criteria of Marfan syndrome, based on revised Ghent-2 nosology, was ectopia lentis and systemic score ≥ 7 points in a patient with positive family history. No history of smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. She presented with typical Marfan syndrome alterations in ectoscopy (pectus carinatum deformity, hindfoot deformity, wrist and thumb signs, scoliosis or thoracolumbar kyphosis, dolichocephaly, enophthalmos, downslanting palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, and skin striae), and examination of the cardiovascular system was completely normal. Biochemical analysis was performed (hemoglobin: 15.3 g/dL, leukocytes: 6.510 cells/mm3, platelets: 245.000 cells/mm3, creatinine: 0.74 mg/dL, urea: 19 mg/dL, total cholesterol: 239 mg/dL (HDL: 88 mg/dL and LDL: 125 mg/dL), triglycerides: 131 mg/dL, and fasting glucose: 82 mg/dL). Electrocardiogram was normal. Exercise stress testing by the Ellestad protocol resulted in one paired ventricular premature ventricular beats, a long period of ventricular bigeminism, and absence of significant ST segment changes. The 24-hour Holter demonstrated sinus rhythm, 5.605 ventricular premature beats (<6%) with frequent bigeminism, and 16 supraventricular (<1%) premature beats, with no other changes. Echocardiogram and magnetic resonance of the heart depicted mitral valve prolapse with mild regurgitation and no other changes. Computed Tomography (CT) coronary angiography revealed the left main coronary artery with anomalous origin from the right coronary Valsalva sinus and an initial pathway between the aorta and pulmonary arteries, where there was significant luminal reduction (close to 50%) at rest, absence of atherosclerosis or luminal reduction in the other coronary arteries, and total calcium score of zero (Figure 1). After meticulous CT coronary angiography analysis, it was not possible to define intramural coronary pathway existence and there was no intravascular ultrasonography available to improve diagnostic accuracy. Coronary angiography confirmed an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery, with exit from the right coronary sinus without obstructive lesions (Figure 2). Sesta-MIBI perfusion scintigraphy demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction of 61% at rest, and 57% poststress, discrete anterior wall perfusion defect (apical segment), and mild transient perfusion defect in the middle and basal segments of the anterior wall and the segment of the anterolateral wall (Figure 3). No aortic dilation was observed in CT aortic angiography.After a correlation between symptoms and the presence of myocardial ischemia, the Heart Team approach decided for elective surgical treatment. Although the patient was young and did not have atherosclerotic coronary disease, the surgical group preferred to make coronary arterial bypass grafting (left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery) instead of coronary unroofing or reimplantation because of the service experience and undefinition of intramural pathway existence. The procedure occurred without complications, and the patient has been followed-up asymptomatically for 6 months.Aortic aneurysm is the main complication of Marfan syndrome. Dilation of the aorta root and its descending portion (60–100%), with secondary aortic insufficiency, increases risk of acute aortic dissection and death. Aburawi and O’Sullivan described that aortic root dilatation develops early in MFS and was present in 35% by the age of 5 years, 68% by 19 years, and at least 80% by 40 years [11]. Other cardiac complications are less common in Marfan syndrome [12–20].Coronary artery anomalies, although present in other syndromic pathologies, are not described in Marfan syndrome. As discussed above, its importance is related to the risk of sudden death and to events related to myocardial ischemia when the anomalous coronary pathway goes between the aorta and the main pulmonary artery, mainly if it is intramural. In addition to the compressive effect of the great vessels due to their anatomical changes by the effort, other mechanisms precipitating ischemia seem to be involved, such as intramural pathway, angulation in the artery pathway of anomalous implantation, endothelial lesion with consequent vasospasm, and higher incidence of atherosclerotic disease in this type of vessel [9, 21–25].The anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery in the right Valsalva sinus can be classified into 4 types, based on its path: (a) pathway between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk, (b) pathway anterior to the exit of the right ventricle, (c) pathway through the supraventricular intramyocardial or subendocardial ridge, and (d) posterior pathway to the aortic root [23].The treatment can be medical or surgical, and it depends on the age, existence of associated coronary artery disease, presence of clinical signs suggestive of myocardial ischemia and/or positive ischemic evaluation tests, presence of intramural coronary segment, and the experience of the service [6]. According to the 2008 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines, surgical treatment is indicated in patients with any of the following: anomalous left main coronary artery coursing between the great arteries and documented coronary ischemia secondary to coronary artery compression when the artery courses between the aorta and the pulmonary artery or intramurally [26]. In regard to the ischemic tests, their sensitivity for the prediction of sudden death is unknown. Moreover, the intense physical exertion that results in sudden cardiac death is not achieved with these tests, so its hemodynamic effects are difficult to analyse. The intravascular ultrasonography has been used successfully to evaluate the dynamic aspects of the anomalous coronary intramural segment, which may help to decide the ideal treatment option [24, 26, 27]. There are three main modalities of surgical treatment, and the best choice depends on the patient’s characteristics. Coronary unroofing is indicated when there is intramural coronary segment. Coronary arterial bypass grafting is indicated mainly in older patients, who have no longer life expectancies than their bypass grafts, and those with coronary atherosclerotic artery disease. Reimplantation involves transferring the coronary ostium to the appropriate sinus, but forming coronary buttons and reimplanting at an appropriate angle can be technically challenging [6, 28–30]. In our case report, there was no intravascular ultrasonography available, and the Heart Team decided on coronary arterial bypass grafting (left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery). It occurred because of the service experience and undefinition of intramural pathway existence.The case reported here describes a patient with MFS and anomalous coronary artery origin who developed clinical and laboratorial signs of coronary ischemia. The approach of these patients is very controversial; however, due to the possibility of sudden death related to the efforts, among other cardiac complications, surgical treatment was indicated. So, this rare condition of coronary anomaly is possible and must be considered in association with Marfan syndrome as described here.There are no conflicts of interest among the authors involved in the composition and submission of this case report.
Ticagrelor-Induced Angioedema: A Rare and Unexpected Phenomenon
1University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago2North West Regional Health Authority, Mt. Hope, Trinidad and Tobago3Advanced Cardiovascular Institute, Port of Spain, Trinidad and TobagoCorrespondence should be addressed to Naveen Anand Seecheran; moc.liamg@narehceesnReceived 12 October 2017; Accepted 23 November 2017; Published 17 December 2017Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2017 Rajeev Seecheran et al.

This case report describes an exceedingly rare episode of ticagrelor-induced hypersensitivity reaction, manifesting as angioedema with periorbital and likely respiratory involvement. The heart team should be vigilant for this precarious condition which may require emergent airway management. Desensitization protocols and alternative regimens (e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel, and addition of an adjunctive anticoagulant) should be considered when there is an absolute indication for antiplatelet therapy.The benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was established by several pivotal trials [1–3]. DAPT with clopidogrel reduced the 1-year incidence of cardiovascular events by approximately 20% compared with aspirin monotherapy. Subsequently, more potent and consistent P2Y12 receptor inhibition with either prasugrel or ticagrelor was superior to clopidogrel in the respective TRITON [4] and PLATO [5] trials.Clopidogrel has become a mainstay of treatment of patients with ACS to reduce ischemic complications after percutaneous coronary interventions. Prasugrel, with its more potent effect, is the immediate successor to clopidogrel. The newest member of the P2Y12 inhibitors is ticagrelor, which is not a thienopyridine and, however, demonstrates a superior pharmacological profile than clopidogrel. In contrast to clopidogrel and prasugrel, it does not require metabolic activation and binds reversibly to the P2Y12 receptor [6].As the use of clopidogrel has proliferated, hypersensitivity reactions have been increasingly recognized [7]. Generally, allergic reactions are frequent with antiplatelet drugs with aspirin being the chief culprit, with a prevalence of 1.5%. Hypersensitivity reactions occur in 6% of patients with clopidogrel [8]. There are case reports which identify allergic reactions with ticagrelor; however, the exact prevalence cannot be ascertained [9].ACS patients receiving DAPT should be closely monitored for adverse drug reactions (ADRs). While clinical trials provide valuable information about common ADRs, it is crucial that rarer events are reported into pharmacovigilance databases that can be accessed by healthcare providers and patients alike [10].A 69-year-old African gentleman with a medical history of coronary artery disease after percutaneous coronary intervention to his right coronary artery in 2014 for a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and prior contrast-media allergy presented to the emergency department with atypical angina.Shortly after his arrival, he was seen by the emergency medicine physician who initiated an acute coronary syndrome antiplatelet regimen comprising both oral aspirin 325 mg and ticagrelor 180 mg. Vital signs revealed mild hypertension with a blood pressure of 147/94 mmHg, normal pulse rate of 74 beats per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on pulse oximetry on room air. His physical examination was significant for left-sided chest wall tenderness only. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed sinus rhythm with a 1st degree atrioventricular block and a left anterior fascicular block with prior inferior myocardial infarction. There were no acute ischemic changes. His cardiac biomarkers were normal (peak serum levels of creatine phosphokinase-MB fraction (CK-MB) and troponin T were 1.5 ng mL−1 (normal range, 1–5 ng mL−1) and 0.034 ng mL−1 (normal range, 0-0.1 ng mL−1), respectively) and did not reflect a myocardial infarction.Approximately 1 hour after ticagrelor administration, the patient reported a constellation of symptoms which included worsening chest pain, sudden-onset respiratory distress, and generalized urticaria. His repeat physical examination revealed new-onset periorbital edema and angioedema (Figure 1). He was immediately administered 200 mg intravenous hydrocortisone, 100 mg intravenous ranitidine, and 10 mg intravenous chlorphenamine with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium, and his symptoms resolved shortly thereafter (within an hour).Based on the clinical scenario, the patient’s tentative diagnosis was ticagrelor-induced hypersensitivity reaction with angioedema as this was the only new medication he was given (he was on daily maintenance aspirin for his CAD and previously tolerated a 1-year course of clopidogrel after drug-eluting stent implantation). It was also noted that he was not on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. He was subsequently transferred to cardiac care unit for further observation and supportive care. The following day, a 2D transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% without regional wall motion abnormalities. He reported that his symptoms were much improved and was hemodynamically stable. His clinical angioedema completely resolved. The patient’s atypical angina completely abated, and subsequent cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiograms were unremarkable. As a result, inpatient coronary angiography was not pursued as his TIMI risk stratification was considered low to moderate risk, and outpatient exercise stress echocardiography was the preferred management strategy to assess for ischemia. He was safely discharged on guideline-recommended, optimal medical therapy comprising aspirin, clopidogrel (which he previously tolerated as DAPT for his prior stent implantation without any adverse effects), beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with high-intensity statin, and a tapered course of oral steroid therapy.Acquired angioedema (AAE) can be immunologic, nonimmunologic, or idiopathic [11]. It is generally characterized by repetitive episodes of swelling, and if it occurs in the upper respiratory tract, it can be imminently life-threatening [12, 13]. The pathophysiology is ascribed to the accumulation of bradykinin [13]. Angiotensin enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are common agents which can elicit this condition; however, our patient’s medical regimen did not comprise either. The estimated incidence of drug-induced angioedema is reported to be less than 1% [14].In this case, ticagrelor, a cyclopentyl-triazolopyrimidine with a similar structure to adenosine, was administered in combination with aspirin. Periorbital edema was evident within an hour of administration and, thus, appeared to be temporally linked (Figure 1). Laryngeal and respiratory involvement were immediately considered with the onset of the patient’s dyspnea. Histamine antagonists (both H1 and H2) and intravenous steroids are the mainstays of treatment, and in severe cases (e.g., airway obstruction or anaphylaxis), epinephrine may be warranted [14]. The goals of emergency treatment of angioedema are to prevent spontaneous eruption, to maintain a patent airway if eruption does occur, and to stop progression of disease [11]. As laryngeal edema progresses rapidly, stridor of the airway occurs with resultant hypoxia. Tracheal intubation is required in these situations to prevent respiratory arrest and risk of death. In these cases, a definitive airway such as an endotracheal tube should be established. If the airway cannot be effectively secured with an endotracheal tube, a surgical airway is indicated, usually in the form of an emergency cricothyrotomy [12].Another important aspect to consider is that the patient had a previous allergic reaction to contrast media with urticaria during his prior percutaneous coronary intervention. In general, patients with unrelated allergies are at a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of an allergic-like contrast reaction, and this suggests that ticagrelor was the likely culprit for precipitating the angioedema given his background [15].While ticagrelor is a recognized cause of angioedema, the literature is not replete with case reports or series describing the role of ticagrelor in angioedema. Clopidogrel, an oral thienopyridine prodrug, is generally well tolerated, but 1.5% of patients eventually require drug discontinuation [16]. Prasugrel, also a thienopyridine prodrug, is known to have caused similar immediate-type allergic reactions including angioedema, but the prevalence appears to be less frequent [17]. There are few reported cases of cross-reactivity between prasugrel and ticagrelor; however, the presence of cross-reactivity between clopidogrel and prasugrel appears to not be infrequent [18].With respect to the clinical scenario warranting dual antiplatelet therapy for a protracted period, several therapeutic options can be considered. Cheema et al. [16] investigated patients with suspected hypersensitivity reactions to clopidogrel manifesting with facial angioedema, and the vast majority was able to continue treatment and experienced a resolution of symptoms under short-term systemic corticosteroids [19]. Another strategy is drug desensitization, which has proved to be successful in several specific cases and, in small case series, can be attempted in complex cases where there is an absolute indication for a P2Y12 inhibitor [8]. The conventional approach for a persistent reaction has been to substitute with alternative therapies [16, 19]. He was not subsequently challenged with either clopidogrel (which he previously tolerated without issue) or prasugrel, as he did not have a definitive myocardial infarction.In summary, we describe a case report of ticagrelor-induced angioedema occurring within 1 hour after administration. The heart team should be vigilant for angioedema as an adverse drug reaction which can precipitate respiratory distress requiring emergent airway management. Desensitization protocols and alternative regimens (e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel, and addition of an adjunctive anticoagulant) should be considered when there is the absolute indication for antiplatelet therapy.Ticagrelor can abruptly induce angioedema which may cause life-threatening airway obstruction requiring emergent airway management. Desensitization protocols and alternative regimens should be considered when there is an absolute indication for antiplatelet therapy.All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest and there are no financial disclosures.Rajeev Seecheran, Valmiki Seecheran, Sangeeta Persad, Sasha Lalla, and Naveen Anand Seecheran all contributed equally in writing the manuscript.

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We report the case of an anomalous circumflex (Cx) origin from the right sinus of Valsalva with retroaortic course observed in a modified apical four-chamber view during transthoracic study (TTE). This finding is known as the “crossed aorta sign.” Usually, the diagnosis of this congenital anomaly of coronary circulation is established during coronary angiography. In this case, the diagnosis was performed by echocardiography before angiography. We believe that recent improvements in echocardiography increase the potential of this imaging technology also in the diagnosis of coronary artery anomalies.The coronary artery anomalies can be classified as abnormalities of origin, course, and termination [1]. These congenital anomalies can affect all coronary arteries. In adult patients, the prognosis of coronary artery anomalies is mainly determined by the arterial course to aorta and pulmonary arteries and may be associated with clinical scenarios, such as congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, syncope, and sudden death [2]. Here, we reported a case of coronary anatomic variation of the left circumflex artery originating from the right sinus of Valsalva.We report the case of a 45-year-old Caucasian man with a medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia and a family history of ischemic heart disease, who was admitted to our acute coronary care unit with diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient has given his informed consent for participation in the research study. The twelve-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, widespread T-wave inversion in anterior-lateral leads. The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a normal left ventricle (LV) ejection fraction (55%), with limited apical wall motion abnormality. Furthermore, on the basis of a “crossed aorta sign,” we suspected the anomalous circumflex (Cx) coronary artery with probable origin from the right sinus of Valsalva (Figure 1) [3]. In a five-chamber apical view, Cx seemed to cross the aorta perpendicularly to aortic long axis, suggesting retroaortic course (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)), as previously described by Wierzbowska and colleagues. The authors also described the “bleb sign”: the cross section of retroaortically coursing Cx, forming a particular sign in mitroaortic angle in the transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) long-axis aortic view. This is a new type of echocardiographic sign, which can help to detect the retroaortic coursing of Cx. In our case, the use of the TEE technic was not necessary, since the abnormal course of the Cx was already well detectable by transthoracic echocardiography [3]. During angiography, the anomalous Cx origin from the right sinus was confirmed (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Anyway, the patient underwent successful stenting of the anterior descending artery, the culprit vessel. The coronary artery anomalies are classified into abnormalities of origin, distribution, and termination. The anomalous left Cx may arise from a separate ostium within the right sinus, or very unusually as a proximal branch of the right coronary artery with the approximate incidence of 0.37 to 0.7% in all patients [2, 4].Congenital anomalies of coronary arteries are detected in about 1% in patients undergoing coronary angiography. In the specific case of the anomalous left circumflex artery, it may originate from a separate ostium within the right sinus, or as a proximal branch of the right coronary artery with the approximate incidence of 0.37 to 0.7% in all patients [2, 4]. In these cases, it usually courses inferiorly and posteriorly to the aorta to enter the left atrioventricular groove. Usually, the diagnosis of this congenital anomaly of coronary circulation is established during coronary angiography, and stent implantation generally facilitates an echocardiographic view of the vessel course. In our case, the diagnosis was performed by echocardiography, before angiography, detecting “crossed aorta sign” [3], a novel echocardiographic sign, in an apical five-chamber view in which Cx seemed to cross the aorta perpendicularly to aortic long axis. At echocardiographic exam, the “crossed aorta sign” can be confused with the course of the coronary sinus. However, considering the coronary anatomy, the coronary sinus course is usually posterior to the anomalous circumflex course so that the coronary sinus is more easily visualized through the four-chamber apical view, while “crossed aorta sign” can be showed better in the five-chamber apical view, or in a modified four-chamber apical view. In addition, a feature that differentiates the two echographic anatomical structures is the thickness of the vessel wall: the circumflex has thicker walls than the coronary sinus. In most cases, the anomalous origin of Cx is a benign anomaly. Its detection by transthoracic echocardiogram can help cardiologists to prevent clinical complications. In adult patients, the prognosis of coronary artery anomalies, considering a higher vulnerability to atherosclerosis, is mainly determined by the relationship between arterial pathways, aorta, and pulmonary arteries. These coronary anomalies may be associated with congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, syncope, and sudden death [2].Usually, the diagnosis of this congenital anomaly of coronary circulation is established during coronary angiography, and stent implantation generally facilitates an echocardiographic view of the vessel course. Usually, the coronary stents facilitate the visualization of the vessel course, allowing the observation of a novel echocardiographic sign in an apical five-chamber view. This is due to the fact that implanted stents make the anomalous Cx hyperechogenic and easier to be noticed at echocardiography. Our case is particular, since Cx coursing detection was found before stent implantation [3]. In our case, the diagnosis was performed by echocardiography, before angiography, detecting “crossed aorta sign” [3], a novel echocardiographic sign, in an apical five-chamber view in which Cx seemed to cross the aorta perpendicularly to aortic long axis. We believe that the development of echocardiographic technologies will increase the potential role of echo also in the diagnosis of coronary artery anomalies and other pathological entities that were previously misdiagnosed.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Rare Case of Cocaine-Induced Aortic Aneurysm: A Near Dissection Event
Department of Internal Medicine, MacNeal Hospital, Berwyn, IL, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Ranju Kunwor; moc.liamg@rownukujnarReceived 10 June 2017; Revised 6 August 2017; Accepted 10 October 2017; Published 14 December 2017Academic Editor: Christopher S. SnyderCopyright © 2017 Ranju Kunwor and AnnMarie Canelas. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Cocaine use has been associated with cardiovascular complications such as coronary atherosclerosis, coronary artery spasm, cardiac arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathies. Aortic dissection is a rare but life-threatening complication of cocaine use. Cocaine and stimulant use can cause aortic aneurysm by increasing the aortic wall stress, and the most feared complications are dissection, rupture, and death. There are no clear guidelines about screening cocaine abusers with CT scan of the chest. We do not know if the number of years of cocaine use or the amount of cocaine use can be associated with higher incidence of aortic aneurysm or dissection. Cocaine-induced aortic aneurysm does not have any specific clinical feature. Common presentation is chest discomfort or chest pain. This common presentation is bewildering enough for clinicians to think of more common causes of chest pain like myocardial infarction and myocarditis. The sudden onset of severe, sharp, stabbing chest or back pain is suggestive of aortic dissection. Here, we present a young otherwise healthy patient with chronic cocaine use presenting with chest pain and found to have significant size aortic aneurysm.Thoracic aortic aneurysm occurs due to increased aortic wall stress from hypertension and less commonly due to genetic and inflammatory condition or prior cardiac surgery [1]. The most feared complication is dissection [1, 2]. In the general population, aortic dissection occurs in 2.6–3.5 per 100,000 patient years [3]. In a study, 921 cases of acute aortic dissection presenting to IRAD (International Registry for Aortic Dissection) centers from 1996 through 2000 were studied, and only 5 (0.5%) cases were associated with cocaine use ( value 0.068). Cocaine seemed to have played a significant role in precipitating aortic dissection among young cohort (age 44.4 ± 3.9 years,  value < 0.001) [4]. This IRAD study suggested that cocaine is not likely to be responsible for >1% of aortic dissections.A 41-year-old white male with no significant past medical history presented in the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. The patient was having chest discomfort for one day. On the day of presentation, he had severe 10/10 intensity, central chest pain, aggravated with lying down and relieved with sitting up. He had associated dyspnea but denied fever, cough, presyncope, syncope, or palpitations. He denied any similar history in the past. There were no known heart murmurs. There was no history of sudden cardiac death or heart disease in family. He snorted cocaine every two weeks for several years, and the last use was a night before his symptoms started. He admitted to drinking alcohol in weekends but denied tobacco smoking.His vital signs in the ED was significant for tachycardia, heart rate 110 beats/minute. Initial BP (blood pressure) in ED was 136/83 mmHg. On exam, he had blowing, decrescendo, grade II/VI diastolic murmur heard best in the third left intercostal space, and grade III/VI holosystolic murmur on the left sternal border. He had crackles at lung base but no pedal edema or jugular venous distension on exam.EKG showed ST elevation suggestive of anterior and inferior infarct (Figure 1). Serial troponins three times were normal. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly. The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit with presumptive diagnosis of pericarditis versus cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed for the concern of diastolic murmur and pericarditis. TTE showed 6.2 cm aortic root dilatation and severe AR (aortic regurgitation) with possible aortic dissection, EF 50%, and minimal MR (mitral regurgitation) and TR (tricuspid regurgitation). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient’s systolic BP increased to the range of 150–160 mmHg. He was started on labetalol for better BP control. CT chest showed 6 cm aneurysm of the aortic root and ascending aorta and aneurysm of the aortic arch 3.6 cm, without dissection (Figure 2). The patient was taken to the operating room (OR) for emergent surgical repair and aortic valve replacement. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was done in the OR. TEE finding was consistent with 6.2 cm aneurysm, moderate to severe AR but no dissection (Figure 3). The aortic valve was trileaflet. Emergency repair of ascending aortic aneurysm using a Hemashield graft, and aortic valve replacement using a mechanical prosthesis, with repair of the sinus of Valsalva aneurysm was performed.Biopsy results/pathology showed the aortic valve with degenerative changes but no cystic medial degeneration. Aortic tissue comprised large vessel walls, with hemorrhage and foci of acute and chronic inflammation. This is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in hypertensive aortic aneurysm and/or dissection. Cocaine can cause profound sympathetic stimulation and hypertension that presumably causes sheer stress on the aorta’s intima that a small “Nick” or tear occurs which explains the hemorrhage in the pathology.Blood cultures were negative. ANA panel was done for the concern of vasculitis and was negative. Marfan’s gene was not tested given the pathology finding, absent Marfanoid clinical features, and negative family history. Postsurgical TTE shows prosthetic aortic valve, with no evidence of aortic regurgitation. EF 50%. Minimal MR. Mild TR. Postoperatively, he was started on heparin bridge to warfarin for anticoagulation. Because the patient had borderline low EF of 50% pre- and postoperatively, the cardiologist recommended starting the patient on metoprolol, furosemide, and lisinopril. The patient was discharged to home on postoperative day number 5.This case illustrates that cocaine can be a predisposing factor for aortic aneurysm and/or dissection in otherwise healthy, young, and not genetically predisposed person [5]. Our patient had trileaflet aortic valve, negative family history, and no medial degeneration (previously designated cystic medial necrosis) in the pathology, thus making the congenital process less likely. There was no trauma or hypertension history. We did not think of doing CT at the initial presentation in this patient. ACC/AHA guideline does mention cocaine as a risk factor for thoracic aneurysm, but it does not have screening guidelines in cocaine abusers [6]. The question is, is it worth doing CT chest in every cocaine abuser presenting with chest pain? No clear answer to this question exists, but there is a high suspicion for etiology, considering CT in appropriate patients is reasonable. Although cocaine is a rare cause of this life-threatening and rare diagnosis [3], astute suspicion will help prevent a fatal consequence [1, 7].This case was presented as a poster in the American College of Physician (ACP) National Meeting 2017, as the Resident/Fellows poster finalist for National Abstract Competition 2017.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
ST Segment Elevation Is Not Always Myocardial Infarction: A Case of Focal Myopericarditis
1Internal Medicine Department, University of Kansas Medical School, Wichita, KS, USA2Radiology Department, University of Kansas Medical School, Wichita, KS, USA3Heartland Cardiology, Wichita, KS, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Cyrus M. Munguti; ude.cmuk@itugnumcReceived 4 July 2017; Revised 2 August 2017; Accepted 5 September 2017; Published 29 November 2017Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2017 Cyrus M. Munguti et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Protocols exist on how to manage STEMI patients, with well-established timelines. There are times when patients present with chest pain, ST segment elevation, and biomarker elevation that are not due to coronary artery disease. These conditions usually present with normal coronary angiography. We present a case that was clinically indistinguishable from STEMI and that was diagnosed with focal myopericarditis on cardiac MRI.Typical chest pain with elevated ST segment elevation on electrocardiogram (EKG) is a medical emergency, with well-drilled protocols and timeline targets [1]. There are times when the ST elevation is not due to coronary obstruction but a mimic. Inflammation associated with myopericarditis can produce chest pain and EKG changes that may be clinically indistinguishable from a coronary event. Myalgia, fatigue, pleuritic chest pain, and fever are common presentations associated with viral illness, but the absence of this history does not preclude post viral myopericarditis. Typical cardiac chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes can be present in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as well as in myopericarditis, especially its focal form. Few case reports have been published on this rare and important mimic [2, 3]. We present a case of a young male who presented with indistinguishable features and was treated as STEMI, later to turn out as focal myocarditis.A previously healthy 33-year-old white male presented with sudden onset substernal chest pain that started while exercising on a treadmill one hour before. He described a left sided sharp, nonradiating pain that persisted till he presented to the ER. He had associated nausea, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. Nothing made it better. He denied heartburn, vomiting, cough, fever, and recent travel. He had no personal or family history of heart disease. On physical examination, he was a young athletic male with normal vital signs, and he appeared in distress from the pain. His cardiovascular examination was normal with no murmurs or pericardial rubs. He had an elevated troponin I at 21.9 ng/ml and an EKG ST segment elevation in the inferior leads (Figure 1). All other baseline laboratory tests were within normal limits. A STEMI alert was placed, and patients had an emergent left cardiac catheterization that reported normal coronary anatomy with no obstructing coronary stenosis (Figures 2 and 3). A left ventriculogram was also normal. He was started on a heparin drip and transferred to the coronary care unit. A plain chest X-ray did not reveal any pulmonary lesions or consolidation, and a chest CT angiogram ruled out pulmonary embolism. A transthoracic echocardiogram done reported a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (EF 50–55%) and a slight enlargement of the right ventricle without any wall motion abnormalities. Two days after presentation, the patient still reported continued chest pain and had an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). At this point, a cardiac MRI was done (Figures 4–7) that demonstrated epicardial and midmyocardial enhancement in the inferior wall, sparing of the subendocardial region, and overlying focal pericardial enhancement, consistent with EKG changes. He was started on indomethacin; his symptoms improved in the following 5 days, and he was discharged.The presentation of myopericarditis is widely variable from asymptomatic to focal or diffuse myopericarditis, congestive failure, and even sudden cardiac death. Diffuse myopericarditis has well variable presentation and EKG changes, reflecting the degree of myonecrosis. Certain changes on EKG are associated with myocarditis rather than pure pericarditis, such as ST segment elevations and occurrence of arrhythmias as was evident in our patient [4]. Focal myopericarditis on the other hand may have EKG findings indistinguishable from STEMI as is seen in our case. Chest pain with unusual cardiac risk profile and normal coronary angiography should raise suspicion of focal myopericarditis. The gold standard for diagnosis of myocarditis is endomyocardial biopsy, which has variable sensitivity of up to 64% [5]. The noninvasive cardiac MRI is increasingly being used to make the diagnosis of myocarditis and is associated with sensitivity of up to 90% in one study [6, 7]. The pattern of myocarditis on MRI includes focal or global calculated myocardial early enhancement ration greater than 4.5 compared to skeletal muscles, focal or global intense T2 signal indicative of edema, or late gadolinium enhancement with nonregional ischemic distribution. These often involve epicardium towards myocardium, typically sparing the subendocardium, while myocardial infarction displays a pattern of enhancement involving the subendocardium [8–10]. Using the Lake Louise Consensus criteria [10], our patients’ findings were consistent with myocarditis by displaying early gadolinium enhancement ratios, regional T2 signal edema, and myocardial late gadolinium enhancement. It is arguable that the region of cardiac MRI findings could have been consistent with a spontaneously reperfused coronary artery disease, and this theory could not be proven in our case. Our patient had no traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease, though the sudden onset of symptoms pointed to ACS and the coronary angiograms was clear of atherosclerosis.Similar presentations to this patient that were ruled out include Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as the ventriculogram was normal during cardiac catheterization. The coronary anatomy was normal, and thus both coronary artery disease and spontaneous coronary dissection were ruled out. Our patient had no eosinophilia on peripheral blood testing; hence, hyper eosinophilic myocarditis and hypersensitivity myocarditis were also ruled out.Focal myopericarditis may present with typical chest pain, ST segment elevation on EKG, and biomarker elevation that may be indistinguishable from STEMI. Unusual cardiac risk profile, in absence of traditional cardiac risk factors, should raise suspicion of alternative diagnosis. Cardiac MRI is useful in distinguishing myopericarditis from MI.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

We present a case of a 46-year-old male patient who developed VZV myocarditis and presented with recurrent syncopal episodes followed by a cardiac arrest. He had a further collapse eight years later, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated mild mid-wall basal and inferolateral wall fibrosis. He was treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and represented two years later with ICD shocks, and interrogation of the device revealed ventricular fibrillation episodes. This case demonstrates the life-threatening long-term sequelae of VZV myocarditis in adults. We suggest that VZV myocarditis should be considered in all patients who present with a syncopal event after VZV infection. In these patients, ICD implantation is a potentially life-saving procedure.Infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) predominantly affects children and is, in most cases, a self-limiting and benign condition. However, in rare cases, it may lead to life-threatening cardiac complications [1]. We report a 46-year-old male patient who developed recurrent ventricular arrhythmias following the diagnosis of chicken pox.A 46-year-old male patient was first admitted to the emergency department of our hospital 12 years ago with recurrent episodes of collapse and a documented ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest requiring emergency cardioversion by the paramedic team. The patient gave a 5-day history of general malaise and fever and a 24-hour history of an itchy vesicular rash. He had no relevant past medical history, but both his children had been diagnosed with chicken pox two weeks ago.On examination, he was apyrexial, with a normal cardiovascular examination. He had multiple widespread erythematous, vesicular lesions approximately 2 mm across with some weeping that involved all limbs and his trunk. The haematological and biochemical investigations were normal, apart from a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 70 mg/L (normal ≤ 5 mg/L). The resting electrocardiogram (ECG) was within normal limits with a QTc interval of 403 msec. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed normal biventricular structure and function with no regional wall motion abnormalities and normal cardiac valves. Intravenous amiodarone was administered for 24 hours, and no further arrhythmias were detected. In addition, he was treated with intravenous acyclovir for 10 days. He made an uneventful recovery. The patient took his own discharge a few days following the acute presentation.He represented 8 years later with a further syncopal event lasting for less than a minute. He was on treatment with citalopram 20 mg od prescribed by his general practitioner for anxiety. He had a normal clinical examination, and the biochemical investigations were within normal limits. The resting ECG confirmed sinus rhythm with a normal QTc interval of 430 msec. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed normal biventricular function but also mild mid-wall myocardial enhancement at the basal inferior and inferolateral walls consistent with myocarditis and no evidence of inducible ischaemia (Figures 1 and 2). He was reviewed by the electrophysiology consultant, and no findings suggestive of channelopathy were identified, and the patient was treated with nebivolol 10 mg od and flecainide 100 mg bd. Following discussion in the multidisciplinary cardiology meeting, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted (Boston Scientific ENERGEN F142).Two years later, he developed 2 further episodes of VF leading to ICD activation and shock. On examination, his heart rate was 67 beats per minute and regular, and the supine blood pressure was 163/58 mm Hg. He had normal heart sounds and no signs of heart failure. The routine full blood count and biochemistry were normal (serum potassium 4.2 mmol/L and magnesium 0.76 mmol/L), and the high sensitivity troponin was normal (3 ng/L). ICD interrogation revealed two appropriate shocks for VF (Figure 3). The resting ECG confirmed a normal QTc duration of 420 msec. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed normal biventricular structure and function with an ejection fraction of 55–60%. There were no regional wall motion abnormalities, and the valves were structurally normal.The patient continued to experience unifocal ventricular ectopic beats and short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). As a result, flecainide was stopped, and he was treated with intravenous amiodarone. He made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on nebivolol 10 mg od and amiodarone 200 mg od. Ablation therapy was not considered as an option as all the shocks were the result of VF and not VT.VZV infection leading to chicken pox is a common condition with the majority of cases occurring in childhood and is usually a benign and self-limiting disease. However, rarely, the infection may lead to life-threatening sequelae including encephalitis, myocarditis, and pneumonitis. These complications are more common in adults [1, 2].More than 20 viruses have been shown to cause myocarditis in humans. Varicella myocarditis was first described in 1953, based upon a study of seven necropsy findings [3], and in 1977, Fiddler et al. [4] reported a 10-year-old child who developed syncopal events caused by VT and VF after contact with his grandfather who had a VZV infection 2 weeks earlier.It is believed that the virus has a direct cytotoxic effect on the cardiac myocytes causing myocytolysis, necrosis, and oedema. In the acute phase, there is marked focal interstitial myocarditis with a collection of mononuclear cells, lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Autoimmune reactions are also believed to take place. Following the acute inflammatory response, the resultant fibrosis and scarring leads to an electrical conduction block and reentry circuits predisposing patients to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, VZV myocarditis may mimic acute myocardial infarction, and in some patients, it may lead to congestive heart failure [4–6].In these patients, anti-arrhythmic drugs such as flecainide, that acts on the sodium ion channels to delay myocyte recovery from excitation, also slows conduction through the scar tissue and may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Radiofrequency ablation treatment of scar tissue, resulting from myocarditis, is often challenging, as the scar tissue is often intramural or epicardial. In all these patients, the implantation of an ICD device is required to terminate the ventricular arrhythmia either by the delivery of a high voltage shock or a burst of rapid ventricular pacing to interrupt the reentry circuit. Treatment with the antiviral agent acyclovir is only beneficial in the early stages of viral replication within the myocardium, which coincides with the appearance of skin lesions [5, 7].Our case clearly demonstrates that VZV infection in an adult patient may lead to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias not only in the acute phase but long after the initial presentation. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of ventricular arrhythmias developing many years after the acute presentation of a VZV infection. We suggest, therefore, that in patients who present with a syncopal event after VZV infection, a high index of suspicion is required to investigate for potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. In these patients, the use of beta-blockade therapy and/or amiodarone, intravenous acyclovir, and ICD implantation is likely to improve the long-term outcome and prognosis.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.
Anticoagulation for the Pregnant Patient with a Mechanical Heart Valve, No Perfect Therapy: Review of Guidelines for Anticoagulation in the Pregnant Patient
1Department of Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, USA2Department of Cardiology, University of Florida College of Medicine Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Aaron Richardson; ude.lfu.xaj@nosdrahcir.noraaReceived 26 May 2017; Revised 18 September 2017; Accepted 25 October 2017; Published 22 November 2017Academic Editor: Magnus BaumhäkelCopyright © 2017 Aaron Richardson et al.

Guidelines currently recommend using a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) such as warfarin. Given the teratogenic effects of VKAs, it is often favorable to switch to heparin-derived therapies in pregnant patients since they do not cross the placenta. However, these therapies are known to be less effective anticoagulants subjecting the pregnant patient to a higher chance of a thrombotic event. Guidelines currently recommend pregnant women requiring more than 5 mg a day of warfarin be switched to alternative therapy during the first trimester. This case report highlights a patient who was switched to alternative therapy during her first pregnancy and suffered a devastating cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Further complicating her situation was during a subsequent pregnancy; this patient continued warfarin use during the first trimester and experienced multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). This case highlights the increased risk of thrombotic events in pregnant patients with mechanical valves. It also highlights the difficulty of providing appropriate anticoagulation for the pregnant patient who has experienced thrombotic events on multiple anticoagulants.Heart valve replacement with a prosthetic mechanical valve requires lifelong anticoagulation [1]. The annual risk of a thrombotic event in patients not taking anticoagulation is approximately 4% while the risk in those on appropriate anticoagulation is 1% [2]. Current guidelines recommend use of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) with routine monitoring of prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) to ensure therapeutic range for anticoagulation therapy. However, the teratogenic effects of VKAs make these medications unfavorable to use in pregnant women. During pregnancy, patients are often switched to alternative anticoagulation therapies which include low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH), to avoid teratogenic effects from VKAs. However, heparin-derived anticoagulants have been proven to be not as effective as VKAs for anticoagulation with mechanical heart valves leaving the pregnant patient more vulnerable to a thrombotic event. Women and their physicians are left with the difficult decision of weighing the risk and benefits of anticoagulation during pregnancy. We present the case of a patient who was switched from warfarin to Lovenox during her first pregnancy and experienced a devastating bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke which ultimately ended in the loss of her unborn child. The patient became pregnant a second time but continued warfarin through the first trimester. She had multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIA) while on therapeutic warfarin therapy. Her case is unusual in that she experienced two thrombotic events on two 2 different anticoagulants. Although no perfect therapy has been identified for the pregnant patient with a mechanical valve, guidelines and recommendations for providers are discussed.A 25-year-old African American married female with a past medical history of a previous pregnancy that resulted in a missed abortion, depression, bilateral MCA stroke, sickle cell trait, and mitral valve congenital defect replaced with St. Jude mechanical valve in 2001 presented at 11 weeks pregnant for management of high-risk pregnancy. The patient was diagnosed at birth with a mitral valve defect which was surgically repaired at age 2. However, at the age of 12, her native mitral valve was replaced with a St. Jude Master Series 27 mm mitral valve prosthesis. After replacement with mechanical mitral valve, she was prescribed oral warfarin therapy for anticoagulation. Her anticoagulation was managed by her cardiologist at an outside facility with a target INR of 2.5 to 3.5. The patient admitted to being compliant with her warfarin therapy. The patient only noted one prior ischemic event, a TIA at 12 years old, which was attributed to a missed medication dose. She said her mother forgot to give her the medication prior to the TIA. Her INRs were checked weekly although the patient did not have any lab work to present at the time of presentation. Approximately seven months prior to presentation, the patient became pregnant for her first time. She was switched from warfarin to Lovenox therapy to avoid teratogenic effects of warfarin to the fetus. Lovenox dosage was 60 mg (1 mg per kg dosing) administered twice daily, with antifactor Xa monitored by her cardiologist. The patient admitted to strict compliance to this anticoagulation regimen without any missed dosages. During her 8th week of pregnancy, the patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of difficulty speaking and bilateral facial/upper extremity weakness. She was diagnosed with bilateral MCA infarcts and not deemed a candidate for intervention due to her pregnancy. During her admission for the stroke, the patient suffered a missed abortion. She was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation center for poststroke care and regained full motor and speech function. Approximately 3 months after her initial stroke, the patient became pregnant again. With this subsequent pregnancy, she was advised by her cardiologist to switch from warfarin therapy to Lovenox as she had done in the previous pregnancy. However, the patient refused given concern over another stroke even though she was aware of teratogenic risks to the unborn child. Although she was on a therapeutic dose of warfarin with regular INR checks, the patient had noted intermittent tingling around her mouth and numbness in her fingers during her first trimester, findings consistent with a TIA.She was admitted to the hospital under the OBGYN service with consultation to cardiology for recommendations on anticoagulation. It was noted that she was on a daily dose of 10 mg warfarin, and her INR was therapeutic at 3.0 at the time of hospital admission. In anticipation of possible procedures, her warfarin was discontinued, and the patient was placed on a heparin infusion with goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) two times greater than the control. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. Given concern for valve thrombosis, transthoracic echo was ordered for further evaluation of mechanical valve. The transthoracic echo showed decreased posterior leaflet motion of the mechanical valve. As a result, transesophageal echo was performed which revealed normal valve motion and no evidence of thrombus. Normal atria and ventricle sizes were noted with left ventricular ejection fraction at 65–70%. Hematology was consulted for further workup for thrombophilia. Workup was unremarkable except she was noted to be heterozygous for MTHFR C677T gene. Homocysteine was within normal limits. Upon discharge, the patient was again advised on the need to switch to Lovenox therapy for anticoagulation; however, the patient refused and requested to be placed back on warfarin. Warfarin was restarted at 10 mg per day, and heparin drip was continued until therapeutic INR could be reached. The patient was discharged with follow-up with outside providers for INR checks and continued prenatal care. Since the patient did not follow up at our facility, it is unknown if she was able to deliver to term without any ischemic events or any effects to the fetus.Management of anticoagulation in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves is a difficult challenge for patients and physicians. Finding a delicate balance between adequate protection from a thrombotic event without causing harm to the unborn child is not easy. There are currently no clinical controlled trials to guide anticoagulation therapy for pregnant women; thus, no “optimal” therapy exists [3]. Current guidelines are based mostly on small retrospective series. Use of VKAs is the standard of treatment for prevention of valve thrombosis and embolic events in the general population of people who have received a mechanical heart valve [4, 5]. However, VKAs are capable of crossing the placental barrier and have teratogenic effects which include congenital abnormalities such as midfacial hypoplasia and stippling of epiphyses, along with central nervous system abnormalities such as hydrocephalus and optic atrophy. Stillbirth and miscarriage can also occur [6]. Although warfarin can pose a threat to the fetus at any point in the pregnancy, the fetus is most vulnerable to teratogenic effects during the first trimester. Previous case series have proven the embryopathy rate to be as high as 5 to 7% to those exposed to warfarin in the first trimester [7]. Some literature does suggest that these effects are dose dependent and that daily doses less than 5 mg/day appear to significantly reduce the risks of fetal toxicity [8, 9]. Vitale et al. demonstrated that 88% of women with a warfarin dose > 5 mg/day had fetal complications with 9% incident of warfarin embryopathy. In comparison, women with daily dose < 5 mg/day had a 15% chance of fetal complications, and none had warfarin embryopathy [8].More recent data provide conflicting evidence of whether a safe dose of warfarin exists. McLintock et al. report several recent studies which suggest a dose relationship may exist for warfarin embryopathy, but no clear evidence could be found that warfarin embryopathy was dose related. Although a small number of cases were reported, there were five cases of warfarin embryopathy in women who were taking 5 mg or less of warfarin and seven cases in women who were taking more than 5 mg daily [10–14]. van Hagen et al. also reported no significant difference in fetal loss or miscarriage between high-dose warfarin (greater than 5 mg per day) and low-dose warfarin (5 mg per day or less) [15].Although the greatest risk for teratogenic effects is in the first trimester, warfarin fetopathy is reported throughout all 3 trimesters in patients taking warfarin. Vitale et al. report miscarriage (loss less than 20 weeks gestation) and stillbirth (loss greater than 20 weeks gestation) rates to be as high as 63.6% and 15%, respectively, in women taking daily warfarin doses greater than 5 mg. This is compared to a miscarriage and a stillbirth rate of 5.2% and 0%, respectively, in women taking a daily warfarin dose of 5 mg or less [8]. Soma-Pillay et al. also reported increasing rates of miscarriage and stillbirth in women with increased dosages of warfarin [11].The literature recommends switching to a LMWH for anticoagulation from the beginning of pregnancy through the first 12 weeks (end of first trimester). LMWH is preferred during the first trimester as it does not cross the placenta. However, LMWH is not as effective as VKAs in prevention of a thrombotic event; thus, a higher risk of maternal complications exists. UFH is another option but has also been shown to be inferior to VKAs for anticoagulation and requires inpatient admission. Ginsberg et al. report the incident of thrombotic events in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves to be 3.9% in pregnancies of women taking warfarin throughout the pregnancy, 9.2% in pregnancies of women who received UFH in the first trimester followed by warfarin, and 33% in pregnancies treated with UFH throughout the pregnancy [16]. Meschengieser et al. conducted a prospective cohort study which included 92 pregnant patients with mechanical heart valves. This study compared oral anticoagulation throughout with first trimester to subcutaneous heparin 12,500 units every 12 hours. It revealed a thrombotic rate of 4.92% with heparin and a 0.33% rate with warfarin [17]. Smaller reviews have examined the rate of thrombotic events in pregnant women receiving LMWH treatment. McLintock et al. report the rate of thrombosis in women receiving LMWH to be 6.9%; however, this number was not based on studies in which 5 or more pregnancies were included [18]. Larger studies are required to gain a better understanding of risk of thrombotic events in pregnant patients.For patients in which LMWH is used, monitoring of antifactor Xa levels is recommended to ensure therapeutic range of anticoagulation. This is reflected in the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines. However, manufacturers recommend that both peak and trough levels should be measured. Per review of the literature, it is recommended that peak anti-Xa levels be measured 4 to 6 hours after administration with target anti-Xa level of 1.0 IU/ml to 1.2 IU/ml. Trough anti-Xa levels of 0.6–0.7 IU/ml are recommended. Peak anti-Xa levels should not exceed 1.5 IU/ml [19]. Peak and trough levels are both noted to be necessary to ensure optimum therapy. Multiple authors have examined anti-Xa peak and trough levels and found most patients to have subtherapeutic trough levels. Elkayam and Goland examined anti-Xa trough and peak levels in 30 pregnant patients who had their anticoagulation switched to LMWH during their entire pregnancy. Eight patients were noted to be on anticoagulation for mechanical heart valves. A total of 187 paired peak and trough levels were obtained. The recommended peak anti-Xa level (0.7–1.2 U/ml) occurred in only 66% of the measurements, and 80% of trough levels were found to be subtherapeutic (<0.6 U/ml) [15]. No complications were noted in patients with mechanical valves. Quinn et al. examined LMWH dosing in 11 women with 12 pregnancies who had mechanical heart valves. Upon initiation of therapy, the women were started on twice daily dosing of LMWH at a dose of 1 mg/kg with subsequent monitoring of anti-Xa levels. They found a mean increase in dose of LMWH of 54.4% from base dosage was needed to achieve therapeutic anti-Xa levels [20]. Other authors have also demonstrated large numbers of subtherapeutic anti-Xa levels in pregnant patients using LMWH for anticoagulation [21, 22]. Subtherapeutic anti-Xa levels are known to place patients at an increased risk for thrombotic events [2]. Although these data support the need for routine monitoring of peak and trough anti-Xa levels, more prospective studies are needed. The ACC/AHA guidelines do not provide any guidance on measuring peak and trough anti-Xa levels at this time.Low-dose aspirin (75 mg to 100 mg) is recommended as an addition to VKA therapy during second and third trimesters for patients at a higher risk for embolic events and is included in the ACC/AHA guidelines. van Hagen et al. examined the use of low-dose aspirin therapy in the second and third trimesters. Out of 212 pregnant patients with mechanical heart valves, only 13 were given low-dose aspirin as add-on therapy during pregnancy. Out of these patients, none experienced a thrombotic event in the second or third trimester as opposed to 5 out of the remaining 199 who did not receive aspirin but had an event. Hemorrhagic events were noted in 8 of the 13 patients who received aspirin therapy (61.5%), and 41 of the 199 patients (20.6%) experienced hemorrhagic events in the no aspirin therapy group [15]. It was unclear how serious these hemorrhagic events were. It would appear aspirin does provide additional protection against ischemic events but does come with an increased risk of hemorrhage. Other studies with small number of patients have also shown a decrease in thrombotic events with adding aspirin; however, an increased risk of bleeding was noted in these patients as well [12, 18]. Given the limited number of patients in which the addition of aspirin therapy has been studied, it is not possible at this time to conclude whether the benefits of aspirin therapy outweigh the risk of hemorrhage.The current guidelines released in 2014 from the ACC/AHA do have recommendations for anticoagulation in patients with mechanical heart valves and specifically address management in pregnant patients. Class I recommendations are as follows. For all patients taking a VKA, such as warfarin, a therapeutic INR of 2-3 (INR of 2.5–3.5 for mitral valves) is recommended. In pregnant patients, warfarin may be used to achieve therapeutic INR in second and third trimesters. It is also recommended to discontinue warfarin and initiate IV UFH with aPTT greater than two times the control before planned vaginal delivery. Low-dose aspirin (75 mg to 100 mg) is also recommended during second and third trimesters [5, 23]. No Class I recommendations are available for anticoagulation during the first trimester. (Please see Table 1 for full ACC/AHA guidelines.)Planned delivery is recommended in all patients unless obstetric indications call for caesarean section. It is recommended that all women on VKA switch to LMWH or UFH at week 34–36 with induction or caesarean at around 38 weeks. UFH should be started approximately 24 hours prior to labor induction or caesarean with target aPTT at 2-3 times above baseline. IV UFH should be stopped once in labor or 6 hours prior to anesthesia administration confirming aPTT back to baseline. UFH should be restarted 4 to 6 hours post vaginal delivery or 6–12 hours post caesarean section with IV UFH at 500 IU/hour and increase over 24–48 hours to target aPTT. Warfarin should be restarted on day 1 postpartum (uncomplicated vaginal delivery) or on day 2-3 if caesarian or bleeding complications occur [18].Currently, there is no indication for the use of direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for anticoagulation in patients who have received a mechanical heart valve. Previous studies have shown that there is an increased risk of thrombotic events and bleeding when using a DOAC [24, 25]. Currently DOACs are not recommended for use in pregnant patients as they are able to cross into the placenta. Further study is needed to understand the effects of these medications [26].As for pregnant patients who suffer a thrombotic event while on appropriate anticoagulation therapy, there are no clear options for treatment. Surgical interventions are not recommended. However, an option for treating thrombosis during pregnancy is use of thrombolytic medications such as streptokinase or urokinase for up to 72 hours with no negative effects on fetus; however, the data are very limited [27]. There were no guidelines available to guide physicians in managing patients who have failed multiple anticoagulation regimens and suffered an ischemic event.Anticoagulation is a necessity for the pregnant patient with a mechanical heart valve. However, these women along with their physician are left with weighing risks to the mother and unborn child. Before an anticoagulation regimen is decided upon, risks should be explained to the expectant patient and family. Based on the literature and current guidelines, continuation of VKA therapy may be appropriate through the pregnancy if dosage is less than 5 mg a day. Since dosing is based on the amount needed to obtain a therapeutic INR, no guarantee can be made that a higher dose could be required during pregnancy. The decisions become even more difficult with a daily dose greater than 5 mg a day. The patient presented in this case is unusual as she experienced thrombotic events on 2 different anticoagulation therapies, one which included a VKA with a therapeutic INR. Although the patient suffered TIA symptoms during the second pregnancy, she was lost to follow-up; thus, it still remains unclear if she made it to term, suffered an ischemic event, or had other complications. There is also no clinical indication to perform a hypercoagulable workup in this patient population since there are no data to support a higher risk of thrombosis in patients with a mechanical heart valve who have a thrombophilia versus those who do not. Guidelines are unclear how to approach anticoagulation in pregnant patients who have experienced a thrombotic event while on guideline-directed therapy. Although aspirin could have been added to this patient’s therapy, there are no significant data pointing to an improved outcome as a much higher risk of hemorrhage has been noted. All women of childbearing age requiring anticoagulation for a mechanical valve should be counseled on the risk of a thrombotic event which could result in serious illness or death to her or the unborn child. As for patients who have suffered an ischemic event, even on a VKA, the answers become even more difficult.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Subacute Right Ventricular Perforation by Pacemaker Lead Causing Left-Sided Hemothorax and Epicardial Hematoma
1Internal Medicine Department, Wayne State University/Detroit Medical Center, Detroit, MI, USA2Division of Cardiology, Wayne State University/Detroit Medical Center, Detroit, MI, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Abdelrahman Ahmed; ude.enyaw.dem@demhamaReceived 1 April 2017; Revised 18 August 2017; Accepted 9 October 2017; Published 16 November 2017Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2017 Abdelrahman Ahmed et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We report a case of right ventricular wall perforation by a pacemaker lead in a 78-year-old female 18 days after a permanent pacemaker insertion. This injury necessitated explant of the perforating lead and implantation of a new one with surgical backup. We review the literature and discuss the possible risk and protective factors including lead models that were associated with higher incidence of perforation. We review the traditional pacing parameters and their lack of reliability to diagnose perforation and the need for low threshold to utilize imaging in appropriate clinical scenarios. The authors believe this case is of educational value to all health care professionals, especially emergency medicine and internal medicine residents, who routinely see patients with pacemakers complaining of chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness.It is estimated that more than 250,000 permanent cardiac devices are implanted each year in the United States alone [1]. The incidence of asymptomatic perforations, detected by CT chest is approximately 15% for all devices, 3% for pacemakers, and 14% for implantable cardioverter defibrillators [2]. It is suggested that symptomatic perforations are even less common. Besides prolonging hospitalizations, such complications can be life-threatening [3]. Hemothorax as a subacute complication of pacemaker insertions has been seldom reported in the literature.A 78-year-old African American woman had a past medical history of mild dementia, left subclavian artery stenosis, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and symptomatic sinus bradycardia for which a permanent pacemaker (DDDR mode, lower rate set at 60 beats per minute) was inserted 18 days prior to her presentation. She presented to the emergency room reporting sudden onset substernal sharp chest pain, left upper abdominal pain, and mild shortness of breath. Her blood pressure was 135/97 mmHg with regular heart rate and rhythm and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Cardiovascular exam revealed no murmurs, gallops, jugular venous distention, or lower limb edema. Lung auscultation was significant for diminished breath sounds at left base.Hemoglobin level was 13.5 gm/dl compared to 14.4 gm/dl 18 days ago. Chest X-ray showed mild left pleural effusion, and the right ventricular pacemaker lead was found to be overlying the left heart margin, raising the possibility of perforation (Figure 1). Device interrogation revealed that the lead paramaters, compared to the time of implantation 18 days ago, had changed as follows: impedance 1197 Ohms → 654 Ohms; sensing (R-wave amplitude) 11.9 mV → 18 mV; and capture threshold at a pulse width of 0.5 milliseconds remained the same at 1.0 volts. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, and transthoracic echocardiogram showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 75% and elevated filling pressure; a small heterogeneous collection in the pericardial sac was detected with no evidence of tamponade, and the lead was visualized in the right ventricle. Device interrogation revealed no change in the capture or sensing thresholds and decreased impedance (645 versus 1197 Ohms). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed the tip of the right ventricular lead penetrating the anterior wall of the right ventricle and terminating in the left anterior chest wall. There was also a 2 × 5.8 cm epicardial hematoma surrounding the tip of the lead (Figure 2).The displaced lead was extracted, and the new lead was positioned in the midseptum (Figure 3). Excellent pacing and sensing parameters were recorded, and the lead was then fixed to the pectoralis muscle. This was done in the operating room under intracardiac echocardiogram monitoring and surgical backup. A left-sided chest tube was inserted draining over 300 ml of bloody fluid and was removed after three days.She had a smooth postoperative course with resolution of her symptoms and was discharged home in a stable condition and was doing well on follow-up one month later.Device-related ventricular wall perforations are acute, subacute, or chronic/delayed when they occur within 24 hours, one month, or more than one month after implantation, respectively [4]. Our patient suffered a symptomatic subacute perforation by the right ventricular lead following pacemaker insertion. Only few prior cases reported the occurrence of left hemothorax in cases of subacute perforation.In a large retrospective study of 4280 patients who underwent pacemaker insertions between 1995 and 2003, Mahapatra et al. concluded that oral steroid use during the seven days preceding the procedure was the strongest predictor for cardiac perforation (HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1–10.0, ), which is possibly explained by an induced myocardial atrophy [5]. Also, the use of a temporary pacemaker prior to the permanent pacemaker insertion was a significant risk factor (hazard ratio (HR) 3.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6–6.2, ) [3]. Other risk factors included older age and female gender, both of which are present in our case.According to the same study, active ventricular lead fixation with helical screws seems to play a role in many cases (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.6–4.2, ) [3]. However, Sterliński et al.’s study of 2247 lead implantations between January 1, 2007, and March 31, 2008, found no correlation between the perforation rate and any particular model of the implanted lead [6]. Nevertheless, Acha et al. in 2015 looked at the incidence of perforation in 72 cases implanted with Medtronic CapSureFix 5086 MRI SureScan leads, the original MRI-compatible leads, and compared them to 420 cases implanted with Medtronic SureScan leads 4076 and 5076, which were not specifically designed for MRI compatibility. Perforations occurred in 5.5% versus 0.47% of the cases, respectively ( = 0.005) [7]. This was partly attributed to a change in cable design and active fixation helix which was thought to increase complication rates. In another study, the perforation incidence with St. Jude Riata ICD leads was 2.6% compared to 0% with the Medtronic Sprint Fidelis leads in the same time period () [8].Atrial perforations are more common than ventricular perforations due to their thinner walls, and the apex is the most common site of perforation within the right ventricle. Subsequently, the use of the right ventricular outflow tract and septum as alternative sites has been suggested in high-risk patients [2, 9].Several studies evaluated the performance of leadless pacemakers showing favorable outcomes compared to traditional pacemakers. Medtronic Micra transcatheter pacing system (TPS) and St. Jude Nanostim leadless cardiac pacemaker (LCP) reduce the risk of transvenous leads and generator pocket complications. The Micra TPS investigational device exemption study reported a 1.6% risk of perforation [10, 11]. Interestingly, the LEADLESS II study reported a similar perforation risk of 1.6% studying 527 implantations of Nanostim LCPs.Clinical manifestations of cardiac perforations depend on the location of the perforating lead tip and vary from being asymptomatic to life-threatening pericardial effusions. The most commonly reported symptoms are chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, and syncope [4]. Hiccups, secondary to phrenic nerve stimulation, and left chest muscle twitching, due to stimulation of the left pectoralis major by the lead tip, have been reported as well [12, 13].In terms of diagnosis, CT scan of the chest remains a helpful adjunct to radiography and echocardiography for visualizing the lead tip and confirming the diagnosis with its ability to localize the exact site of the perforating lead tip despite the star artifact, which is a well-known artifact related to the imaging of metal implants [1]. While chest X-ray is usually the initial test performed, it may not be able to detect minimal lead migration. Nevertheless, it is still a valuable diagnostic tool being able to detect life-threatening complications associated with cardiac perforation such as pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, and large-sized hemothoraces. In addition, it is necessary to compare the lead tip position and curvature with posteroanterior and lateral chest X-rays right after the procedure [4]. Echocardiogram is not reliable given the possibility of missing the perforation altogether which was evident in our case as well.Diagnosing a lead perforation, by utilizing the classic pacing parameters (sensing, capture, and impedence), can be misleading. Fundamentally, a lead perforation is a subset of lead dislodgement, and as such, they can share similar characteristic parameter changes. To understand the potential changes one may encounter, a brief overview is necessary.The change in device pacing parameters depends on the location of the displaced tip. However, absence of abnormal values does not rule out perforation [2, 4]. The three parameters used are lead impedance, sensing (R-wave amplitude), and capture (pacing threshold). Lead impedance is the sum of all factors that resist the flow of electric current through the lead. The direction of change in impedance in lead perforation varies depending on where the perforating lead lies. If the lead migrates to an air-filled space, like the lung, the impedance would increase as air has more impedance than blood. If the lead ends up in a fluid-filled space, the change in impedance may not be significant [5, 14]. Sensing, measured in millivolts, is the myocardial electric signal (R-wave in the case of right ventricular leads) detected by the lead. It is important to note that the lead does not have to be in direct contact with a heart surface to detect the signals, just as EKG leads are placed on the body surface and can still detect electrical activity in the heart. Sensing values are usually expected to decrease, and this case, to the best of our knowledge, is the first in the literature where sensing values have increased. It is worth noting that this value can significantly be affected by the alignment of the lead with the electric current vector. The more parallel the two, the larger the R-wave is, and thus if the lead’s new position after migration was more parallel to the electric current vector, this R-wave can be larger in value. Pacing threshold (capture) is the minimal amount of energy required to detect electrical activity in the myocardium. The smaller this value, the better as IT ( add IT) saves the battery life of the system. In case of lead perforation and migration, the change in capture threshold depends on the distance between the migrated lead tip and the initial area of implantation. A lead piercing the heart may not travel a long distance, leading to almost unchanged pacing threshold, and a lead migrating through the pulmonary artery traveling a longer distance can have capture failure.Changes in pacing parameters suggest lead dislodgement. A perforation represents a specific type of dislodgement with mortal potential. At the time of implantation of pacing leads, the implanter may elect to manually dislodge his lead due to an unacceptable parameter (sensing, capture, or impedance) and move to a more acceptable position. During implantation, this was elective; similarly, a lead can spontaneously dislodge to a position that has similar, worse, or even better parameters than the original implant site. No specific parameter will necessary be inclusive or exclusive of the specific type or position of the dislodgement, nor can it differentiate between lead dislodgement and perforation. Once lead perforation or dislodgement is suspected, it is imperative that the patient undergoes imaging to differentiate between the two.To conclude the discussion about pacing parameters, the following rules should always be considered:(1)Change in pacing parameters suggests lead dislodgement (not necessarily lead perforation).(2)Lack of change in pacing parameters does not exclude lead dislodgement (or perforation).(3)There is no consistent lead pacing parameters to rule in or out dislodgement/perforation.(4)Once a change in parameter is detected and lead dislodgement is suspected, clinicians should proceed to imaging studies to differentiate between lead dislodgement and perforation.Table 1 summarizes the expected changes in pacing parameters when pacemaker leads perforate the heart wall and also explains why these changes are inconsistent.Management strategies include lead repositioning, lead extraction, or open heart surgery. In hemodynamically stable patients, the preferred strategy is lead extraction under close echocardiographic monitoring with surgical backup followed by new lead placement in a different location. Interestingly, prior case reports described the successful use of fibrin glue patch or cyanoacrylate glue, injected through the pericardial space, to seal RV perforation secondary to pacemaker leads [15, 16]. In cases of hemodynamic instability, rapidly progressive pericardial effusion, or injury of surrounding organs, surgical management is the recommended treatment [1]. Some studies suggest that the extraction of a chronically perforated lead, without neither device malfunction nor resulting symptoms, is not mandatory [2].The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
The Use of Adenosine to Enable Safe Implantation of Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve
Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, IsraelCorrespondence should be addressed to Vicki Zeniou; moc.liamtoh@soinezikcivReceived 30 July 2017; Accepted 14 September 2017; Published 16 November 2017Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2017 Vicki Zeniou et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.High precision is necessary during percutaneous transcatheter heart valve implantation. The precision of the implantation has been established by increasing the heart rate (usually to 200 beats per minute) to the point of significantly reduced cardiac output and thus minimizing valve movement. Routinely, this tachycardia is induced by rapid pacing. Here we report a case of failure to pace during valve-in-valve (VIV) Edwards Sapien XT implantation in the tricuspid valve position. Transient cardiac arrest was induced by intravenous adenosine injection enabling accurate valve implantation.Transcatheter valve-in-valve (VIV) procedures are relatively new procedures performed increasingly in degenerative bioprosthetic valves as an alternative to surgical replacement. The procedure has challenging technical aspects and requires high level of accuracy. During valve implantation, accuracy is achieved by rapid pacing, which reduces cardiac output and minimizes involuntary valve movement. For this reason, a temporary electrode is placed in the right ventricle.For tricuspid VIV procedures, pacing may be induced by an electrode placed either in the left ventricle or in the coronary sinus. An attempt may also be made to deploy the valve without pacing due to the low flow velocity in the right ventricle outflow tract.This is a case of failed rapid pacing during tricuspid VIV implantation. Adenosine was used as an alternative to create temporary heart block, enabling accurate valve deployment during the cardiac arrest period. Adenosine inhibits atrioventricular (AV) node conduction, leading to a short-acting AV block and temporary cardiac asystole [1].A 63-year-old female with a medical history of rheumatic heart disease, ischemic heart disease, chronic atrial fibrillation, past stroke, and cerebral palsy, who underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement and biological tricuspid valve replacement (Edwards Lifesciences, Perimount 29 mm) at the age of 55, was currently admitted with shortness of breath and severe pitting leg edema. Echocardiography revealed moderate aortic stenosis (mean gradient 30 mmHg), good function of the mechanical mitral valve, severe (free) tricuspid valve regurgitation, and significant tricuspid valve stenosis (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The maximal velocity through the tricuspid valve was measured to be 2.06 m/s with a calculated maximal pressure gradient of 17 mmHg and a mean pressure gradient of 11 mmHg. A right heart catheterization that was performed verified these measurements. STS score for mortality was 9%, and the patient was considered by the heart team to be extremely high risk for surgery. The patient was thus referred for percutaneous transfemoral tricuspid VIV implantation under conscious sedation. Due to normal right-ventricular contraction and high systolic pressures, it was decided to perform the procedure with rapid pacing. Several options for placement of the electrode were considered. Insertion of a right-ventricular electrode is associated with the risk of it being jailed between the old and new prostheses. Furthermore, insertion of a left-ventricular electrode is technically difficult due to the presence of aortic stenosis. In addition, rapid right-atrial pacing did not allow for proper capture of the ventricle. It was decided to place a temporary electrode in the coronary sinus for rapid pacing, but again rapid ventricular pacing could not be achieved due to technical difficulties. Therefore, cardiac arrest was attempted with 6 mg of adenosine; however, this dose was not adequate, and thereafter cardiac arrest was induced with bolus injection of 18 mg of adenosine through a peripheral vein access. Asystole was induced, and a balloon expandable valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Sapien XT 29 mm) was deployed in the tricuspid valve bioprosthesis (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). Asystole lasted for nine seconds, allowing slow and accurate balloon inflation and valve deployment. Asystole was followed by slow resumption of cardiac rhythm at a heart rate of 60 bpm. Recovery was immediate, postprocedural course was uneventful, and echocardiography demonstrated normal left- and right-ventricular function, with no significant tricuspid valve stenosis (mean 5 mmHg) and mild tricuspid paravalvular regurgitation (Figures 1(e) and 1(f)). Echocardiographic follow-up of the patient a year after the procedure showed good global systolic function, with mild paravalvular leak of the tricuspid valve. Heart movement during the cardiac cycle can impact the accuracy of valve implantation, resulting in possible displacement and subsequently increasing the rate of complications.Cardiac movement might influence the height of implantation in relation to the aortic annulus and increase the probability of paravalvular leak and atrioventricular conduction disturbances, which, in turn, may negatively influence the prognosis of the patient. These movements mainly have an effect on balloon expandable valves, and therefore rapid pacing is considered mandatory during such procedures. Adenosine administered intravenously can induce transient cardiac arrest by inhibiting AV nodal conduction. Having a half-life from 10 to 30 seconds, its effect is achieved rapidly after injection (10–15 seconds) and lasts for several seconds (the drug is cleared from the plasma within 30 seconds). Thus, it has suitable pharmacological features for potential use to induce heart arrest during percutaneous cardiac interventions. The adverse effects are self-limiting, and during the procedure there was no case of bronchospasm.The literature reveals adenosine being successfully used to enhance accurate deployment of stent grafts in the thoracic aorta [2, 3] and in the implantation of an ostial coronary stent [4]. Davidavicius et al. performed a prospective pilot study and found the use of adenosine safe and feasible to achieve cardiac arrest in 20 patients who underwent TAVI with balloon valvuloplasty in whom rapid pacing would be not well tolerated [5]. Furthermore, it has been reported that adenosine has been used in extracardiac procedures. Pile-Spellman et al. used a rapid injection of 64 mg of adenosine to induce rapid reversible high atrioventricular block and hypotension in order to effectively and safely deposit glue in cerebral arteriovenous malformations during microsurgical resection [6]. After this, Groff et al. published a case in which 6 mg in addition to another 12 mg of adenosine was administered through a central venous catheter to induce hypotension and collapse of the aneurysm in an arteriovenous malformation allowing for closure with a clip [7]. To our knowledge, the current report is the first description of adenosine-induced temporary heart block during percutaneous valve implantation. As it was described above, adenosine could safely enable valve deployment during the tricuspid VIV procedure during which other techniques of reducing cardiac output were unavailable or difficult to pursue.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.Vicki Zeniou and Shmuel Chen equally contributed to this work.
AngioVac System Used for Vegetation Debulking in a Patient with Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature
1Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA2Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, DMC/Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Hossam Abubakar; ude.enyaw@rakabuba.massohReceived 16 August 2017; Accepted 3 October 2017; Published 7 November 2017Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2017 Hossam Abubakar et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.AngioVac is a vacuum-based device approved in 2014 for percutaneous removal of undesirable materials from the intravascular system. Although numerous reports exist with regard to the use of the AngioVac device in aspiration of iliocaval, pulmonary, upper extremity, and right-sided heart chamber thrombi, very few data are present demonstrating its use in treatment of right-sided endocarditis. In this case report, we describe the novel device used in debulking a large right-sided tricuspid valve vegetation reducing the occurrence of septic embolisation and enhancing the efficacy of antibiotics in clearance of bloodstream infection. Further research is needed in larger RSIE patient populations to confirm the benefits and the potential of improved outcomes associated with the AngioVac device as well as identify its potential complications.A 33-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C and active intravenous heroin use presented to an outside facility with complaints of worsening shortness of breath. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was done and showed tricuspid valve (TV) vegetation measuring 3 × 1.5 cm with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). CT scan of the chest revealed signs concerning septic pulmonary emboli. She was also found to have severe sepsis and was transferred to the coronary care unit for further management. Blood cultures on admission yielded Streptococcus pyogenes, and she was empirically started on vancomycin, linezolid, and cefepime until organisms were shown to be pan-sensitive after which antibiotic coverage was narrowed to penicillin G. Clindamycin was added for synergism, given her extensive septic pulmonary emboli. Repeat blood cultures revealed the same organism for 3 consecutive days. Her respiratory status continued to worsen, and she was consequently intubated. No source other than intravenous drug use (IVDU) was found to be the cause of the bacteremia. Due to the size of the vegetation and persistent bacteremia despite appropriate medical therapy, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for the possibility of surgical intervention, but the patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate due to her poor nutritional state and hemodynamic instability. After discussion with the family regarding the patient’s critically ill state and poor prognosis, a decision was made to transfer her to our facility for debulking of the tricuspid valve vegetation using the AngioVac system. A repeat TTE at our facility confirmed prior findings of TV vegetation measuring 3 × 1.5 cm and moderate TR (Figure 1). Blood cultures repeated at our facility revealed no growth. The patient was immediately taken to the catheterization laboratory for vegetation debulking using the AngioVac system.The patient arrived in the catheterization laboratory intubated and sedated. Bilateral femoral veins were accessed using the modified Seldinger technique. A 6-French (Fr) precision sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein, and an 8-French sheath was inserted into the left common femoral vein. A 6-French sheath was inserted into the right internal jugular vein (IJ). The right IJ was then progressively dilated with escalating size sheaths and, subsequently, a 24-French sheath was placed over a Lunderquist wire. The left common femoral vein sheath was escalated to a 16-French outlet sheath. The AngioVac system was advanced through the right IJ—a 24-French inlet sheath over a Wholey wire. Under transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance, the system was further advanced via the superior vena cava and right atrium towards the TV, where the vegetation was then repeatedly suctioned. Two pieces of the vegetation were successfully extracted. The intraprocedural TEE revealed a 50–60% reduction in the size of the TV vegetation (2.1 cm decrease in the longest dimension) (Figures 2 and 3). The AngioVac system was removed, and hemostasis was achieved in both the right IJ and the left common femoral venous accesses via purse-string sutures. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Heparin was used for anticoagulation during the procedure.The patient’s condition improved, and she was extubated on the second day after the procedure. Antibiotics therapy continued. Subsequent blood cultures remained negative, and she became afebrile with a steady decline in her white blood cell count. Seven days after the AngioVac procedure, she was discharged to a rehabilitation facility to finish six weeks of intravenous penicillin G therapy. During a follow-up appointment at an infectious disease clinic one month after hospital discharge, the patient was seen with no symptoms or signs of reinfection.The vast majority of cases of right-sided infective endocarditis (RSIE) are in the intravenous drug use (IVDU) population [1]. Epidemiological studies have shown that, among IVDU patients who present with fever, 13% will have echocardiographic evidence of IE [2] and 41% of bacteremic IVDU patients will have evidence of IE, the majority of which is RSIE [3]. Clinical features are distinct from those of left-sided endocarditis. The most common manifestations are fever and sepsis in addition to symptoms related to septic pulmonary emboli including chest pain, dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis [4]. Although the Duke criteria have their theoretical limitations when applied in diagnosing RSIE, they remain the most widely utilized criteria for diagnosis [4]. The close association of the disease to IVDU creates obstacles to successful treatment. These challenges include nonadherence to in-hospital treatment and noncompliance to follow-up, creating scarcity of data on long-term outcomes [1]. Despite these challenges, RSIE is shown to have a relatively more favorable prognosis when compared to left-sided disease with an in-hospital mortality of less than 10% [1].Management is multidisciplinary and involves the involvement of a general cardiologist, an infectious disease specialist, a cardiac surgeon, and, occasionally, an interventional cardiologist. There is sufficient evidence that, in uncomplicated cases of RSIE caused by Staphylococcus aureus, two weeks of antibiotic therapy is sufficient [5]. Antibiotic treatment of nonstaphylococcal RSIE, as in our case, is analogous to that of left-sided disease and includes an extended treatment course of 4–6 weeks [6]. While indications of surgery for left-sided disease are well established, the role of surgery in RSIE is less clear. Nevertheless, there are complications where surgery is agreed to be reasonable. These include right heart failure secondary to severe tricuspid regurgitation with poor response to medical therapy, sustained infection caused by difficult-to-treat organisms (i.e., fungi and multidrug-resistant bacteria) or lack of response to appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and tricuspid valve vegetations that are ≥ 20 mm in diameter and recurrent pulmonary embolism despite antimicrobial therapy [6]. When surgery is warranted, valve repair rather than replacement is preferred especially in IVDU patients due to the risk of recurrence of infection in prosthetic valves [6]. Our patient had a tricuspid valve vegetation with a diameter of >30 mm, which led to the consideration of surgical intervention. Due to the patient’s poor nutritional status, respiratory failure due to multiple septic emboli, and early signs of DIC, she was deemed an unsuitable candidate for open cardiac surgery.A noninvasive approach utilizing the AngioVac device was justified, given our patient’s critically ill state and high perioperative risk. The US Food and Drug Administration approved the AngioVac system for removal of unwanted intravascular materials (thrombi and emboli) in 2014 [7]. The device is composed of a venous drainage cannula and a reinfusion (venous return) cannula which are connected to an extracorporeal circuit and a commercially available pump head and bubble trap. The venous drainage component is a 22 Fr cannula with a funnel-shaped distal tip that can be advanced through a 26 Fr sheath over a guidewire into the venous system percutaneously. When the bypass pump is started, a suction force is created that facilitates aspiration of blood and thrombotic materials into the tip of the AngioVac cannula, circulating the blood through a filter. After filtration, the drained blood is returned to the patient via a second percutaneously placed reinfusion venous cannula through the internal jugular or femoral vein [8]. This recirculation of venous blood minimizes intraprocedural blood loss and the need of blood transfusion. There are numerous reports on the use of the AngioVac device in aspiration of iliocaval, pulmonary, upper extremity, and right-sided heart chamber thrombi [8]. In contrast to alternative percutaneous thrombectomy devices that require prior thrombus fragmentation and/or thrombolysis to facilitate aspiration, the AngioVac device has the advantage of aspirating the whole intact thrombus. This eliminates the need of preaspiration thrombolysis and reduces the consequent risk of embolisation [9].Very few data are present with regard to the use of the AngioVac device management of RSIE. The biggest study to date by George et al. reviewed the periprocedural course of 33 patients with tricuspid valve (TV) endocarditis who underwent TV vegetation debulking using the AngioVac device. Average preprocedural vegetation size was 2.1 ± 0.7 cm and average vegetation size on postprocedural echocardiography was 0.82 ± 0.5 cm, demonstrating a 61% average reduction in vegetation size that is in parallel to that seen in our patient. All patients in the study survived the procedure, and 90.9% survived the hospitalization with no further reinfection. We searched two literature databases (PubMed and Embase) to identify publications reporting the use of the AngioVac device for treatment of RSIE (results in Table 1). Most reported indications for the use of the AngioVac device for vegetation debulking in RSIE are consistent with AHA proposed indications of surgery [6]. However, there are reports on utilization of the AngioVac system to debulk lead vegetations as a bridge to percutaneous lead removal in patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic device- (CIED-) related endocarditis [10–12]. Despite data that demonstrate the safety of percutaneous lead removal in patients with vegetations >1 cm [13], the risk of septic pulmonary embolism remains significant at 34–55% in this subset of patients [14, 15]. This predisposes to further infectious complications including pulmonary abscesses and refractory sepsis. Although large population data are lacking, Patel et al. proposed that the AngioVac device used for large vegetation debulking prior to percutaneous lead removal may reduce the incidence of septic pulmonary embolism in patients with CIED-related endocarditis [11]. The use of the novel technique has also been reported as a bridge to reduce lag time and perioperative complications of cardiac surgery [7, 16]. Diminishing intracardiac vegetation size and the associated bacterial load may increase the efficacy of antibiotics in clearing of the bloodstream infection. This concept is supported by studies investigating the efficacy of antibiotics on different bacterial inoculums [17]. High bacterial inoculums are associated with higher antibiotic resistance and reduced penetration, a phenomenon known as the inoculum effect [18]. Through vegetation debulking, the AngioVac allows for reduction of the bacterial inoculum and enhancement of antibiotic activity. This hastens resolution of the septic state and consequent hemodynamic compromise which is a key determinant of operative and postoperative mortality associated with cardiac surgery [19].Our case describes a novel modality of treatment in RSIE. Although currently approved for removal of intravascular thrombi and emboli, the AngioVac device may be a promising noninvasive treatment option for RSIE for a multitude of indications. The novel modality may be used as a substitute for surgery where surgery is indicated but not possible due to associated perioperative risk. The device may also be utilized as a bridge to surgery and percutaneous CIED removal by reducing the perioperative risk through hastening clearance of infection, improving hemodynamics, and reducing the risk of periprocedural septic pulmonary embolism. Further research is needed in larger RSIE patient populations to confirm the benefits and the potential of improved outcomes associated with the AngioVac device as well as identify its potential complications.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Congenital absence of the left circumflex artery is a rare coronary anomaly with few reported cases in the literature. These patients are usually diagnosed incidentally when they undergo coronary angiography or coronary CT to rule out underlying coronary artery disease. In this article, we report a case of a 46-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a congenitally absent left circumflex artery with a superdominant right coronary artery after a workup was initiated for frequent premature ventricular contractions and regional wall motion on echocardiogram. A review of the clinical presentation, symptoms, and diagnostic modalities used to diagnose this entity is presented.Congenital absence of the left circumflex (LCX) artery is a rare coronary anomaly with an incidence of 10 in 1495 (0.0067%) patients [1, 2]. Due to its uncommon nature, diagnosis can be challenging, especially among patients who present with acute cardiac symptoms. It may initially be misdiagnosed as complete occlusion of the left circumflex artery [3]. A better understanding of the natural history and clinical implications of this condition may allow us to diagnose and manage this condition with an algorithmic approach. We present a case of congenitally absent left circumflex artery with a superdominant right coronary artery (RCA) detected by coronary angiography and confirmed by coronary CT. Also, a review of previously published cases in literature and their clinical outcomes is presented.In addition to the present case, a systematic review of case reports/short cases in OVID looking at patients who presented with congenitally absent left circumflex artery was performed. The review only considered papers published in the English language. An electronic search strategy with the keywords Left circumflex AND Absent OR Absence AND Congenital was used. Duration of published papers was defined between and 1946 and October 2016. Definitions used for case-inclusion were (a) age greater than 18 years and (b) diagnosis of left circumflex artery abnormality either by CT/MRI or coronary angiography (Figure 1).A 46-year-old man with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department with an episode of transient loss of consciousness after a mechanical fall. He had no preceding chest pain or palpitations. There was no history of syncope, presyncope, loss of consciousness, diabetes, hypertension, or seizure disorder. On admission, vital signs showed heart rate of 88 bpm, BP of 115/83 mmhg, oxygen saturation of 95% on room air, and respiratory rate of 18 cpm. Physical examination was within normal limits including no neurological deficits. Computed tomography of the brain showed normal findings with no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. Labs were all within normal limits including a negative troponin.While the patient was being monitored in the emergency department he was noted to be in sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). An EKG showed sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in the inferior leads and frequent PVCs. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40–45%, with akinesis of the basal-mid inferior segments. These findings led to a coronary angiogram that showed a very large sized, dominant RCA supplying the entire lateral wall; normal left main and left anterior descending (LAD) arteries; and a congenitally absent left circumflex artery (Figure 2). A subsequent cardiac 64 multislice CT scan confirmed the absence of the LCX and showed an RCA with a large posterolateral artery that supplied the entire lateral wall. The LAD was normal (Figure 3). Given the unexplained regional wall motion abnormality, a cardiac MRI was performed which revealed viable myocardium with no areas of late gadolinium enhancement. The calculated LVEF was 40% on the cardiac MRI; the patient was initiated on metoprolol for his frequent PVCs, appropriate therapy for his systolic dysfunction, and discharged home with primary care and cardiology follow-up. On a subsequent Holter monitor, he continued to have occasional PVCs but no ventricular arrhythmias were detected.To the best of our knowledge, 20 cases of absent left circumflex artery have been described in the literature that met our inclusion criteria. Our case is the first to be diagnosed due to workup of occasional PVCs but shared some similarities with previously published reports.Table 1 summarizes the baseline demographics, comorbidities, presentation findings, and diagnostic modalities for all patients. There were 15 male and 8 female patients with a mean ± SD age of  years. One out of every three patients did not have any cardiovascular comorbidities, whereas the others had known cardiovascular comorbidities. Of these, the most prevalent were systemic hypertension and a history of tobacco use.The most common presenting symptom that led to the diagnosis of congenitally absent circumflex artery was chest pain. Chest pain on exertion was documented in 59% of the cases; however, these patients did not have any angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease. The etiology of chest pain in these patients is not clearly understood. One of the explanations offered in literature is a steal phenomenon during exertion, where there may be transient ischemia in territories fed by the RCA and LAD due to the diversion of blood flow to anatomical regions usually fed by the left circumflex artery [3].Uniquely our patient had T wave inversions in the inferior leads and occasional PVCs which led to an ECHO that showed reduced ejection fraction and distinct regional wall motion abnormalities in the territory supplied by the LCX or RCA. This led to the angiogram and the diagnosis of an absent LCX artery. Echocardiograms were reported in 11/21 (52.4%) patients in the review. Apart from our patient, the other 2 patients who had reduced ejection fraction with regional wall motion abnormalities were those with underlying coronary artery disease. The exact etiology of our patients reduced ejection fraction, which was confirmed on the cardiac MRI, was unclear given that he had viable myocardium and no underlying coronary artery disease. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) have not been reported as an associated finding in patients with left circumflex anomaly; however, our patient continues to have them despite beta blocker therapy. It is unclear if the PVCs are related to his underlying coronary anomaly.Percutaneous coronary angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the coronary arteries were the two main diagnostic modalities reported. Like the present case, 12 other patients were diagnosed with a coronary angiography, 3 with cardiac CT and 5 using a combination of coronary angiography and an aortogram. Coronary angiography is the preferred imaging technique for coronary artery evaluation; however, multislice 3D coronary CT has proven to be equally beneficial given its noninvasive nature and three-dimensional view. A combination of both imaging methods obviously gives a more robust assessment of coronary arteries and their neighboring structures [13].Patients with a congenitally absent LCX usually have a superdominant RCA as an anatomical compensation for blood supply to areas of the heart usually supplied by the LCX. This was evident in our case and was reported in 90.4% of the entire cohort. In addition to the absent LCX, other concomitant congenital abnormalities described so far are (i) atretic mid LAD originating from the sinus of Valsalva, (ii) dual LAD, (iii) LAD originating from the right coronary cusps, and (iv) nonexisting left subclavian artery [10, 15, 19].The absence of a LCX is usually regarded as a benign condition that does not require lesion specific intervention [12]. Rather, management per guideline directed medical therapy is recommended. None of the 21 cases reviewed reported any negative outcome associated with the absent LCX. Of the entire cohort, 4 (19%) patients were diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with clinically significant stenotic lesions in the remaining blood vessels on angiogram. These patients, however, had significant comorbidities that predisposed them to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.Congenital absence of the left circumflex coronary artery is a rare, relatively benign condition that does not require lesion specific treatment. It presents most commonly with chest pain and may be associated with EKG abnormalities. Definitive diagnosis is usually made by cardiac CTA or coronary angiogram.The authors certify that they have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest or nonfinancial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.
A Rare Manifestation of Asymptomatic Ebstein’s Anomaly with Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis
Maricopa Integrated Health System, 2601 E. Roosevelt St., Phoenix, AZ 85008, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Carmel Moazez; moc.liamg@zezaomcReceived 18 August 2017; Accepted 17 October 2017; Published 25 October 2017Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2017 Carmel Moazez et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Ebstein’s anomaly is a rare congenital heart disease that presents with apical displacement of the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve. It has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and has been shown to manifest itself any time from birth to adulthood. Our patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of intravenous heroin abuse who presented to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. He denied any prior cardiac history. A transthoracic echo showed normal left ventricular function, but a large 2.2 × 2.1 cm echodensity on the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve consistent with vegetation with severe tricuspid regurgitation and probable leaflet perforation. It also demonstrated severe right heart enlargement with atrialization of the right ventricle and apical displacement of the tricuspid valve consistent with Ebstein’s anomaly. This is a rare case of an adult who presented with asymptomatic Ebstein’s anomaly. There have been few reports of tricuspid valve endocarditis with Ebstein’s anomaly in the literature. To our knowledge, this represents the fifth reported case of a new diagnosis of Ebstein’s anomaly in the setting of endocarditis and the second case of Ebstein’s anomaly and endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser.Ebstein’s anomaly is a rare congenital heart disease that presents with apical displacement of the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve. The incidence of Ebstein’s anomaly is about 1 per 200,000 live births [1]. It has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and has been shown to manifest itself any time from birth to adulthood. When it presents in adulthood, it will typically present with symptomatic arrhythmia, usually tachycardia, or right or left sided heart failure [2].On exam, patients will present with murmur of tricuspid regurgitation, widely split first heart sound, and jugular venous distention. Forty-seven percent of adult patients with Ebstein’s anomaly have cyanosis due to increased right atrial pressure from tricuspid regurgitation. Electrocardiogram findings in Ebstein’s anomaly include tall and peaked p waves, widened QRS with or without right bundle branch block, and qR pattern in leads V1–V4. Transthoracic echocardiogram is the test of choice for diagnosing Ebstein’s anomaly [3].It has been thought that Ebstein’s anomaly with tricuspid regurgitation can predispose a person to tricuspid valve endocarditis, but very few cases in the literature have shown this. Rarely will Ebstein’s anomaly remain undetected into late adulthood and present as an incidental finding [2].The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of intravenous heroin abuse who presented to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. He had shortness of breath and leg swelling for one month, which worsened in the past week. He also complained of fever, chills, chronic cough, pleuritic chest pain, and abdominal pain. Previously he had been able to walk indefinitely, but at this time he could only walk a few steps before becoming fatigued. He denied taking any medications and denied drug allergies. He denied history of surgeries. He had never been hospitalized. He denied cardiac history and ever having been “blue” as a child. His mother was an alcoholic and likely used lithium, which he believed were continued during pregnancy. He had lost contact with his biological mother. He had a 30-pack year smoking history and admitted to using intravenous heroin just prior to admission. He reused needles and tested negative for HIV and hepatitis one year prior to admission.Exam on presentation was significant for a man in moderate distress. He had a 2/6 holosystolic heart murmur heard best at the left sternal border and apex, which increased with respiration. He also had right upper quadrant tenderness, Murphy’s sign positive, and 3+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. No splinter hemorrhages, Osler nodes, or Janeway lesions were visualized.The patient was hypotensive, hypoxic, tachycardic, and tachypneic on admission. Electrocardiogram was consistent with right bundle branch block with QRS duration 124 ms. Pertinent labs included white blood cell count 33.6 k/uL, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 3,517 pg/mL, hemoglobin 10.5 g/dL with MCV 79.9 fl, HIV screening test negative, hepatitis C antibody positive, and urine drug screen positive for barbiturates.He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit and started on vancomycin and zosyn for endocarditis. Blood cultures were drawn prior to starting antibiotics, which grew Streptococcus oralis. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function with ejection fraction 55–60%, a large 2.2 × 2.1 cm echodensity on the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve consistent with a vegetation with severe tricuspid regurgitation, and probable leaflet perforation. Figures 1–3 show different views of the large vegetation that was visualized. Echocardiogram also showed severe right heart enlargement with atrialization of the right ventricle and apical displacement of the tricuspid valve consistent with Ebstein’s anomaly, which can be seen in Figures 1 and 4. Interatrial septum appeared intact with color flow Doppler, which can be visualized in Figure 5. A computerized tomography (CT) chest scan showed septic pulmonary emboli, and he was started on intravenous heparin. The patient was stabilized and transferred to a higher-level care center for tricuspid valve repair.This is a rare case of an adult who presented with asymptomatic Ebstein’s anomaly. To our knowledge, this represents the fifth reported case of a new diagnosis of Ebstein’s anomaly in the setting of endocarditis and the second case of Ebstein’s anomaly and endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser [2, 4, 5]. The other case of Ebstein’s anomaly and endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser was in a 19-year-old patient who presented much younger than our patient [4]. The other two cases were pacemaker endocarditis [2, 6]. Our patient presented with endocarditis secondary to intravenous drug abuse, and Ebstein’s anomaly was an incidental finding on transthoracic echocardiogram. His baseline anatomical abnormality of his tricuspid valve from his undiagnosed Ebstein’s anomaly may have contributed to the development of his endocarditis.Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography is the diagnostic test of choice for Ebstein’s anomaly. Typical findings include apical displacement of the proximal attachment of the septal and posterior tricuspid valve leaflets greater than 8 mm/m2 body surface area or 1.2 cm in length, redundancy and fenestrations of the anterior tricuspid valve leaflet, and dilation of the anatomic tricuspid valve annulus at the atrioventricular junction [2, 3, 7]. These findings will cause decreased function of the right ventricle, dilation of the right atrium, and dilation of the right ventricle in addition to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias [8].Fifty percent of patients who present in adulthood will have cyanosis, but this patient had no history of cardiac issues or cyanosis. Very rarely will a patient with Ebstein’s anomaly survive into adulthood with no symptoms. Ebstein’s anomaly has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation, which can range from death in a neonate to mild symptoms in an elderly person. Elderly patients who are found to have Ebstein’s anomaly usually have milder forms and a better overall prognosis. Further, studies have shown that elderly patients will usually present with arrhythmias, likely supraventricular tachycardia. Paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias are a common cause of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class deterioration [7]. NYHA class I and II patients can be managed medically, while class III and IV will likely require surgical intervention [8]. Patients can also present with sudden cardiac death related to a conduction abnormality causing atrial fibrillation with preexcitation [3].It is known that intravenous drug abuse predisposes patients to tricuspid valve endocarditis, but it is unknown whether Ebstein’s anomaly also predisposes a patient to tricuspid valve endocarditis [4]. It is also thought that Ebstein’s anomaly with tricuspid regurgitation predisposes patients to infective endocarditis [2]. More cases will need to be studied to determine this risk.Ebstein’s anomaly is a rare congenital anomaly that very rarely remains undetected into late adulthood. Our case describes a 43-year-old male with a history of intravenous heroin abuse found to have tricuspid valve endocarditis with an incidental finding of Ebstein’s anomaly. There have been few reported cases of tricuspid valve endocarditis with Ebstein’s anomaly in the literature. To our knowledge, this represents the fifth reported case of Ebstein’s anomaly in the setting of endocarditis and the second case of Ebstein’s anomaly and endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Deglutition Syncope: Two Case Reports Attributed to Vagal Hyperactivity
Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Sukhdeep Bhogal; ude.uste@lagohbReceived 20 April 2017; Accepted 22 August 2017; Published 25 October 2017Academic Editor: Manabu ShirotaniCopyright © 2017 Sukhdeep Bhogal et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Deglutition syncope is a relatively rare cause of syncope that belongs to the category of neurally mediated reflex syncopal syndromes. The phenomenon is related to vagal reflex in context to deglutition causing atrioventricular block and acute reduction in cardiac output leading to dizziness or syncope. We present case series of two cases of deglutition syncope, of which first was managed medically and second with pacemaker implantation.Deglutition syncope (DS) is a relatively uncommon cause of syncope. Since the first reported case of swallow syncope in 1793 by Spens [1], there have been around 100 case reports published in the literature [2]. The usual presentation includes either presyncopal symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or overt syncope. It is more commonly seen in adult males [3]. The entity has been described to be associated with various esophageal disorders such as esophageal spasm, stricture, achalasia, hiatal hernia, and esophageal cancer [3–6]. However, the presence of functional and structural disorders of the esophagus is not mandatory for the diagnosis, as reported in many cases [7–9]. Besides this, almost 15% cases were associated with cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction, [10] and in approximately 39% cases, the etiology or association remained unknown [11].A 68-year-old woman with a history of recently diagnosed glomerulonephritis, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was admitted with episodes of presyncope and dizziness. Her family history was unremarkable for arrhythmias or syncope. On admission, her heart rate (HR) was 54 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure was 166/94 mmHg with no evidence of orthostatic hypotension. Her home medications include amlodipine, losartan, and metoprolol tartrate (12.5 mg twice daily) for high blood pressure. The remainder of the physical examination including a comprehensive neurological examination was normal. Hematological and biochemical tests were unremarkable. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia with first degree atrioventricular block. Her echocardiogram and computed tomography of the head and neck were unremarkable as well. She was treated symptomatically with fluids. On the second day of admission, she had a syncopal spell with a 6.2 second pause, resulting in an atrial escape with failed conduction to ventricles, followed by restoration of sinus rhythm (sinus arrhythmia) which was noted on telemetry (Figure 1) while swallowing her pills. The symptoms were reproduced by making her swallow cracker when her HR dropped from 66 bpm to 38 bpm, and she had another 3.8 second pause. Gastroenterology workup including a barium swallow showed small-sized hiatal hernia. She opted for medical management to be initiated with and was started on proton pump inhibitor with discontinuation of metoprolol. She had no more recurrence of symptoms while swallowing during her hospital stay. She was discharged with an event monitor and close cardiology follow-up. She continues to have syncopal episodes but reports incidence has decreased.A 59-year-old male presented to the hospital with recurrent episodes of lightheadedness while swallowing. He reports having several episodes of lightheadedness over the last thirteen years that have been occurring more frequently lately. He did not seek medical attention initially as episodes were occurring once or twice a year. However, over the past six months, he has been having these episodes at least once a month and had syncope during two of these episodes. He correlated these episodes with liquid diet only. His past medical history was insignificant, and he was not taking any medication. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. On admission, he was afebrile and had a blood pressure of 105/45 mmHg and a HR of 75 bpm. Physical examination including comprehensive neurological examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests were normal. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial complexes. Echocardiogram demonstrated normal EF of 55–60% with no evidence of diastolic dysfunction on Doppler filling pattern. Computed tomography of the head was unremarkable as well. Barium swallow did not show any organic disorder of the esophagus. Considering unexplained and infrequent symptoms, the patient underwent implantable loop recorder placement procedure. Prior to discharge, he had another episode of syncope with a 5-second pause (Figure 2) noted on the loop recorder while drinking water. He was diagnosed with deglutition syncope and considered as a candidate for permanent pacemaker implantation. Following pacemaker implantation, he remains asymptomatic on six-month follow-up.The exact pathophysiology of DS remains unknown; several mechanisms have been postulated in the literature. In general, it is related to vagal reflex in context to deglutition causing temporary suppression of cardiovascular function. The mechanoreceptor in the esophagus is sensitive to stretch distension, and when activated, the signal is sent to the brainstem via the esophageal plexus [12]. The efferent signals are then mediated by right and left vagus nerves which innervate sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, respectively. Consequently, it leads to temporary bradyarrhythmias and sometimes a reduction in cardiac output causing hypotension via peripheral vasodilatation [11, 13]. Arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia and atrial or ventricular asystole have been observed as well. Tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation have also been reported with DS [14, 15].The diagnosis of DS involves obtaining careful history and recognition of syncopal or presyncopal symptoms with the specific type of meals. This can be further supported by provocative testing with food or other triggers [16]. Also, it is imperative to rule out any functional or organic esophageal disorder [11] with the barium swallow or endoscopy. After ruling out esophageal causes, cardiac workup should be considered which includes ECG, echocardiography, and an event monitor or inpatient telemetry to catch the symptomatic events [3], as done in our cases.Various treatment options are available for DS. It is important to identify and avoid triggers before proceeding to medical management or pacemaker implantation. Certain foods such as carbonated drinks which are known to distend gastric lumen and triggering vagal response and resulting bradycardia should be avoided [2]. As there was no triggering factors and no functional or organic disorder of the esophagus (besides small hiatal hernia) present in our first case, medical management with discontinuation of beta blockers was considered. Discontinuation of medications that slow cardiac conduction such as beta blockers as well as which facilitate vasodepression such as angiotensin blockades or receptor inhibitors is considered as the mainstay of therapy [3] before proceeding with permanent pacemaker insertion. Furthermore, anticholinergic medications such as atropine can be used to prevent bradyarrhythmias secondary to vagal stimulation. Also, sympathomimetic agents like isoprenaline which was used to treat DS can be tried; however, their efficacy has not been well studied and use is also limited by their side effects [11]. Pacemaker implantation should be considered in patients who remain symptomatic even after avoiding triggering factors and withdrawing the potential culprit medications [11], which was considered in our second case resulting in resolution of syncopal events. As most of the workup was negative for any organic or functional disorder of the esophagus, high vagal tone during deglutition likely represents the mechanism of DS in both cases. Also, it may be worth to consider precautions such as avoidance of driving or operating heavy machinery while medical therapy is being tried or diagnosis is in question [17].DS is a rare cause of syncope with limited data in the literature based on case reports, which can cause significant impairment in quality of life. Successful management involves careful history, avoidance of triggers if they are identified, removal of any potential atrioventricular nodal blocking medications, and the trial of sympathomimetic agents if well tolerated, and if all else fails, it needs pacemaker implantation.Case 1 was presented as an abstract presentation in the American College of Cardiology meeting.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Right Atrial Fibroelastoma Presenting as Typical Atrial Flutter: Rare Disease in Unusual Location
Department of Cardiology, Saint Joseph’s Regional Medical Center, 703 Main St, Paterson, NJ 07503, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Ahmad Abuarqoub; moc.liamtoh@6adamhaReceived 21 June 2017; Revised 31 August 2017; Accepted 10 September 2017; Published 10 October 2017Academic Editor: Gianluca Di BellaCopyright © 2017 Ahmad Abuarqoub et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Typical atrial flutter as initial presentation of papillary fibroelastoma involving the cavotricuspid isthmus is not described before in literature. To our knowledge only 14 cases have been reported in literature involving the right atrium. Very unusual location is at the junction between inferior vena cava (IVC) and right atria as only 1 case has been reported.59-year-old African American heavy smoking male with past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia presented to our facility with sudden onset of palpitations, which were rapid and irregular and started 1 day prior to presentation associated with increased shortness of breath, and denied any history of orthopnea, PND, chest pain, or lower limb edema. EKG was done and showed typical atrial flutter with variable AV block and rapid ventricular response (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed the left ventricular systolic function 40–45% with right atrial mass possibly a clot extending to right atrial appendage measuring 2 cm × 3.1 cm (Figure 2). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was done for further evaluation of the lesion which showed atrial mass at the conjunction between IVC and right atria (Figure 3). Preoperative cardiac catheterization showed no obstructive coronary artery disease, except for coronary cameral fistula (Figure 4). Surgical excision of the right atrial mass from base of the stalk was done and histopathology of the mass was consistent with PFE (Figure 5). The patient had smooth postoperative course, ablation of the IVC isthmus was not done, hence the atrial arrhythmia was attributed to the compressive effect of the tumor, and the patient maintained sinus rhythm since then. The patient was discharged on anticoagulation; 6-month follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram was done and showed no residual mass.Papillary fibroelastoma (PFE) is the third-most common benign cardiac tumor followed by atrial myxoma and lipoma [1]. They are small, avascular tumors composed of a dense core of connective tissue, an intermediate layer of loose connective tissue, and a superficial layer of hyperplastic endothelial cells [2], usually located on the mitral or aortic valvular endocardium (less common on tricuspid and pulmonary valvular endocardium) [3]. Origin from the right atrium is rarely seen, often misdiagnosed as atrial myxoma or thrombus. Cardiac PFEs account for 7% of all cardiac tumors. They are rarely found along the atrial or ventricular walls [4].The pathophysiology of PFEs is controversial. They have been considered to be neoplasms, hamartomas, organized thrombi, and endocardial responses to infection or hemodynamic turbulence leading to endothelial hyperplasia [4].Papillary fibroelastomas are of clinical relevance because of their potential for embolization leading to cardiovascular and neurological embolic-like symptoms when arising from the left side of the heart [1, 2, 5]. However, right-sided cardiac tumors remain predominantly asymptomatic until they become large enough to interfere with intracardiac blood flow, alter hemodynamic function, or induce arrhythmias. In addition, paradoxical emboli can occur in the setting of a right to left shunt [2, 5]. This type of mass can be discovered most precisely by TEE as it has sensitivity of 88.9% and specificity of 87.8%. TEE is more sensitive than TTE if tumor size is less than 20 mm. Other diagnostic modalities are computed tomography and gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging [2, 6, 7].Surgical removal of these tumors is debatable. The decision to operate is mainly dependent on the size, location, and mobility of the mass. However, it is almost unanimously agreed upon that surgery is necessary once cardiovascular or neurological symptoms occur. Prior to surgery, the use of prophylactic anticoagulants decreased the risk of systemic embolization [4].Hakemi et al. reviewed 13 reported cases of nonvalvular right atrial PFE and most of these cases were diagnosed incidentally during routine work-up. Only one additional case was reported since then leaving us with a total of 14 cases of right atrial PFE [8, 9].The unique features of our case are its unusual location at the junction between IVC and right atrium and presenting as typical atrial flutter in regard to its location. The presence of coronary cameral fistula is an incidental finding as it has no association with PFE in literature review. In the setting of large right atrial mass and the presence of atrial arrhythmia surgery was considered. Anticoagulation was given in the setting of CHADS2Vasc score of 2, keeping in mind that the patient did not have any systemic embolic manifestations from the right atrial mass. Repeat echocardiogram did not show any residual mass.Right atrial cardiac papillary fibroelastoma is an extremely rare finding. Only 14 cases have been previously reported in the literature. This is the first report of such a tumor in the junction between right atrium and IVC. Surgical removal of these tumors is a point of debate. However, surgery is recommended in large and symptomatic masses. Anticoagulation is required in patients with systemic embolic manifestations.All authors disclose no conflicts of interest.
D-Shaped Left Ventricle, Anatomic, and Physiologic Implications
1Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital Center, Valhalla, NY, USA2Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital Center, Valhalla, NY, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Eder Hans Cativo Calderon; moc.oohay@navsnahdeReceived 19 May 2017; Revised 18 August 2017; Accepted 7 September 2017; Published 8 October 2017Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2017 Eder Hans Cativo Calderon et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Right ventricular loading/pressure influences left ventricular function because the two ventricles pump in series and because they are anatomically arranged in parallel, sharing the common ventricular septum. Flattening of the interventricular septum detected during echocardiographic examination is called D-shaped left ventricle. We present a case of an elderly male of African descent, who presented with increased shortness of breath. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed flattening and left sided deviation of interventricular septum causing a decreased size in left ventricle, secondary to volume/pressure overload in the right ventricle. While patient received hemodialysis therapy and intravascular volume was removed, patient blood pressure was noted to increase, paradox. Repeated transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated less left deviation of interventricular septum compared with previous echocardiogram. We consider that it is important for all physicians to be aware of the anatomic and physiologic implication of D-shaped left ventricle and how right ventricle pressure/volume overload affects its function and anatomy.Pulmonary hypertension (PH) frequently occurs in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) [1, 2]. Patients with PH may have right ventricular pressure overload manifested as abnormal motion of the interventricular septum, which can be observed on echocardiography [3]. The left ventricle becomes D-shaped, which is a sign of increased preload in the right ventricle (RV) displacing the septum toward the left. Septal flattening is best appreciated in the short-axis view at the level of papillary muscles (basal or mid-left ventricle).This is an 87-year-old African male who presented to the Emergency Department complaining of increase shortness of breath after missing 2 sessions of hemodialysis. Past medical history includes end stage renal disease on hemodialysis therapy, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, permanent atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, and pericardial effusion with placement of pericardial window. Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 117/59 mmHg, heart rate of 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 per minute, O2 sat of 96% on room air, and temperature of 37°C. There were internal jugular vein distention, irregular heart sounds, and basilar lung crackles bilaterally. Electrocardiogram (EKG) confirmed atrial fibrillation and right ventricle hypertrophy with right axis deviation. There were normal QRS voltage and complexes, T waves, and ST segments. Laboratory data were remarkable for troponin I 0.04 ng/ml (normal < 0.02 ng/ml), pro-brain natriuretic peptide 108,187 pg/ml, potassium 3.4 mmol/Lt, creatinine 2.8 mg/dl, hemoglobin 11.4 g/dl, total bilirubin 1.41 mg/dl, and albumin 3.1 gr/dl. Cardiomegaly and blunting of the right and left cost phrenic angles were evident on chest X-ray.Patient was admitted to medical intensive care unit (MICU) for fluid overload secondary to missing hemodialysis therapy and severe pulmonary hypertension. While in MICU, transthoracic echocardiogram was done, which revealed normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction > 55%) and severe tricuspid regurgitation (coronary sinus and right atrium were noted to be dilated, and a small loculated pericardial effusion was seen behind the right atrium, with no evidence of cardiac tamponade. Right ventricular systolic pressure was elevated at >60 mm Hg, consistent with severe pulmonary hypertension, and flattening of the interventricular septum (D-shaped left ventricle) with RV overload (Figure 1).Shortly thereafter, renal service was consulted and hemodialysis was initiated. Vital signs were recorded and reviewed, while the patient was undergoing hemodialysis therapy, as is illustrated on Table 1, the blood pressure trended up continuously as volume was being removed.After hemodialysis session, the patient’s shortness of breath improved and blood pressure trended up instead down as we may expect in normal individuals after removing intravascular volume. Transthoracic echocardiogram was repeated and demonstrated less left deviation of interventricular septum compared with previous echocardiogram (Figure 2).Upon discharge, the patient was seen in pulmonary clinic and cardiology clinic as an outpatient at one week and two-month follow-up. He was doing well with improvement of baseline shortness breath and adherence with hemodialysis therapy.We are describing this case of severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) in an end stage renal disease (ESRD) patient associated with increased right ventricular volume and pressure causing interventricular motion abnormalities demonstrated on echocardiography and paradoxical blood pressure changes after hemodialysis.PH can be due to a primary elevation of pressure in the pulmonary arterial system alone (pulmonary arterial hypertension; precapillary PH) or secondary to elevations of pressure in the pulmonary venous and pulmonary capillary systems (pulmonary venous hypertension; postcapillary PH). Chronic kidney disease has been associated with development of PH, included in group 5 pulmonary hypertension (multifactorial) as defined by the World Health Organization [4, 5]. It has been suggested that metabolic and hormonal changes in ESRD patients may lead to pulmonary artery stenosis and also pulmonary vascular resistance, ultimately leading to PH. Thus, the etiology of PH in ESRD patients undergoing prolonged hemodialysis may be multifactorial [6].Echocardiography is an important tool that can easily make an early diagnosis of RV dysfunction and PH, and it also can be very helpful in selecting an appropriate treatment approach to prevent progression of RV dysfunction [7].Acute and chronic alterations in right ventricular loading influence left ventricular function because the two ventricles pump in series and they are anatomically arranged in parallel, sharing the common ventricular septum (Figure 3(a)). Under these conditions, during the end-diastolic phase there is a leftward displacement of the interventricular septum producing deformity of the short-axis profile of the left ventricle [8] (Figure 3(b)). Systolic overload of the right ventricle produces an inversion of the normal left to right transventricular septal systolic pressure differential. These changes are reversible, as demonstrated by echocardiographic studies of ventricular septal curvature after hemodynamic resolution of acute pressure or volume overload [9] (Figure 3(c)).In normal circumstances, RV pressure is equal to the pressure in the pulmonary artery. Typically, in RV pressure overload the RV free wall is hypokinetic and is best appreciated from parasternal long axis projections. Normally, the shape of the LV cavity will be circular because of the higher LV pressure throughout the cardiac cycle. However, in the presence of RV pressure overload, such as pulmonary hypertension, the interventricular septum will shift towards the LV and the septum will appear flattened during systole, which is best visualized on the parasternal short-axis view, just below the mitral valve. The higher the RV pressure is, the further the septum will displace into the LV resulting in a D-shaped LV cavity (Figure 3(b)). Of note, septal flattening in the presence of elevated RV pressure should be distinguished from (isolated) RV volume overload, which leads to a septal flattening during diastole [10].The most common causes of RV volume overload are tricuspid and/or pulmonary regurgitation in the presence of various cardiac pathologies. RV volume overload leads to increase size and expansion of RV; these changes not only produce a displacement of the interventricular septum posteriorly during diastole but also change the shape of the septum and left ventricle. Further, although vigorous contraction of the right ventricle does appear to contribute in some cases to the anterior systolic motion of the septum, the major factor causing paradoxical septal motion appears to be the change in ventricular shape from diastole to systole [11].Flattening of the interventricular septum detected during echocardiographic examination is called D-shaped left ventricle (Figure 3(b)). D-shaped left ventricle evidenced during systole (particularly end-systole) suggests RV pressure overload, whereas a D-shaped ventricle in diastole suggests RV volume overload. Septal flattening is best appreciated in the short-axis view at the level of the basal or mid-left ventricle. If severe TR coexists with pulmonary hypertension, combined RV pressure and volume overload results in septal flattening occurring in both systole and diastole. Since diastolic interventricular septal flattening represents relative RV and LV filling, an RV overload pattern may be manifest in the setting of mitral stenosis and less severe forms of TR.Our patient initially was admitted due to worsening shortness of breath secondary to chronic severe pulmonary hypertension and volume overload after missing two hemodialysis sessions. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe tricuspid regurgitation, dilated coronary sinus, dilated right atrium, and marked deviation of the interventricular septum into left ventricle.In healthy individuals, when intravascular volume is decreased, preload decreases, which, in turn, decreases cardiac output and produces a drop in blood pressure. Our patient presented with severe pulmonary hypertension, volume overload, and right ventricle dilation. In some circumstances such as cardiac tamponade and right ventricle myocardial infarction, intravenous fluid (usually isotonic saline) should be given to patients with evidence of low cardiac output (hypotension, hypoperfusion, and a low or normal jugular venous [JVP] pressure) who do not have pulmonary congestion or evidence of right heart failure. Our patient demonstrates RV pressure and volume overload with acute decompensation of right ventricle function (right ventricle failure) in these circumstances volume removal will improve right ventricle function and cardiac output.As the right ventricle is exposed to increased pressure and volume overloaded, there is a resultant displacement of interventricular septum, leading to decreased size of the left ventricle producing a decline in cardiac output. While the patient was on hemodialysis therapy and fluid was being removed, volume overload in the right ventricle decreased, causing a reduction in RV size and subsequent displacement of the interventricular septum toward the left ventricle. This allowed the left ventricle to expand, fill, and contract better, increasing cardiac output (cardiac output = heart rate × stroke volume) as evidenced by a rising blood pressure. In normal individuals after removing intravascular volume, a decline can be expected in blood pressure, as we illustrated in our patient this effect is paradoxical in those patients with increased right ventricle pressure and volume overload. These findings can be confirmed by echocardiography changes evidenced after hemodialysis, showing decreased displacement of interventricular septum into left ventricle. Although initial right ventricular hypertrophy may be adaptive, in chronic overload states the remodeling process ultimately affects and perhaps irreversibly damages left ventricular function leading to overall decreased cardiac output. We do not recommend to routinely remove fluid in patients who are experiencing RV dysfunction; the decision should be individualized to each patient.Basic physiology and anatomic relation of left and right ventricle is sometimes forgotten. Thus, it is important for our daily practice to acknowledge how anatomic and physiologic changes on right ventricle may affect left ventricle and normal heart functioning.More insight into right ventricular hypertrophy and remodeling needs to be determined for developing potential new therapeutics and for improving prognosis.Patient’s consent was obtained.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Parachute-Like Mitral Valve Tuberculoma: A Rare Presentation

The spectrum of clinical presentations of tuberculous cardiac involvements includes incidental detection of single and multiple well-circumscribed tuberculomas, symptomatic obstructive lesions, AV conduction abnormalities, and even sudden death. We present a case of cardiac tuberculoma in an immune-competent person who presented with worsening dyspnea. The unique morphology of this mass posed an imaging challenge that required 4-dimensional (4D) echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) detail to differentiate the mass from an anterior mitral leaflet (AML) aneurysm. Histological examination after surgical resection confirmed its tuberculous etiology. Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of infectious diseases and death in developing countries [1]. There have been anecdotal reports of tuberculous cardiac involvements including valvular and endocardial lesions, myocarditis, pericarditis, and adjacent extracardiac masses. Tuberculous endocarditis has largely been reported in patients with military tuberculosis or after valve replacement in whom the used valves were already contaminated [2–6]. Here we present a case of cardiac tuberculosis in an immunocompetent patient with isolated cardiac involvement in form of a growth involving mitral valve. Its unique appearance made it an imaging challenge until postoperative histological diagnosis could be made.A 38-year-old male presented with worsening dyspnea and gradual weight loss for 9 months. Physical examination revealed a pansystolic apical murmur radiating to axilla with expiratory accentuation. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a rounded, hollow, parachute-shaped mass in left atrium (LA) near mitral valve leaflets. On initial impression, the mass looked like an aneurysmal deformation of myxomatous AML. However, careful examination on 4D echocardiography delineated the structure as a separate entity from AML. It was hollow, parachute-shaped, mainly tethered to AML and partially to posterior leaflet and adjoining posterior wall of LA (Figure 1). The mass interfered with physiological functioning of mitral valve leading to significant mitral regurgitation (MR). Color Doppler examination revealed a systolic jet both into the cavity of this mass and into the LA (Figure 2). CMR of the structure was carried out to further delineate the mass and assess the possibility of anterior mitral leaflet aneurysm that was ruled out, supporting the 4D echocardiographic morphological description (Figures 3 and 4).Surgical resection of the mass was decided due to significant MR and persistent symptoms. Left atrial approach was taken to expose the mass and its perioperative evaluation was carried out that matched with the consensus morphology on preoperative imaging assessments (Figure 5). Following complete resection of the growth, mitral valve could not be adequately repaired and was replaced by metallic prosthesis. Further postsurgical course was uneventful and a significant improvement in functional capacity was noted. Histological evaluation of tissue sample from the growth revealed areas of caseous necrosis with Langhans giant cells (Figure 6). Standard antituberculous regimen was initiated and continued.The scientific evidence for cardiac tuberculosis dates back to reports by Maurocordat (1664) and Morgagni (1761) [7]. Postmortem series have documented low frequencies of cardiac tuberculomas in the range of around 0.3% among all tuberculosis patients [8, 9]. Isolated cardiac tuberculomas are even rare [10]. A variety of patterns have been described for cardiac tuberculosis ranging from single to multiple well-circumscribed tuberculomas, most commonly in right sided chambers [11]. There have been sporadic reports of large tuberculous masses including a large right atrial mass leading to tricuspid stenosis in the recent pass [12]. The spectrum of clinical presentations of tuberculous cardiac masses ranges from asymptomatic incidental findings to symptomatic AV conduction abnormalities [10, 13, 14], right ventricular outflow obstruction [15], caval obstructions [2], and even sudden death [16].Pericardial involvement, the commonest manifest of cardiac tuberculosis in developing nations, is mostly diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiographic findings in the background of clinical picture. Specific histopathological or culture diagnosis is very occasionally required. In contrast, not only are myocardial and endocardial involvements uncommon, but they frequently require histological or cultural evidences in addition to imaging modalities due to lack of specific recognized morphological patterns. Although both histological pattern and Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining are specific for diagnosis, the latter often fails in revealing acid fast bacilli and a definitive diagnosis is made based on typical histological pattern [17].Given the lack of specific morphological patterns of cardiac tuberculomas, echocardiographic diagnosis is often challenging. The morphological patterns may bear close resemblance to other echogenic intracardiac masses like vegetations, tumors, and aneurysms. A similar diagnostic dilemma was experienced in our case where an initial impression of AML aneurysm needed clarification with 4D and CMR imaging. A conclusive diagnosis could only be made after histological evidence of typical tuberculous morphology following surgical resection. A combination of challenging anatomical detail and rarity of tuberculous etiology made this case unique.All the authors hereby disclose that they do not have any potential conflicts of interest to mention.
Postintervention Dyspnea after Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation: Think of a Phrenic Nerve Injury

Ramos-Villalobos et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Phrenic nerve injury (PNI) is a rare complication of catheter ablation therapy, most commonly observed in cryoablation of the right side pulmonary veins. We present a case of PNI after radiofrequency catheter ablation that developed acute dyspnea 24 hours after the intervention. Dyspnea is the main symptom of PNI, so the diagnosis should always be suspected if it appears after any type of catheter ablation involving the trajectory of the phrenic nerve. There is no specific treatment for PNI. The only maneuver that has been reported to accelerate the recovery of PNI is early stopping of the ablation therapy.Phrenic nerve injury (PNI) is a rare complication of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation [1]. Its prevalence is higher with cryoablation (approximately 5%) than radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA; less than 1%) and therefore the development of diaphragmatic paralysis is monitored during the former procedure [2]. Although most cases of diaphragmatic paralysis show full recovery, it could be a potentially disabling complication [3]. We report a case of diaphragmatic paralysis secondary to PNI in the context of an uneventful RFCA of pulmonary veins, manifested as acute dyspnea 24 hours after the intervention.A 51-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension, bypass surgery, and obesity underwent RFCA of the pulmonary veins due to paroxysmal AF. Under conscious sedation, Lasso and Cordis 7-Fr catheters were used to map the left atrium and pulmonary veins (EnSite electroanatomic mapping system, St. Jude Medical, USA). Energy applied was limited to a power of 20 W achieving maximum temperature of 45°C. Radiofrequency applications, a total of 531 points giving 340 points to both right pulmonary veins, had an average length of 3 to 4 minutes per vein resulting in elimination of pulmonary vein action potentials (Figure 1). As routinely for RFCA, no phrenic nerve stimulation was performed during ablation of right pulmonary veins. During the procedure and immediate postoperative period the patient did not have any symptoms. The following day, on prone position and under routine supplementary oxygen she reported mild dyspnea that increased with sitting. Without supplementary oxygen, she developed oxygen desaturation of 85%. Pulmonary physical exploration showed absence of breathing sounds at the right base. Chest radiograph showed elevated right hemidiaphragm (Figure 2). ECG confirmed sinus rhythm and the echocardiogram was normal. The diagnosis of diaphragmatic dysfunction secondary to RFCA was made. The patient did not require noninvasive mechanical ventilation. She experienced complete recovery of symptoms with pulmonary physical therapy. Asymptomatic paralysis persisted in a 10-month follow-up (Figure 3).PNI in the context of RFCA has been reported in ablation of pulmonary veins (mostly right but also left) and ablation of superior vena cava (SVC) [4] and even in inappropriate sinus tachycardia [5]. The occurrence of PNI during RFCA for AF has been limited to case reports [6] and its prevalence in the context of RFCA for AF is low (0.48%) with a reported permanent damage of 0.17% [7]. It has been reported to occur more frequently in patients that underwent wide-area circumferential ablation whereas Yong reported an incidence of 30% [8]. The most common scenario in which PNI has been reported is cryoballoon ablation of the right-sided pulmonary veins. This has been observed in 8 to 11% of cryoablation procedures and was largely reversible. The mechanism of the occurrence of PNI is probably related to positioning the balloon further into the right pulmonary veins, as the phrenic nerve may run behind the right atrium. Such is the case as the undersizing of the balloon to a 23-mm versus a 28-mm balloon relative to the size of the vein that could contribute to this complication [9].Three mechanisms might have been implicated in PNI: (1) direct heat transfer from the catheter contact site to the nerve, regardless of the energy source used for ablation; (2) effect of a high intensity electromagnetic field transiently generated at the catheter tip; (3) generation of a resonance current around the heart; furthermore, the PN is more sensitive to heating than the myocardium [3]. Sánchez-Quintana et al. described the close relationship between the atrial tissue surrounding the right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV) at its inferoanterior area, the RSPV, and the SVC with the phrenic nerve (Figure 3). Right Phrenic Nerve (RPN) descends vertically from its origin and continues along the right anterolateral surface SVC. Descending down the anterolateral wall of SVC, it turns posteriorly as it approaches the superior cavoatrial junction and follows in close proximity to the right-sided pulmonary veins. It is separated by only the pericardium at the anterolateral junction between the SVC and the right atrium. At this level, distance between the RSPV and RPN on an average is between 0 and 2.3 mm; in 6 specimens (32%) the RSPV is located <2 mm from RPN [10]. The closer relationship of the RPN to the RSPV makes it more susceptible to injury during ablation of the RSPV than during ablation of the Right Inferior Pulmonary Vein (RIPV). Ablation to achieve pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has been highly successful in the management of AF. However, it is also associated with a variety of complications including PNI. The anatomic course of the phrenic nerve near the RSPV predisposes them to injury during the ablation.Up to 31% of patients remain asymptomatic, but diaphragmatic dysfunction is an underdiagnosed cause of dyspnea and should always be considered as a differential diagnosis. Although dyspnea remains the cardinal symptom, the severity of it can vary depending on coexisting conditions such as obesity, weakness of other muscle groups, or underlying heart and lung disease, especially when they are supine [1]. Physical exploration reveals tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and decreased diaphragmatic excursion can be detected by percussion of the lower rib cage at end expiration and end inspiration. The most characteristic physical sign is abdominal paradox, which is paradoxical inward motion of the abdomen as the rib cage expands during inspiration especially in supine position, and when this occurs in unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, it suggests generalized weakness of the respiratory muscles. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a number of tests but the easiest one is the chest X-ray which shows elevated hemidiaphragm and basal subsegmental atelectasis [11]. Dyspnea could be resolved only with supplementary oxygen but, in some cases with severe respiratory distress, patients may require a few days of ventilatory support with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or even invasive mechanical ventilation.Early detection of PNI with phrenic nerve pacing is now the standard procedure during cryoablation in order to detect PNI earlier, to stop cryotherapy immediately, and to accelerate recovery of the injured nerve. Many strategies have been reported to be useful to avoid PNI in this setting. Some authors have postulated that preprocedural imaging could help to delineate the phrenic nerve course and therefore to avoid a PNI [12, 13]. Horton et al. [14]. reported a novel method of localization of the phrenic nerve with cardiac computed tomography and found that the imaged pericardiophrenic artery could reliably identify the approximate location of the RPN, suggesting that a phrenic nerve location within 10 mm of the RSPV poses a higher risk of PNI using balloon ablation devices. The improved temporal and spatial resolution allowed by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has facilitated the noninvasive assessment of cardiac anatomy before transcatheter electrophysiologic procedures. Clarification of spatial relations of phrenic nerves and key cardiac structures is important to decrease potential complications. The RPN was identified in 50 of 106 patients (47%). In the setting of electrophysiologic interventions, MDCT before a procedure may elucidate anatomic relationships and help minimize inadvertent complications [15]. In animals (rats) proximity of the ablation catheter to the phrenic nerve may be identified by capture during pacing [16]. Balloon inflation in the pericardial space has been described to protect the left phrenic nerve in the setting of epicardial ventricular tachycardia ablation. Nevertheless, techniques to protect the RPN during endocardial atrial ablation procedures have not been well described [17]. The likelihood of PNI associated with ablation using certain energy sources, the clinical course of this complication, and the possibility of recovery of PN function have not been reported [18]. The only parameter that predicts recovery has been the early interruption of the energy delivery. Short term outcomes from published cases are favorable with 81% of patients having a complete recovery after 6-7 months; however the recovery period can be as long as 28 months [1]. PNI has also been reported to occur with other energy sources for catheter ablation. It has been reported with radiofrequency hot balloon in 3.4% of cases and resolved in less than 3 months [19].PNI is an uncommon complication of catheter ablation. It has been reported to be most commonly associated with atrial fibrillation ablation. It is important to consider PNI in the differential diagnosis of acute dyspnea after this intervention. Currently there is no reliable method to predict RPN injury prior to procedure. However, implementing vigorous monitoring of the nerve function can assure early detection and prevent permanent RPN. Because of this, it is very interesting for electrophysiologists and laboratory staffs to be familiar with and recognize this injury at the earliest to mitigate the damage.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.
Coronary Artery Hematoma Treated with Fenestration Using a Novel NSE Alpha® Scoring Balloon
Hokkaido Cardiovascular Hospital, Hokkaido, JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Naohiro Funayama; moc.liamtoh@oan_anufReceived 23 May 2017; Revised 4 August 2017; Accepted 27 August 2017; Published 2 October 2017Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2017 Naohiro Funayama et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The optimal management of coronary intramural hematoma has not been defined. We described a case in which coronary occlusion developed due to an intramural hematoma after percutaneous coronary intervention for mid left circumflex artery (LCX). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) demonstrated the progression of the intramural hematoma and a totally compressed true lumen. Our approach was based on fenestration with a scoring balloon (NSE Alpha, Goodman, Japan), which allowed the deployment of an additional stent to be avoided. In conclusion, this management can be effectively and safely performed.Intramural hematoma after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) occurs in up to 6.7% of cases [1]. Intramural hematoma is defined as an accumulation of blood within the medial space displacing the internal elastic membrane inward and the external elastic membrane outward, with or without identifiable entry or exit points [1]. Further expansion of this mural hematoma may lead to compression of the true lumen of the coronary artery and result in myocardial ischemia or infarction. Bailout management of the hematoma through the use of stenting or fenestration with a cutting or scoring balloon, or chronic total occlusion-dedicated guidewire, has been reported; however, no optimal treatment approach has yet been established. We present an interesting case of a patient who was successfully treated by coronary artery fenestration with scoring balloon angioplasty.An 84-year-old man with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia was admitted to our hospital for the evaluation of chest pain. A twelve-lead electrocardiogram at rest demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm and no significant ST segment change. Coronary angiography revealed severe luminal stenosis of the mid left circumflex artery (Figure 1). We decided to perform elective PCI for the mid-LCX. We started PCI with a 5 Fr Heartrail II IL4 guide catheter and 0.014-inch Runthrough hypercoat guidewire (Terumo, Japan). The lesion was predilated twice with a semicompliant balloon (3.5 × 15 mm); however, distal slippage of the balloon occurred the first time. A 3.5 × 18 mm sirolimus-eluting stent was implanted at the target lesion. Although the final angiography showed residual mild luminal narrowing with a dissection at the distal LCX, there was no limitation of blood flow, so we concluded the procedure (Figure 2).Two hours later, the patient experienced chest pain and his electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevation in leads, II, III, aVF, and V5-6. Emergent angiography revealed occlusion of the distal segment of the LCX (Figure 3). We began the procedure with a 6 Fr back-up guiding catheter and inserted a 0.014-SION blue guidewire (ASAHI INTECC, Japan) into the distal LCX. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) revealed progression of intramural hematoma and a totally compressed true lumen at the distal LCX, a little apart from the distal edge of the stent (Figure 4). We suspected that predilation at the time of the first PCI might have damaged the intima and caused a dissection, leading to the intramural hematoma. It appeared difficult to achieve adequate coverage with stenting as the distal vessel was small and the end of the intramural hematoma could not be detected. We decided to treat the lesion by creating a fenestration between the true lumen and the hematoma and thereby decompressing the hematoma. A novel scoring balloon (NSE Alpha 2.5 × 13 mm, Goodman, Japan) was dilated 5 times at 6 atmospheres in the far distal LCX (Figure 5). IVUS images demonstrated the resolution of the hyperechoic area within the hematoma space; therefore, we considered a reentry to have been created (Figure 6). Angiography showed TIMI-3 flow with a long dissection and the resolution of luminal narrowing (Figure 7). After the procedure, the patient’s complaints and ECG changes were resolved. Cardiac enzymes were increased (creatine kinase (CK) 819). He was discharged in a very good condition and his clinical outcomes were excellent at 1 month after intervention.Intramural hematoma after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) occurs in up to 6.7% of cases. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has also identified intramural hematoma after 3.2% of DES implantation procedures [2]. Intramural hematoma is defined as an accumulation of blood within the medial space displacing the internal elastic membrane inward and the external elastic membrane outward, with or without identifiable entry or exit points [1].The clinical presentations of intramural hematoma depend on the degree of pressure-driven enlargement of the hematoma space, with progressive true lumen compression resulting in myocardial ischemia or infarction [3].It may be difficult to visualize the dissection and hematoma by coronary angiography [4], and IVUS and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be valuable in establishing the correct diagnosis and in planning the management procedure. These images can provide important information on the extension of the hematoma and the decompression of the intramural hematoma after PCI. On IVUS images, an intramural hematoma typically appears as a homogeneous, hyperechoic, crescent-shaped area. The echogenicity of blood depends on the flow rate, red cell aggregation, and fibrin content [1]. In this case, the IVUS initially revealed images typical of an intramural hematoma as described above. However, after dilation with the scoring balloon, the IVUS showed that the hyperechoic area within the hematoma space had been resolved. We considered a reentry to have been created and blood flow in false lumen resumed, with resolution of red blood cell stagnation. OCT with high resolution imaging may enable a more accurate assessment and characterization of intramural hematomas. However, it is necessary to pay close attention not to further extend the hematoma by the injection of contrast medium when using OCT [3].Although there are several management approaches for intramural hematoma, the optimal treatment approach remains controversial. It has already been reported that stenting to restore distal flow in a narrowed vessel is an effective management approach. However, there are some concerns that stenting may cause longitudinal hematoma extension and is associated with an increased rate of restenosis and stent thrombosis [3, 5]. Some studies have reported good results for fenestration using cutting balloons [6], scoring balloons [7], and stiff guidewires [8]. Creating a fenestration between the true lumen and the hematoma leads to a reduction in pressure in the intramural hematoma. In this case, we decided to use a novel scoring balloon to make an “intentional reentry.” The NSE Alpha has 3 longitudinal nylon elements mounted on the balloon surface to prevent balloon slippage during inflation (Figure 8). The triangular elements of the NSE Alpha concentrate a greater degree of pressure on the vessel wall and although the concepts underlying a number of scoring balloon catheters appear to be similar, it seems that NSE Alpha is more effective in lesion dilation than the other scoring balloons due to the higher and sharp elements. Further, the concept of lesion dilation using the NSE Alpha is similar to that of a cutting balloon. However, a cutting balloon is more effective, although it has a limited crossability of the lesion due to the sharp metal microtome blades and risk of coronary rupture. Therefore, it remains possible that dilation with the NSE Alpha affords an effective and safety approach to fenestration. Accurate measurement of the hematoma diameter is necessary to determine the optimal balloon size to enhance the efficacy of the balloon and prevent further injury. In this case, the NSE Alpha diameter was determined based on the IVUS assessment, and we chose an NSE Alpha 2.5 mm, which is larger than the true lumen diameter but smaller than the vessel wall diameter. We also inflated the balloon in a section of the lesion shown to have less plaque by IVUS assessment in order to easily demonstrate the scoring efficacy.Fenestration with an optimal scoring balloon based on IVUS measurement is an effective approach to the management of intramural hematoma and eliminates the need for the unnecessary deployment of a stent.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Epoetin Alfa: A Cause of Coronary Artery Thrombosis
1Lakeview Medical Center, Marshfield Clinic, Rice Lake, WI, USA2Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, Englewood, NJ, USA3DOW Medical College, Karachi, PakistanCorrespondence should be addressed to Muhammad Umer Siddiqui; moc.liamg@remu.iqiddisReceived 5 June 2017; Accepted 10 August 2017; Published 1 October 2017Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2017 Muhammad Umer Siddiqui et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Introduction. Epoetin alfa is an erythrocyte-stimulating factor. We here present a case of an anemic patient, who was given epogen before a coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery and developed periprocedural myocardial infarction. To our knowledge, there has been no previous case reported of epogen causing myocardial infarction. Case Presentation. 66-year-old female presented with substernal chest pain. EKG showed ST segment elevations in aVf and L-III. Patient underwent left heart catheterization (LHC) and had triple vessel disease. A bare metal stent was placed in RCA. Patient continued to have symptoms after discharge and presented to the ED again with these complaints. She underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Before the procedure, patient’s hemoglobin was 11.1 grams/deciliter and was given epogen to raise hemoglobin level. Postoperative day (POD) #1 patient had ST elevations in inferior and anterolateral leads. She was diagnosed with periprocedural myocardial infarction. Patient underwent repeat LHC, which identified obstruction of saphenous vein graft (SVG). Hypercoagulable workup was negative for any disease and the patient was diagnosed with epogen induced early graft occlusion. Conclusion. Epogen administration can cause myocardial infarction and coronary artery thrombosis. We suggest that physicians use epogen very cautiously, especially in population who has underlying coronary artery disease.Epoetin alfa, also known as epogen, is a recombinant human erythropoietin and is used commonly in anemic population with chronic kidney diseases to increase their production of red blood cells. However, it is associated with some serious side effects like thromboembolism and acute coronary syndromes [1–3]. Herein, we discuss a challenging case of an anemic Jehovah’s Witness who required a coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) and was prescribed epoetin alfa prior to CABG surgery. A 66-year-old woman with history of hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism initially presented with pressure-like substernal chest pain radiating to the jaw. Her EKG showed ST segment elevations in augmented vector foot (avf) and limb lead III (L-III) with increased serum cardiac enzymes. She was emergently taken to the catheterization lab and was found to have a 95% stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) (Figure 1), a 60% stenosis in the diagonal 1 branch, and a 75% stenosis in middle left anterior descending artery (mLAD) lesion. The RCA was thought to be the culprit lesion and a bare metal stent (BMS) was placed. However, after the discharge, she continued to have fatigue and lack of energy over the following few weeks. She was also having shortness of breath and chest discomfort when going up 1 flight of stairs or when walking short distances. For these reasons, she came back to the emergency department and was reevaluated. Since she had a known history of triple vessel coronary artery disease on a recent cardiac catheterization, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) was recommended. Prior to the procedure, her hemoglobin was 11.1 grams/deciliter. As she was Jehovah’s Witness and did not accept any blood products, she was given epoetin alfa 20,000 units subcutaneous daily two days before surgery, on the day of surgery, and two days after surgery to raise her hemoglobin level. This step was taken to maximize her preoperative hemoglobin level to balance the expected blood loss during surgery. She underwent a triple vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending artery (LAD), saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the diagonal number 1, and SVG to right posterior descending artery (RPDA). Her left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% immediately pre- and postoperatively.On postoperative day (POD) 1, she was noted have to have new EKG changes, including ST segment elevations in the inferior and anterolateral leads (Figure 2). She was however symptom free and these were thought to be postoperative changes. Her medications were optimized and she was closely observed in the cardiac care unit (CCU). Her cardiac enzymes peaked on POD#3 and then started trending down. However, on POD#7 she became lethargic and hypotensive. Here mental status and blood pressure improved after IV fluid boluses. On POD#8, she complained of shortness of breath and orthopnea. Chest X-ray revealed new bilateral pleural effusion and chest tubes were reinserted.For the reasons stated above, she underwent a repeat echocardiogram (echo), which showed a significant drop in the ejection fraction to 15%. It also identified new akinesis of mid to distal anteroseptal, inferior, and apical walls consistent with the EKG changes. As she had new areas of infarct on the echo, a viability study was performed prior to undergoing further workup. A nuclear viability study showed mild viability of the apex and septum and full viability of the inferior wall.The decision was made to perform a repeat left heart catheterization. Repeat catheterization showed occlusion of SVG graft to RPDA (Figure 3), thrombosis of the LAD distal to the LIMA insertion (Figure 4), and thrombosis of the RPDA (Figure 5). There were no adequate targets for revascularization and it was decided to treat her medically. Her medications were optimized and patient was discharged few weeks later in a well-compensated state to subacute rehabilitation with outpatient follow-up in 2-3 weeks.Patient had fair distal vessels and procedure was uneventful. After multidisciplinary discussion, a full hypercoagulable workup was initiated. The workup included Factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin (factor II) mutation, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, and antiphospholipid antibody, which all came back negative. After the extensive workup and discussion with hematology-oncology, the early SVG graft occlusion was attributed to the administration of epoetin alfa before the CABG surgery.To our knowledge, there has been no other published case report of epoetin alfa causing myocardial infarction reported before.This is a challenging case in terms of diagnosis and management. Our patient was a Jehovah’s Witness and did not accept blood transfusion. She was anemic on presentation and required a high-risk surgery. Therefore, after several multidisciplinary meetings, it was decided that she should receive epoetin alfa to raise her hemoglobin before surgery. The data showing epoetin alfa causing cardiovascular thrombosis is very limited. Below we will discuss the current data regarding epoetin alfa’s side effects.One of the side effects of epoetin alfa is iatrogenic polycythemia causing ischemia secondary to thromboembolism. A meta-analysis review was performed on several trials evaluating the use of erythrocyte-stimulating agents for the treatment of anemia in the oncology setting. 51 trials with 13,611 patients were analyzed and showed a 1.57-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism and increased mortality associated with use of erythrocyte-stimulating agents [1]. This trial, however, did not evaluate if there is an increased risk of coronary artery thrombosis associated with epoetin alfa.Our patient had myocardial infarction secondary to epoetin alfa administration and an association between epoetin alfa and cardiovascular harm was initially described in the Normal Hematocrit Study [2]. This study analyzed 1233 patients with clinical evidence of congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease that were undergoing dialysis. One group received increasing doses of epoetin alfa to reach and maintain a normal hematocrit value of % and the other group continued epoetin alfa therapy to maintain a hematocrit value of %. They found that 33% of the patients in the normal hematocrit group died or had a nonfatal myocardial infarction, as compared to 2% of those in the low hematocrit group (risk ratio 1.3; CI 0.9–1.9).Other trials like the Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR) trial also found increase risk of death, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure in patients with higher hemoglobin (13.5 grams per deciliter) achieved through epoetin alfa as compared to patients with low hemoglobin (11.3 grams per deciliter) (hazard ratio 1.34; CI 1.03–1.74). The trial found that there was a nonsignificant trend towards increased myocardial infarction in patients with high hemoglobin as compared to low hemoglobin (hazard ratio 0.91,  value 0.78) and also a significant increase in hospitalization due to cardiovascular causes in the high hemoglobin group as compared to the low hemoglobin (hazard ratio 1.23; CI 1.01–1.48) [3].Another randomized controlled trial performed on 1,460 critically ill anemic patients with hemoglobin less than 12 grams/deciliter found that when compared with placebo, epoetin alfa was associated with significant increase in the incidence of thrombotic events (hazard ratio. 1.41; 95% CI, 1.06–1.86). In this study, 21 patients suffered myocardial infarction out of which 15 were in the epoetin alfa group ( value: 0.08) [4]. During a review of the marketing application for darbepoetin alfa, an association was found between rate of increase in the hemoglobin level exceeding 1 gram per deciliter per 2-week period and the risk of cardiovascular and thromboembolic event [5]. Our patient had an increase in hemoglobin of 0.9 grams/deciliter within 2 days of the epoetin alfa initiation, which may have contributed in the development of thrombosis within her cardiovascular system.The data on epoetin alfa predisposing to coronary artery thrombosis is limited and there are no concrete guidelines regarding the use of epoetin alfa. However, literature review has shown increase cardiovascular harm with its use. Raising hemoglobin in an anemic patient who does not accept transfusions before a high-risk surgery is beneficial [6]; however, in light of the current evidence, the goal should be to aim for an acceptable level rather than a normal level.Our case report is unique, as a detailed literature search did not show any previous case report tackling this complicated issue. Our patient was anemic and in theory should have benefited with a higher hematocrit before surgery. However, epoetin alfa increases the risk of acute coronary syndrome as shown in this case report and in previous clinical trials. We recommend that epoetin alfa be used cautiously especially in population with heart disease and those receiving epoetin alfa should have ischemic evaluation performed if they develop chest pain or EKG changes.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Case Report of Multiembolic Cerebrovascular Event Associated with Ramp Study Echocardiogram

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The incidence of ramp test echocardiogram-associated embolic events in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation is likely rare and has not been reported. We present such a case in a patient with a HeartMate II left ventricular assist device (LVAD) whose serial head computed tomography images, deteriorating clinical course, and the multiembolic nature of the event suggest causality. If the pretest probability of pump thrombosis in an individual LVAD patient is sufficiently high, the potential risks of performing a ramp study echocardiogram may not be warranted, even in the setting of adequate anticoagulation. The ramp test echocardiogram is a noninvasive test that can diagnose pump thrombosis by comparing expected versus actual left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDD) at different LVAD speeds [1, 2]. It is one of the few research validated imaging methods available for diagnosing LVAD pump thrombosis. While current guidelines warn against performing ramp tests in patients with subtherapeutic anticoagulation given the risk of internal thrombus liberation [3], this test is not traditionally considered a risk factor for thromboembolization in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation. We present, to our knowledge, the first case of multiembolic cerebrovascular event following a ramp test echocardiogram in a patient with appropriate therapeutic anticoagulation.A 64-year-old Caucasian male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and 2 prior coronary bypass-grafting operations underwent implantation with a HeartMate II LVAD as destination therapy. He had an asymptomatic internal pump thrombus diagnosed 35 months after implantation, when outpatient lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels abruptly increased from 400 h/L to 1027 u/L in the setting of a subtherapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 1.8. LDH levels rapidly returned to normal after a short treatment course of intravenous (IV) Heparin. The patient continued aspirin and warfarin, and his INR was therapeutic on subsequent lab tests (target INR 2.2–2.7).Five months later, the patient presented in extremis to an outside hospital in respiratory distress and fluid overload and was intubated and eventually transferred to our institution for a higher level of care. Sputum was positive for Influenza A. Tamiflu and IV antibiotics were started; subsequent blood cultures were negative. Initial INR was 2.9, LDH was 1429 units/L, and haptoglobin was < 10 mg/dL. IV diuretics were started. Initial head computed tomography (CT) scan showed no new or acute processes (Figure 1(a)). Interrogation of the patient’s implantable cardioverter defibrillator revealed no evidence for significant arrhythmias. LVAD interrogation recorded a transient power spike to 9 Watts in the days prior to admission (baseline power = 5.5 Watts).Given the history and findings, a ramp test echo was performed to confirm the diagnosis of LVAD thrombus. Preceding ramp echo testing, standard transthoracic echocardiography was used to verify the absence of intracardiac or aortic root thrombus. From a baseline LVAD speed of 9000 rpm, echocardiogram images were then obtained in stepwise increments from 8600 rpm to 12000 rpm (Figure 2). The aortic valve did not open at any speed. The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) slope was −0.05, and the pulsatility index (PI) slope was −0.18, consistent with an internal pump thrombus [1]. Despite the therapeutic INR, the decision was made to start an IV Heparin drip. Integrilin was not initiated due to a positive test for fecal occult blood and a slowly downtrending hemoglobin level. Pump exchange was not performed due to the hostile mediastinum.The patient was initially stable after the ramp test, but his clinical status rapidly deteriorated over the subsequent 3 days. LDH levels remained highly elevated. Escalating doses of IV milrinone and epinephrine were started for escalating multiorgan failure in the setting of cardiogenic and septic shock. A repeat head CT scan revealed multiple acute embolic infarcts in the bilateral posterior temporal lobes, left occipital lobe, and posterior right middle cerebral artery involving the parietal and temporal lobes (Figure 1(b)). Serial blood cultures remained negative and repeated echocardiogram imaging did not suggest endocarditis. Given the poor prognosis in conjunction with the new CT findings, the family agreed to withdraw medical care and declined autopsy.Of 45 total ramp study echocardiograms performed at our institution, this case is noteworthy for the timing of the ramp study in relation to the multiembolic stroke. It is difficult to directly attribute stroke causality to a ramp test unless the event is immediately, catastrophically apparent. This patient was intubated and sedated, minimizing significant clinical examination findings. The proximity of consecutive head CT images in relation to the ramp study in our case, as well as the multiembolic nature of the event, is suggestive of (briefly delayed) causation. In addition, our patient was actively infected with Influenza A, and infection has been identified as a risk factor for neurologic events in the LVAD population [4–6]. The patient’s anticoagulation was also therapeutic at time of presentation, but as is often the case, his anticoagulation status in the medium term cannot be certain. Although peripherally located thrombus embolization from the carotid bulb has been described [7], the multivascular distribution of the cerebral infarcts suggests a more central source.At present, there are few contraindications to ramp echo, allowing for proactive and often liberal employment of this testing modality. While baseline, preramp imaging is important for device screening, clinical suspicion for thrombus should guide the decision for further testing as speed manipulation creates transient variation in an otherwise continuous flow state, leading to fluctuations in shear strain force [8]. We postulate that this may amplify hemorheological factors such as heat production, platelet activation, and turbulence, which are already recognized as contributory to thrombus formation in LVAD patients [9]. Variation in shear strain force may also lead to thrombus instability and account for potential liberation from the site of the device blood interface. Ultimately, when the pretest probability of pump thrombosis is abundantly high, or if the risk threshold of the ramp study is sufficiently altered by the presence of significant comorbidities, the potential hazards of performing a ramp study echocardiogram may outweigh the diagnostic benefits, even in the setting of chronically therapeutic anticoagulation. A multi-institutional registry quantifying the incidence of embolic strokes occurring in temporal relation to ramp study echocardiograms, with INR correlation, could provide illumination.This manuscript is based on a case presented at the 20th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Heart Failure Society of America.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Aorto-Right Ventricular Shunt after TAVR: Rare Complication of Common Procedure
Department of Cardiology, Texas Heart Institute, Houston, TX, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Ahmad Qurie; moc.liamg@98eiruqdamhaReceived 24 May 2017; Accepted 23 August 2017; Published 28 September 2017Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2017 Abdelkader Almanfi et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Background. The primary treatment of symptomatic aortic stenosis is aortic valve replacement. Instead of open chest surgery, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative intervention for high-risk surgical candidates. Clinical Case. A 92-year-old male presented with progressive exertional dyspnea and recurrent syncopal attacks secondary to severe AS. The patient underwent successful transfemoral TAVR with 29 mm Edwards SAPIEN XT valve. His postoperative course was complicated by aorto-right ventricular shunt. The patient’s clinical course was followed up for one year. Conclusion. This case reports the incidence and clinical course of one of the rare complications of TAVR, aorto-right ventricular fistula. Conservative medical management is appropriate in hemodynamically stable patients with this specific complication.Aortic valve replacement is still the mainstay of treatment of symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). In properly selected patients, this surgical procedure offers substantial improvements in symptoms and life expectancy. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a procedure for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are not candidates for traditional open-chest surgery or are high-risk operable candidates [1]. Our case describes a 92-year-old male who presented with progressive exertional dyspnea and recurrent syncopal attacks secondary to severe AS. The patient underwent successful transfemoral TAVR with 29 mm Edwards SAPIEN XT valve; his postoperative course was complicated by aorto-right ventricular fistula.Our patient is a 92-year-old male with severe aortic stenosis whose past medical history includes umbilical and inguinal hernia, chronic diastolic heart failure, right bundle branch block, coronary artery disease, and obesity. He became significantly symptomatic in the last few months prior to his admission to the hospital, where he complained of worsened dyspnea on exertion and recurrent syncopal attacks. Physical examination did not show any significant findings except for a 5/6 systolic ejection murmur in the aortic area radiating to both carotids. Diagnostic cardiac catheterization showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block. Transesophageal echocardiography showed critical aortic valve stenosis, mean pressure gradient of approximately 72 mmHg, valve area of 0.46 cm2, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. A 29 mm Edwards SAPIEN XT valve was implanted via transfemoral access. Confirmation of position was then done by aortography. The transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the adequate position of the valve with minimal aortic insufficiency. There was no pericardial effusion with normal ventricular systolic function. Postdeployment aortogram showed paravalvular leak and patent coronary arteries.Postdeployment hemodynamics showed zero mmHg mean gradient pressure between the left ventricle and the aorta with left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP)  10 mmHg.Post-TAVR day 1 routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed well-seated and normally functioning bioprosthetic aortic valve with a small posterior paravalvular leak. It also showed a small-sized continuous (systolic and diastolic phases) shunt, which communicated with the aortic root into the right ventricle (aorto-RV shunt) (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)).Since the patient was asymptomatic following the procedure, he was managed conservatively with close follow-up. His repeat TTE a month after the procedure revealed no significant change from his post-TAVR day 1 TTE (Figure 2). Therefore, we decided to continue with medical management and close follow-up, since the patient was asymptomatic.Follow-up with TTE a year later showed persistence of the aorto-RV fistula and significant improvement in the velocity across the shunt (Figure 3), which may be due to a decrease in the fistula size rather than an increase in RV pressure as RV systolic pressure (RVSP) remained within normal limits on follow-up TTE.A few cases of an aorto-right ventricular shunt after TAVR procedure have been reported. Complications associated with TAVR may be specific to TAVR, such as valve malposition, paravalvular aortic regurgitation, conduction abnormalities, and coronary obstruction, or not specific to TAVR, such as vascular access complications and cardiac perforation or tamponade seen with other endovascular interventions [2, 3]. In our patient, we believe that aortic root rupture may have resulted from displacement of the calcified tissue, causing local trauma. The clinical presentation of an aorto-right ventricular shunt depends on the size and hemodynamic significance of the shunt [4]. Despite the presence of the shunt, our patient was clinically asymptomatic even after one year following the procedure. However, the mean interval between the time of injury and definitive vascular repair was 1.5 years due to development of severe heart failure symptoms as reported by Samuels et al. [5]. As spontaneous closure of aorto-RV fistula has not been reported, it is very important to follow up with all patients regularly. With all the advances in interventional cardiology, successful percutaneous closure of aorto-RV fistula has been reported using a septal occluder [6].The details of this report were presented at the C3 meeting in Orlando, Florida, in June 2017.None of the authors has any potential conflicts of interest with regard to the work described in this manuscript.
A Rare Association of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy with High-Degree Atrioventricular Block
1Department of Internal Medicine, New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital Center, New York, NY, USA2Cardiology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital Center, New York, NY, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Eder Hans Cativo; moc.oohay@navsnahdeReceived 6 July 2017; Accepted 15 August 2017; Published 20 September 2017Academic Editor: Filippo M. SarulloCopyright © 2017 Eder Hans Cativo et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Here we present a case of a patient who got trapped in an elevator; on initial evaluation patient was found with bradycardia; on further evaluation electrocardiogram (EKG) showed new onset 2nd-degree Mobitz type 2 AV block. On admission patient developed ischemic changes on EKG and troponin elevation. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction as well as apical inferior, anterior, lateral, and septal hypokinesia. Coronary angiography showed nonobstructive coronary artery disease and ventriculogram demonstrated anterolateral and apical hypokinesia suggesting takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). Atrioventricular block (AV) is rarely seen as initial presentation of TCM and has a prevalence of about 2.9%. AV block during early presentation of TCM poses a therapeutic dilemma with regard to the timing and the need to place a temporary or permanent pacemaker. The decision to place a permanent pacemaker may be on a case-by-case basis and more research is needed on formulating standardized recommendations in patients with TCM and conduction tissue abnormalities.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a distinct form of cardiomyopathy characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV) and usually occurs secondary to severe emotional or physical stress [1, 2]. The presence of arrhythmias especially atrioventricular block used to be regarded an uncommon accompaniment of TCM but in recent year few reports of some association have emerged [3, 4]. Although TCM usually reverses completely within a few weeks, associated arrhythmias may be associated with poor prognosis [3–5].The association of atrioventricular block with TCM may pose some therapeutic dilemma with respect to the need of a pacemaker and also the requirement for follow-up with a loop recorder [5].We therefore present this case report with a view to elucidate the rare occurrence of atrioventricular block with TCM and possible interventions that may improve outcome in this patient population.This is a 53-year-old African female patient who was brought in by emergency medical services (EMS) after the patient got trapped in the elevator. At that moment, she started feeling anxious and scared following which she activated EMS. EMS arrived at the scene after 20 minutes. During their evaluation, the patient stated she had retrosternal chest pain which was dull in quality, nonradiating, and 7/10 in severity. The chest pain had resolved at the time EMS arrived. At the time the patient arrived at our hospital, she was asymptomatic. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 146/77 mmHg, heart rate of 42 bpm, and respiratory rate of 16 per minute. Initial EKG as shown in Figure 1 demonstrated a 2nd-degree Mobitz type 2 atrial-ventricular (AV) block 2 : 1 with a heart rate of 40 bpm. Laboratory data were remarkable for troponin I 0.03 ng/ml (normal range is <0.02 ng/ml), pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide 271 pg/ml, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, and hemoglobin 12.9 g/dl. The patient had normal hepatic function test and thyroid stimulating hormone (3.49 mU/mL). Chest X-ray showed normal cardiac silhouette and no sign of fluid overload.Patient was admitted to coronary care unit (CCU) and a transcutaneous pacemaker was placed on demand. Labs were repeated 6 hours later after admission and troponin I trended up to 0.93 ng/ml, suggesting cardiac injury. Repeat EKG demonstrated T wave inversion in the anterolateral leads (Figure 2). Patient was started on heparin drip and loading doses of Plavix and aspirin were given. Our patient did not have -blockers because of her presentation with bradycardia. Transthoracic 2D-echocardiogram revealed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% as well as apical inferior, anterior, lateral, and septal hypokinesia.Coronary angiogram was done in the view of new AV block, T wave inversion on EKG, and elevated troponin. Coronary angiogram demonstrated nonobstructive coronary artery disease. Ventriculogram demonstrated anterolateral and apical hypokinesia consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Figure 3). On further workup electrophysiology study revealed high-degree suprahisian AV block with intermittent 1 : 1 AV conduction, as well as 2 : 1. Recommendations were event monitor and follow-up.Cardiac MRI was carried out just before discharge and showed normal LV ejection fraction (EF) of 66 and right ventricle EF of 66%. There was no evidence of myocardial scar, necrosis, or edema. LV apex appeared to be hypertrabeculated. Cardiac MRI findings were similar to those of the repeated transthoracic echocardiogram upon discharge which also showed LVEF of 60% with no wall motion abnormalities.TCM was first described in Japan by Sato in 1991 [1]. TCM is also referred to as apical ballooning syndrome, broken heart syndrome, or stress cardiomyopathy [6]. It is most commonly seen in postmenopausal women and frequently precipitated by a stressful event as seen in our patient [4]. TCM is characterized by transient LV dysfunction with typical distinct wall motion abnormalities of the apical and/or midventricular or basal segments [7]. The pathogenesis is not well understood but catecholamine excess has been postulated as being central to the pathogenesis of TCM [1]. Some researchers have found that circulating levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine may be 2 to 3 times higher in TCM than in patients with acute myocardial infarction [1].Although the clinical presentation simulates that of an acute myocardial infarction, coronary arteriography typically shows no obstructive lesions [1]. The most common clinical symptoms among patients with TCM are chest pain and dyspnea but other rare presentations may occur [4, 8].Arrhythmias have been described as an unusual complication of TCM and may include ventricular arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, torsade de pointes, and conduction tissue dysfunction [8, 9]. Atrioventricular block (AV) is also a rarer association with TCM and has a prevalence of about 2.9% [9]. Few reports suggest that AV block may be commoner in elder women who may have aging as a contributor to AV dysfunction unlike what was seen in our 56-year-old patient. The association of complete AV block and TCM remains a conundrum because the damaged apical ventricle is some distance away from the conduction pathways in the atrium, bundle of His, atrioventricular node, and intrahisian region [3]. As a result, some authors suggest that diffuse spasms in small branches of the coronary arteries may be responsible for both myocardial ischemia and atrioventricular conduction disturbances [4].It is interesting to note that many cases of high-degree AV block coexisting with TCM had persisted even after recovery of myocardial function necessitating permanent cardiac pacemaker implantation [4]. It is possible that the recovery of the cardiac conduction system is prolonged and lags that of the myocardial tissue recovery in patients with TCM [4, 8]. Nault et al. demonstrated, in an electrophysiological study, lack of resolution of a high-degree AV block 1 year after TCM which eventually resolved 2 years later [4].Therefore, AV block during early presentation of TCM poses a therapeutic dilemma with regard to the timing and the need to place a temporary or permanent pacemaker. The decision to place a permanent pacemaker may be on a case-by-case basis because of the ongoing debate in view of the reversible nature of TCM and attendant complications of permanent pacemaker devices such as infection and inappropriate shocks [7]. The placement of a temporary pacemaker in our patient appears to have sufficed and she did not require permanent pacemaker in the long run. Following electrophysiology, our patient was noted to have high-degree suprahisian block. Other authors may place a permanent pacemaker if AV block persists and or if infrahisian block is seen during electrophysiology studies [3]. Shanmugasundaram et al. [4] also reported placing a permanent pacemaker after 18 days of persistent AV block while the patient was on a temporary pacemaker during recovery from TCM.Caution should also be taken with regard to use of β-blockers which has been described by some authors as the mainstay of therapy among patients with TCM because of the strong link with catecholamine excess [7].Dangerous arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and complete AV block are possibilities in patients with TCM when features of conduction tissue disease are present. Placing and event loop recorder as in our case might have been a wise option as missing sinister arrhythmias may be lethal during the recovery period in some patients with TCM [5].Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rare disease and its coexistence with high-degree atrioventricular block is rarer. The prognosis of TCM is good, but extra care should be taken when there is coexistent conductive tissue disease as the need for permanent pacemakers may arise and fatality rate may also be high due to occurrence of malignant arrhythmias. More research is needed on formulating standardized recommendations in patients with TCM and conduction tissue abnormalities.Patient’s consent was obtained.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
H. capsulatum: A Not-So-Benign Cause of Pericarditis
1Department of Internal Medicine, Southern Illinois University, 751 N Rutledge, Springfield, IL 62702, USA2Infectious Disease, Southern Illinois University, 751 N Rutledge, Springfield, IL 62702, USA3Division of Cardiology, Southern Illinois University, 751 N Rutledge, Springfield, IL 62702, USA4Clinical Internal Medicine, Southern Illinois University, 751 N Rutledge, Springfield, IL 62702, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Paolo K.

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The common causes of pericarditis and its course are benign in the majority of cases. Thus, further testing is usually not pursued and treatment for a presumptive viral etiology with nonsteroidal agents and steroids has been an accepted strategy. We present a patient with pericarditis who was unresponsive to first-line therapy and was subsequently found to have necrotizing granulomas of the pericardium with extensive adhesions and fungal elements seen on tissue biopsy. Serologic testing confirms active H. capsulatum infection, and he responded well to Itraconazole treatment. In patients with pericarditis who fail standard therapy with NSAIDs and steroids, it is suggested that they undergo thorough evaluation and that histoplasmosis be considered as an etiology, especially in endemic regions.We report an uncommon case of an adult male from the Midwestern United States presenting with as acute pericarditis due to Histoplasma capsulatum infection. We reviewed the literature on H. capsulatum pericarditis and discussed the diagnosis and management of necrotizing granulomatous pericarditis due to H. capsulatum. We recommend that histoplasmosis infection be on the differential diagnoses in patients having acute pericarditis in endemic regions.A 56-year-old male with obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dyslipidemia presented with nonexertional chest pain that wakes him up at night exacerbated by coughing and laying supine. There were no associated fever, dizziness syncope, and palpitation. He recalls symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection which have resolved a few weeks earlier. Our patient is an office worker with no additional risk factors as smoking, chest trauma, recent travel, significant outdoor exposure, and family history of malignancy.On evaluation, blood pressure was 144/68 mmhg, HR was 101 bpm, RR was 24 cpm, and the patient was afebrile. Eye and oral examination showed no suspicious lesions. There was no skin rash and synovitis. Cardiovascular examination was negative for jugular venous distention and hepatojugular reflex. Precordium was mildly tender, point of maximal impulse was adynamic and nondisplaced, and there was no palpable ventricular heave. On auscultation, S1 and S2 sounds were muffled; a precordial rub was appreciated over the left sternal border and is heard throughout the cardiac cycle. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.Electrocardiography showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes and no PR abnormalities. Troponin values were normal. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a mildly thickened pericardium with no pericardial effusion. Global ventricular wall motion was normal. Results of the initial laboratory investigation are outlined in Table 1. This shows leukocytosis with lymphopenia and monocytosis, elevated ESR, and normal renal function. The patient was then started on a course of Ibuprofen and Prednisone for suspected viral pericarditis.During his 4-week follow-up, the patient reported some improvement of the chest discomfort but now endorses decreased exercise tolerance, exertional dyspnea, and worsening fatigue. D-Dimer was obtained and was slightly elevated, 0.47 (reference: 0.27–0.40 mcg/ml). Computed tomography of the chest demonstrated no pulmonary artery embolism. The pericardium was markedly thickened, along with a small amount of nonloculated pericardial effusion. Visualized were multiple enlarged mediastinal and subcarinal lymph nodes and a 1.2 cm pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe (Figure 1). Taking his risk factors into account, his symptoms were now concerning for coronary ischemia. Myocardial Perfusion Scanning revealed a moderately intense area of reversible defect consistent with ischemia and infarction of the inferior wall. There were no features of hemodynamic collapse. Subsequent Coronary Angiography confirmed severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (mid-LAD 80%, 1st Diagonal 90% ostial lesion, 2nd Diagonal 80%, and RCA 100% with collaterals). Left ventriculogram showed hypokinesis of the basal inferior myocardium with an estimated EF of 50%.The patient underwent urgent Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). Intraoperatively, upon violating the pericardial sac, it was immediately evident that he had extensive nodular adhesions on the visceral and parietal pericardium. Gram stain and cultures for bacteria and acid fast bacilli were negative. Histopathology demonstrated a necrotizing granulomatous inflammation that stained positive for fungal elements within the central necrotic tissue. No malignant cells were identified (Figure 2). Screening for sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and HIV infection was negative. Further serologic testing confirms H. capsulatum infection (Table 1). His postoperative course remained unremarkable. Treatment with Itraconazole was initiated with instructions to complete a 6-month course and a follow-up chest CT scan to monitor progression of the visualized solitary pulmonary nodule.Our index case fulfilled the clinical diagnostic criteria for acute pericarditis with typical chest pain, pericardial friction rub, and new pericardial effusion [1]. There were no diffuse ST-T wave changes on electrocardiogram and there was no pericardial effusion on echocardiography. The diagnosis is clinical and, in eighty percent of cases, the etiology is viral [2–4]. Therapy is empirically directed towards inflammation [3, 5].Management of his condition included prednisone and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Due to the benign course of the illness associated with the common causes of pericarditis, it is not necessary to search for the etiology in all patients [2–4], especially in areas with low rates of tuberculosis [6]. Hence, treatment for a presumptive viral etiology is an acceptable strategy. Even with extensive evaluation, a definite cause is established in only 16% of cases [7, 8]. Similarly, in a three case series that included a total of 784 unselected patients who underwent extensive testing, a specific diagnosis was only obtained in 130 cases (17%) [7, 9, 10].H. capsulatum is a thermally dimorphic fungus endemic to North and Central America and is a common cause of fungal pericarditis in patients with an intact immune system [11–13]. Histoplasma pericarditis was first described in 1955 by Billings and Couch in a patient with pericardial calcification and positive histoplasmin skin test [14]. Three years later, Heiner (1958) reported a case of constrictive pericarditis in a pediatric patient. The etiologic agent was diagnosed as H. capsulatum by skin and serologic testing [15]. Perhaps the largest case series, with sixteen patients, by Picardi et al. (1976) concluded that this form of granulomatous pericarditis carries a good prognosis [16]. To date, we found approximately 35 reported cases of pericarditis caused by H. capsulatum.The pathogenesis of pericarditis due to histoplasmosis is thought to be due to hypersensitivity to antigens from the yeast-phase cells of H. capsulatum within the mediastinal lymph nodes or adjacent pulmonary focus of the host [16, 17]. Pericardial involvement occurs as a complication of inflammation and represents an inflammatory condition rather than infection of the pericardium [18]. This explains why organisms are not recovered from pericardial fluid and cannot typically be isolated and cultured from biopsy specimens [19, 20].In biopsy specimens, granulomas are common [13, 21]. Granulomas are a form of highly effective, nonspecific antifungal immune response mediated by macrophages infected with Histoplasma. This mechanism is essential to contain fungal growth, prevent systemic dissemination, and protect the organs from widespread inflammatory tissue damage [22]. The cytokines involved in this process are mainly TNF- and IFN- [22]. This places histoplasmosis in the differential diagnosis of sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and malignancy. It is especially important that the distinction between sarcoidosis and histoplasmosis be made. Failure to exclude the diagnosis of histoplasmosis before treatment for a cardiac sarcoid may lead to marked disease exacerbation if immunosuppressive therapy is initiated in a patient who actually has acute histoplasmosis [23]. Ineffective cell-mediated immunity leads to the inability to control reticuloendothelial spread of histoplasmosis and disseminated disease [13, 24, 25]. In this case, the angiotensin-converting enzyme level and the QuantiFERON-TB test were notably negative. Suspicion for fungal etiology was triggered when fungal elements were visualized on GMS staining. The diagnosis of histoplasmosis was eventually made with serologic testing (Table 2).A variety of tests may be utilized for detecting histoplasmosis including histopathology stains for fungi, fluid, and tissue cultures and Ag-Ab detection. Complement fixation and immunodiffusion (IF) are both serologic tests utilized in H. capsulatum detection with similar sensitivities above 90% [26]. The immunodiffusion test is less sensitive compared to immunodiffusion but has specificity of almost 100% [27, 28] In immunodiffusion, test results are reported as M or H precipitins or bands. Most patients will develop an M band, while the H precipitin band is detectable in fewer than 20% of cases and is seen most often in patients with disseminated disease [29]. Antigen testing in our patient revealed comp-fix titers of 1 : 8 and a positive M band with IF. Although higher comp-fix titers are highly suggestive of an acute infection, lower titers as seen in this case are seen in one-third of active disease.Management of Histoplasma pericarditis is based on the guideline released in 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. NSAIDs are the mainstay of therapy for mild disease [18]. In the event of hemodynamic compromise and in individuals who fail to improve on NSAIDs, prednisone may be used. Pericardiocentesis is also indicated in those with evidence of hemodynamic compromise. Although there is no active pericardial fungal infection, the use of Itraconazole is advocated in moderate-to-severe disease [18]. However, due to lack of clinical trials, it is unclear whether antifungal therapy alters the course of histoplasmosis pericarditis [30].Once treatment is initiated, a quantitative antigen enzyme immunoassay may be used to monitor decreases in serum and urine H. capsulatum antigens [31]. This strategy was not employed for our patient, since he had very low antigen titers before treatment. In this situation, there is no test to document disease eradication. Improvement is assessed based solely on clinical findings.Since the submission of this article, our patient presented for biopsy of the left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. Results reveal a benign tissue with necrotizing granuloma, negative for fungal and mycobacterial elements. No repeat antigen testing was performed and he remains asymptomatic to this day.We present a rare case of histoplasmosis pericarditis that failed therapy with NSAIDs and steroids but responded to Itraconazole treatment. We recommend that, in endemic regions, clinicians should further evaluate patients with typical symptoms of pericarditis and consider histoplasmosis as an etiology, especially in patients that fail first-line therapy.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.Special thanks are due to Dr. Jeff F.

The technological advances in the field of percutaneous techniques have facilitated the use of nonsurgical endovascular alternatives for peripheral arterial disease in patients with significant comorbidities at high surgical risk, as illustrated in our case report. We report a case of chronic total occlusion of the aorta that was treated percutaneously with endovascular stenting. We also discuss the specific technique used in this procedure.Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) is a subset of peripheral vascular disease in which lesions can occur anywhere from the distal aorta to the common femoral arteries. The aorta and the iliac arteries may be involved either independently or in combination. Total occlusion of the infrarenal aorta is rare, with an estimated prevalence of 0.15% according to one autopsy study [1]. In patients presenting with AIOD, total occlusion of the infrarenal aorta has been seen in 3 to 8.5% of the cases [2–4]. AIOD commonly occurs in association with coronary artery disease (CAD). Surgical management of advanced AIOD is time-tested and a widely accepted strategy, particularly when there is significant CAD associated with AIOD. The novel developments in percutaneous techniques in recent years have facilitated the use of nonsurgical endovascular alternatives in many patients with CAD and AIOD. We report a case of acute coronary syndrome with critical limb ischemia (CLI) of the lower limbs due to chronic total occlusion (CTO) of infrarenal aorta and extensive bilateral iliac disease managed by endovascular therapy.A 54-year-old African American male with a 20-pack-year smoking history, habituated to polysubstance abuse, presented to the emergency department with severe pain, numbness, and progressive weakness in his left lower extremity. He also complained of multiple episodes of exertional substernal chest discomfort. He was being treated for chronic back pain secondary to vertebral disk herniation with radiculopathy. At admission, his vitals were stable with blood pressure 151/68 mmHg, tachycardia 115–120 beats/minute, respiratory rate 16 per minute, and saturation 99% in room air. His right foot was cold and distal pulses were not palpable in both feet. Bedside Doppler arterial signals were present. There was mild sensory loss in the left foot with a chronic nonhealing ulcer at the tip of the great toe. Electrocardiogram revealed ST segment elevation and T-wave inversion in leads II, III, and aVF. Laboratory examination was unremarkable except for elevated troponin-I levels. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20% with hypokinesis of the anterior, anteroseptal, and apical walls. No thrombus was visualized. Conventional angiography and contrast enhanced computed tomography scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed complete occlusion of the infrarenal aorta and reconstitution of both iliac arteries via the right and left internal mammary (thoracic) arteries collateralizing bilateral inferior epigastric arteries.Coronary angiography demonstrated a left dominant coronary system and obstructive lesions were seen in the second obtuse marginal, ramus intermedius, and the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) arteries, as well as the nondominant right coronary (Figures 1(a) and 2(b)). Complete occlusion of the infrarenal aorta with patent bilateral renal arteries and superior mesenteric artery was noted (Figure 1(c)). Successful stenting of LAD, obtuse marginal, and ramus intermedius arteries was performed (Figure 1(d)). 72 hours later, the patient complained of acute chest pain; a repeat coronary angiogram showed acute stent thrombosis in ramus intermedius requiring repeat angioplasty and stent placement (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)).The hospital course was further complicated by recurrent fevers and the patient was found to have worsening rhabdomyolysis within the lower extremities with rising creatinine kinase levels. Patient continued to have fevers despite antibiotics and developed worsening left lower extremity swelling and disappearance of Doppler signals of the left foot. Due to high surgical risk, angiography and a complex percutaneous recanalization procedure were performed. A right common femoral access was attempted but was unsuccessful due to total occlusion in the distal right external iliac artery. After obtaining right brachial access, a 90 cm carotid sheath was placed over a Magic Torque wire and angiogram of the aorta was performed which redemonstrated the CTO of the aorta. As conventional techniques with generic wires and catheters such as 035 glide and Quick-Cross were unsuccessful in crossing the aortic lesion, as a last resort, a Wildcat catheter was selected. After placing a bend on the catheter, the catheter was directed away from the renal arteries and in the direction of the aorta to reduce the risk of perforation. After carefully drilling through the occlusion with the juicebox, the CTO of the distal aorta and left iliac arteries were crossed successfully with a Magic Torque wire. Using a loop wire technique, a Quick-Cross was placed distally and looped down the aorta enabling access to superficial femoral artery with use of a guidewire. Angiography was performed through the Quick-Cross to ensure that it was located in the true lumen of superficial femoral artery. The aortic lumen through the occlusion was then stabilized using self-expanding stents (Figures 3 and 4). The left common iliac, external iliac, and superficial femoral arteries were serially dilated with appropriate sized balloons with good establishment of blood flow to the left lower extremity (Figures 5 and 6).After the procedure, he remained febrile despite negative cultures and was maintained on empiric broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. However, the infection in the left foot worsened and progressed into wet gangrene, necessitating a left sided above knee amputation. The patient was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation facility after a prolonged in-hospital stay.Transatlantic Intersociety Consensus (TASC) guidelines, initially published in 2000 and revised in 2007, classify aortic and iliac lesions by lesion morphology (Table 1). TASC II recommends endovascular treatment for TASC A and B lesions and surgical therapy for TASC C and D lesions [5, 6]. Significant CAD that is associated with limb-threatening AIOD have been conventionally treated with coronary bypass surgery followed by appropriate peripheral vascular surgery [7, 8]. The surgery, often comprising anatomic or extra-anatomic bypass grafting or endarterectomy, has been the standard of care often with excellent results. Patency of aortic bifurcation grafts was 90% and 75% at 5 and 10 years in a meta-analysis done in 1997 [9]. Improvements in endovascular therapies for AIOD introduced in recent years offer the advantages of less morbidity, faster recovery, and shorter hospital stay making them competitive alternative to surgery [10–12].Collateral blood supply via bilateral inferior epigastric arteries and internal thoracic arteries to the lower extremities in our patient meant that using the internal mammary (thoracic) arteries for coronary revascularization would compromise the blood supply to the lower extremity. Hence, the patient underwent percutaneous angioplasty of the stenosed coronary arteries. Critical limb ischemia (CLI) and severe left ventricular dysfunction added to the complexity of the case. CLI independently carries a poor prognosis with high rate of need for amputation (30%) and significant mortality (25%) in 1 year [5]. Acute worsening of lower extremity ischemia in our patient was from the low cardiac output state resulting in downstream ischemia in setting of severe chronic aortic and peripheral vascular disease. An endovascular approach was preferred for recanalizing the aorta in the acute setting, despite the technical difficulties of such a lesion, considering the high risk for surgical mortality. The worsening gangrene of the foot necessitated the emergent endovascular intervention of aortic total occlusion. This procedure is known to be challenging even in the nonemergent setting as the angioplasty is associated with a risk of dissection, perforation, acute thrombosis, atheroembolism, and other contrast related complications (anaphylaxis or contrast-induced renal dysfunction) [13].Niizeki et al. reported a similar case of patient with CAD with Leriche syndrome, who was relatively stable allowing addressing the aortic occlusion as a first step followed by complex PCI of the RCA lesion. Unlike our patient, the aortic lesion in that patient could be crossed with conventional approach using bifemoral and left brachial approach and two self-expanding stents were deployed at the aortoiliac bifurcation [14]. A study by Kim et al. tackled 49 patients with a CTO of the aorta treated via endovascular approach [15]. They reported procedural success in 40 cases with 7 patients requiring reintervention and an overall 80% patency rate at 3 years. None of the patients required major amputation but major complications were reported in 16% of the cases like spinal and cerebral infarctions, distal embolization, side branch jailing, iliac artery rupture, and pseudoaneurysm formation among others.Our case also demonstrates the usefulness of a Wildcat catheter to cross the chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the aorta after attempting conventional techniques. The Wildcat catheter was originally designed and tested to cross difficult total occlusion in iliac arteries. It was proven to be safe and effective in crossing total femoroiliac occlusions in the CONNECT Study and was subsequently FDA approved [16]. The device is designed to traverse the CTO through the applications of 2 wedges at the distal tip (Figure 7, adapted from official Avinger website http://avinger.com/products/wildcat). The Frontrunner (Cordis) and Crosser CTO (vibrational angioplasty) are alternative choices though neither of them has been specifically studied for crossing a CTO of the aorta.When applied to the appropriate anatomical problem, the results of iliac angioplasty/stent placement rival open surgical results but its application in proximal occlusive disease is controversial with lack of long-term follow-up data. Another limitation that may discourage such strategy is the complicated learning curve inherent to the technique. Moreover, no randomized trials have been done, and only single center studies are available in literature.Our case illustrates a complex situation of a symptomatic severe CAD with significant LV dysfunction, AIOD, and collaterals from lateral thoracic wall arteries and epigastric arteries to lower limb arteries complicated by distal critical lower limb arterial occlusion that was managed by percutaneous intervention of the coronary lesions and endovascular opening of CTO of aortic occlusion using Wildcat catheter and revascularization of lower limb arterial occlusions.An earlier version of this work was presented as an abstract at 4th International Conference on Clinical & Experimental Cardiology, 14–16 April 2014.All authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.Mahek Shah and Soumya Patnaik have contributed equally.
Persistent Unexplained Dyspnea: A Case of Hepatopulmonary Syndrome
Department of Cardiology, Hospital “S. M. della Misericordia”, Perugia, ItalyCorrespondence should be addressed to Alfonso Campanile; ti.liamtoh@elinapmacosnoflaReceived 21 June 2017; Accepted 1 August 2017; Published 29 August 2017Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2017 Alfonso Campanile et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Regarding a patient with dyspnea, the history and physical examination often lead to the correct diagnosis. In some circumstances, when more than one underlying disease is present, the diagnostic process can be more challenging. We describe an unusual case of dyspnea and persistent hypoxemia related to a hepatopulmonary syndrome in a 53-year-old patient with known heart failure and chronic liver disease. Initially managed with intravenous diuretic therapy, due to signs of lung and peripheral congestion, our patient did not improve as expected; therefore we performed more advanced studies with a chest-abdomen CT scan and a right heart catheterization. They showed, respectively, no signs of parenchymal and vasculature lung disease, a cirrhotic liver disease, splenomegaly, signs of portal hypertension, and high cardiac output with normal pulmonary vascular resistance. These results, along with the association of hypoxemia and chronic liver disease, suggested a hepatopulmonary syndrome. The diagnosis was confirmed by the demonstration of an intrapulmonary vascular dilatation with right to left shunt during a microbubble transthoracic echocardiography and a lung perfusion scan. Liver transplantation is the only successful treatment for this syndrome; however, the patient became soon unsuitable for this strategy, due to a rapid clinical deterioration.Dyspnea is a common symptom that affects up to 50% of patients admitted to acute, tertiary care hospitals and a quarter of patients seeking care in ambulatory settings [1]. In specialty practice, patients with chronic dyspnea account for 15–50% of those seen by cardiologists and just under 60% of those seen by pneumonologists [2]. The distribution of underlying diagnoses varies from one care situation to another; however, lung and heart pathologies represent the most frequent causes [3]. In 30–50% of cases, particularly in elderly and multimorbid patients, the diagnosis can be challenging and more information is needed [3].We present herein a case of dyspnea in a 53-year-old man with several morbidities, where the symptom was initially interpreted as a manifestation of heart failure but, after extensive investigations, related to a more rare condition: the hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS).A 53-year-old man was admitted to our cardiology department due to a history of progressive dyspnea (NYHA class III). His medical background was characterized by a congenital heart disease (interventricular septal defect, surgically corrected when he was 10 with a dacron patch apposition), aortic valve and interventricular patch replacement (mechanical St. Jude 25 and a new dacron patch), respectively, for severe aortic regurgitation and interventricular defect recurrence (Laubry-Pezzi syndrome), permanent atrial fibrillation in oral anticoagulant therapy, chronic liver disease (HCV-related), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), pancytopenia, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension, and a previous admission with a diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The main clinical and laboratory parameters are summarized in Table 1. The physical examination revealed jugular venous distension, an irregular cardiac rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur over the aortic and mitral valve, a significant reduction of breath sounds on the right basal zone, and a peripheral edema. An atrial fibrillation with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) was detected on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and a chest X-ray revealed signs of pulmonary congestion and a right basal pleural effusion (Figure 1). The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a dilated left ventricle with preserved EF (60%), a dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function, no residual shunt at the interventricular septum, aortic mechanical prosthesis in a correct position, with preserved discs opening, no signs of pathological intra- or periprosthesis regurgitation, increased transprosthetic gradients (mean gradient of 33 mmHg), and an effective orifice area index (EOAi) of 0,4 cm2/m2 suggesting severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) (Figure 2) [4, 5]. Moderate mitral and severe tricuspid regurgitation were documented as well, with an estimated systolic pulmonary pressure (sPAP) of 50 mmHg. No pericardial effusion was detected and a dilated inferior vena cava with poor collapsibility during inspiration was evident. Both clinical and instrumental data suggested a diagnosis of HFpEF and an intravenous diuretic treatment was started. Despite good response to the therapy, documented both clinically (reduction of peripheral edema) and radiographically (a second chest X-ray did not document signs of pulmonary congestion), the patient remained symptomatic for dyspnea with low exercise tolerance. The oxygen therapy was still needed to maintain a satisfactory blood oxygenation. We decided, therefore, first to study the pulmonary parenchyma and vasculature system with a contrast CT scan and second to perform, guided by the CT results, a right heart catheterization. A chest-abdomen CT examination was carried on with evidence of small right pleural effusion, no signs of lung parenchymal disease and pulmonary embolism (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)), cirrhotic liver disease with a focal lesion highly suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma, splenomegaly, and signs of portal hypertension (Figure 3(c)). The hemodynamic study was then scheduled and revealed high cardiac output and normal pulmonary vascular resistance with only a slight increase of the mean pulmonary pressure and wedge pressure. The intravenous diuretic therapy was carried on; however the high cardiac output state and the results of the abdominal CT scan pushed us towards other hypothesis. A gastroenterology consultant review was requested and the hypothesis of a hepatopulmonary syndrome was advanced. A microbubble TTE (MTTE) and a lung scintigraphy (99 mTc-MAA) were performed with evidence of intrapulmonary right to left shunt (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). The diagnosis of HPS was confirmed and the patient was transferred to the gastroenterology department for the specific treatment required. In less than three months, his medical condition rapidly deteriorated despite treatment. He developed multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure, and severe encephalopathy. Due to rapid evolution of the clinical picture, he was unsuitable for transplantation and moved under the management of the palliative care team.The HPS is a severe and common pulmonary vascular complication of liver disease with a prevalence varying from 4 to 47% [6]. The diagnosis, based on the classic triad of hepatic disease, arterial deoxygenation, and intrapulmonary vascular dilatation (IPVD) [7], can often be missed due to nonspecific presentation and presence of other comorbidities [8]. Our case well illustrates this challenging situation. The most evident symptom of HPS is dyspnea; however, other clinical manifestations, more commonly seen in this syndrome, despite not specific for it, are platypnea (increased shortness of breath while sitting up from prone position), orthodeoxia (decrease in arterial saturation by more than 5% or 4 mmHg in erect position), spider nevi, and clubbing [9]. Apart from progressive dyspnea, none of these features were present in our patient during the admission, which contributed to the delay in our diagnosis. Another peculiar characteristic of our case is that the severity of liver disease was accidentally brought to light by investigations performed with a different aim: the definition of the dyspnea causes. A similar pattern was described in a previous case report, where the HPS guided the diagnosis of cirrhosis [10]; however, in that case, the patient did not have any documented history of liver disease while our patient presented to our attention with a history of liver disease related to HCV infection. In relation to this aspect it is important to point out that there is no direct correlation between severity of HPS and the underlying liver disease [11]. Since his admission the patient showed two of the three main characteristics of the HPS: liver disease and low pulse oximetry saturation. To make a definite diagnosis we needed to demonstrate an IPVD with a right to left shunt. We decided, therefore, to perform both a MTTE and a 99 mTc-MAA. The first is, indeed, considered the gold standard for diagnosing intrapulmonary shunting [12, 13]. The second one does not distinguish intracardiac and intrapulmonary shunting and has inferior sensitivity compared to MTTE; however, it may help to distinguish the degree of hypoxemia caused by IPVD (abnormal brain uptake > 6%) in the setting of coexistent intrinsic cardiopulmonary disease [13]. Specifically, our patient showed a brain uptake equal to 19%, suggesting a predominant contribution of the right to left shunt in the severity of his hypoxemia. Currently, no effective medical therapies exist for the hepatopulmonary syndrome, and liver transplantation is the only successful treatment, with improvement or complete resolution in hypoxia in 85% of cases within 1 year [10]. Supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation > 88% is frequently recommended, but there are no data to confirm clinical benefits [14]. The mortality is significantly worse (doubled) in cirrhotic patients with HPS in comparison to patients without HPS; that is why patients with HPS may be eligible to receive a higher priority on the transplant waitlist, depending on the allocation system [13, 15]. HPS is usually asymptomatic, so all liver transplant centers should routinely screen patients for HPS [6]. In our case the combination of different factors (severe cardiac disease and unrecognized advanced liver disease) contributed to a delayed diagnosis with subsequent limited therapeutic options which resulted in the poor outcome outlined.The hepatopulmonary syndrome is a severe complication of liver disease and it significantly affects the patient’s prognosis. Its diagnosis is complicated because it is often asymptomatic and when it becomes evident, its clinical manifestations (e.g., dyspnea) are not specific and can easily be related to other more frequent pathological conditions. We should always consider this condition in the differential diagnosis of unexplained hypoxemia in a patient affected by hepatic disease.All authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.
An Unusual Case of Recurrent Hypersensitivity Reaction Associated with Kounis-Like Acute Coronary Syndrome
1Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA2Cardiology, John D. Dingell VA Medical Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Shanker Kundumadam; ude.enyaw.dem@amudnuksReceived 8 May 2017; Accepted 19 July 2017; Published 27 August 2017Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2017 Shanker Kundumadam et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.There have been multiple reports of allergic reactions associated with acute coronary syndromes. This has been classically described as Kounis syndrome. We present an unusual case of 70-year-old male with multiple prior hypersensitivity reactions and history of coronary artery bypass grafting who presented recurrent episode of severe angioedema and anaphylaxis. He responded to epinephrine but subsequently developed a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with worsening heart failure. Our case is unique in that, unlike classic Kounis syndrome, the acute coronary event in this case did not present concurrently with the allergic reaction; rather it took nearly 48 hours to present. Subsequent angiogram revealed patent grafts and significant decline in the left ventricular systolic function as compared to his own ECHO a year ago. We postulate that slow mediators of inflammation may play a role in delayed development of acute coronary events with associated LV dysfunction following episodes of angioedema and anaphylaxis.We present a 70-year-old male with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and multiple episodes of recurrent angioedema and anaphylaxis. During his last admission, the patient developed a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with worsening left ventricular systolic dysfunction within 24–48 hours of admission. The angiogram revealed patent coronary grafts.A 70-year-old male with a past medical history significant for recurrent angioedema and anaphylaxis with no known etiology, coronary artery disease (s/p coronary bypass graft surgery in 2007), and systolic congestive heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35–40% presented to the hospital with an episode of severe angioedema and anaphylaxis. No specific trigger was identified for this event. Vitals on presentation were unremarkable with physical exam only significant for facial swelling and erythema. The remainder of the systemic examination was within normal limits. His initial EKG on presentation is shown in Figure 1. For the treatment of anaphylaxis, he received intramuscular epinephrine (with sodium metabisulfite preservative) in the ER to which he responded well. Of note, his previous episodes of hypersensitivity reactions were also treated with epinephrine with similar composition. He also received antihistamines and prednisone along with his home medications as aspirin, carvedilol, atorvastatin, and furosemide.On Day 2 of his hospitalization, the patient developed chest discomfort along with worsening of shortness of breath. His troponin U trended up from normal range on presentation to 8 ng/ml (normal < 0.80). The follow-up EKG is shown in Figure 2. The non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) clinical protocol was initiated and the patient underwent a coronary angiogram (Figures 3–5). Of note, the patient did not have any significant tachycardia after the epinephrine administration.The angiogram revealed severe native vessel CAD, patent coronary grafts with a calculated LVEF during the left ventriculogram estimated at 15%, a significant decline from his baseline LVEF of 35–40% a year ago. The patient was medically managed for systolic congestive heart failure and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, with clinical improvement. Allergy and immunology workup to identify particular triggers for the hypersensitivity reactions were negative. Workup on complement enzyme defects was also negative. The patient was later discharged home on appropriate medications with outpatient cardiology and allergy-immunology follow-up.There have been multiple reports of allergic reactions associated with acute coronary syndromes. This has been classically described as Kounis syndrome, which was first published in 1991 [1, 2]. There have been 3 types of Kounis syndrome described: vasospastic anginal form, known preexisting coronary atheromatous disease, and that associated with stent thrombosis [3, 4]. The vast array of cytokines released from mast cell degranulation, along with histamine, neutral proteases, tryptase, chymase, arachidonic acid products and platelet-activating growth factor have been postulated as the mediators responsible for these coronary events [1, 2, 5]. Most of the cases described in this context report acute coronary events, which happen alongside the allergic or anaphylactoid reaction. Our case is unique in that, unlike classic Kounis syndrome, the acute coronary event in this case did not present concurrently with the allergic reaction; rather it took nearly 48 hours to present. This finding implies that many other mediators, especially slow mediators of inflammation, may play a role in delayed development of acute coronary events along with left ventricular systolic dysfunction during episodes of angioedema and anaphylaxis.Treatments of such allergic reactions associated with acute coronary events necessitate addressing both these parts individually. This may pose a clinical challenge as many medications involved in treating acute coronary syndrome such as morphine, aspirin, and heparin can by itself trigger mast cell degranulation and precipitate coronary events. Epinephrine, used to treat allergic reactions, could also precipitate coronary events, which demands its cautious use especially in a patient with preexisting CAD. It is worthwhile to check serial troponins on these patients presenting with severe allergic reactions [6].The association of anaphylaxis, angioedema, and other allergic reactions with acute coronary syndromes is well documented and represents an entity known as Kounis syndrome. While three variants of this syndrome exist, our case exemplifies that there may be other previously undefined pathophysiologic mechanisms present. We describe a case of anaphylaxis and angioedema with delayed coronary event findings suggestive of the possibility of a late inflammatory response resulting in myocardial injury. To our knowledge, no previous documentation of this variant exists, warranting further research and studies in the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes secondary to such an event, particularly with focus on delayed mediators of inflammation.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
An Incidentally Detected Right Ventricular Pseudoaneurysm
1Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA2Department of Internal Medicine, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Aarti A. Patel; ude.fsu.htlaeh@51letapaReceived 18 April 2017; Revised 13 June 2017; Accepted 19 July 2017; Published 24 August 2017Academic Editor: Kuan-Rau ChiouCopyright © 2017 Vamsi C. Gaddipati et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Ventricular pseudoaneurysm is an uncommon, potentially fatal complication that has been associated with myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, chest trauma, and infectious processes. Diagnosis can be challenging, as cases are rare and slowly progressing and typically lack identifiable features on clinical presentation. As a result, advanced imaging techniques have become the hallmark of identification. Ahead, we describe a patient who presents with acute decompensated heart failure and was incidentally discovered to have a large right ventricular pseudoaneurysm that developed following previous traumatic anterior rib fracture.Cardiac pseudoaneurysms are a rupture of a blood vessel or myocardial wall that is contained by pericardium, thrombus, or adhesions [1]. They differ from true aneurysms as their walls do not contain myocardial tissue and they are connected to the ventricle by a small neck (rather than forming as a broad-based outpouching). Differentiation of the two is of paramount importance for management, however, as false aneurysms have a significantly higher propensity for fatal rupture [1, 2]. This complication, conversely, has not yet been reported in the right ventricle: it is unclear if this fact is related to lower right-sided pressures (and, accordingly, wall stress) or to simple epidemiological incidence [3].Indeed, while left ventricular pseudoaneurysms are a rare complication in and of themselves, right ventricular pseudoaneurysms are still more uncommon [4]. Following a literature review, published case reports of these right ventricular anomalies have been demonstrated to develop from lipoma [5], postcardiac surgery [6–9], following device lead extraction [10], in the infectious setting [11, 12], after remote myocardial infarction [2], as a complication of endomyocardial biopsy [3], and subsequent to penetrating chest wall trauma [13–15].Ahead, we report one such patient who develops a large right ventricular pseudoaneurysm following a remote anterior rib fracture due to motor vehicle collision.A 64-year-old African American man presented to a university hospital with one-week history of worsening dyspnea, cough, and lower extremity edema. He endorses frequently forgetting to take his medications as well as nonadherence with dietary and fluid restrictions. Past medical history is pertinent for morbid obesity, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (prior radiofrequency ablation, currently anticoagulated), coronary artery disease (prior stent to mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery), hypertension, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and previous motor vehicle collision approximately ten years prior.Upon arrival to the emergency department, he was noted to have blood pressure of 106/77 with heart rate of 94 and respirations of 23. He was saturating at 86% on 4-5 L nasal cannula and was subsequently started on Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) to improve respiratory status. Physical exam was notable for bibasilar crackles, grades II/VI holosystolic murmur, mildly elevated jugular venous pressure, and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Admission labs were unremarkable (including normal B-natriuretic peptide, troponin-I, and albumin). Chest X-ray demonstrated interstitial pulmonary vascular congestion (Figure 1), and EKG was sinus tachycardia with first-degree AV block. He was admitted to the cardiology inpatient service for continued management of presumed acute decompensated heart failure.Given the persistent hypoxemia, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) were ordered. TTE demonstrated normal biventricular systolic function, grade 2 diastolic dysfunction, and a small, 5 mm distal inferoseptal/apical VSD (Figure 2). CTPA was without evidence of pulmonary embolism but did demonstrate a  cm calcified lesion concerning for giant LAD coronary artery aneurysm (Figure 3), though image quality was limited by lack of gating. Diuresis was continued with symptomatic improvement, but given these findings, the decision was made to proceed with invasive angiography.Heart catheterization revealed elevated right-sided (right atrium (RA) 9 mmHg, right ventricle (RV) 52/12 mmHg, pulmonary artery 71/29 mmHg (mean 45 mmHg), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 mmHg), and left-sided pressures (left ventricle 183/31 mmHg, systemic arterial pressure 171/97 mmHg (mean 128 mmHg)) without evidence of step-up intracardiac RV shunt (RA 59%, RV 61% saturation). There was elevated cardiac output (Fick—11.1 L/min (index 4.39 L/min); Thermodilution—14.4 L/min (index 5.73 L/min). Coronary angiography revealed mild luminal irregularities only, with normal ejection fraction and no evidence of LAD aneurysm (Figure 4). There was no apparent mass lesion evident with fluoroscopy and ventriculogram showed normal left ventricular wall motion.Follow-up imaging was performed to elucidate these findings, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) clarified the anomaly as a  cm pseudoaneurysm arising from the mid-apical free wall of the RV with a 9 mm neck (Figure 5). Cardiac CT angiogram was well performed and confirmed pseudoaneurysm arising superiorly from the mid-apical free wall of the RV measuring up to 6.1 cm in maximal diameter with a 15 mm neck as well as  mm mid-apical VSD (Figure 6). A review of the previously performed CTPA was conducted at this point and revealed a previously healed rib fracture anterior to the pseudoaneurysm (Figure 7).Given the high output heart failure noted on angiography, an abdominal ultrasound was performed and revealed evidence of a cirrhotic liver. Upon further questioning, our patient admitted to prior longstanding alcohol abuse, now in remission. Remote motor vehicle accident was the presumed etiology to the rib fracture, and in the subsequent years, our patient developed RV pseudoaneurysm as well as VSD from the penetrating fracture. The patient was seen by cardiothoracic surgery for further evaluation, with plan to continue close surveillance per patient preference.Our case above describes incidental finding of RV pseudoaneurysm in a patient presenting with biventricular heart failure from elevated left ventricular filling pressures in the setting of cirrhosis and diastolic dysfunction. Initial imaging demonstrated no clear evidence of pseudoaneurysm or compressive effect upon the RV, and its discovery was contingent upon further evaluation by cardiac MRI. This imaging technique offers superior spatial resolution and tissue characterization when compared to TTE or nongated CT.As demonstrated by this case, pseudoaneurysm lacks a typical clinical presentation, with Yeo et al. reporting that 48% of lesions are found incidentally [1]. Symptoms are varied and may include mediastinal mass effect, thromboembolism, heart failure (or other signs of low cardiac output), arrhythmia, anginal-type pain, syncope, and catastrophic rupture [1, 3, 16]. These prognosticators are nonspecific, however, and progression of disease itself is typically insidious and involves slow growth [16]. Unfortunately, given the rarity of its occurrence, there is a paucity of large scale clinical series or trials that delineate appropriate history of disease, management, and survival data. As a result, diagnosis requires adequate visualization and an individualized approach to treatment and potential intervention.A multitude of imaging modalities exist for detection, from conventional echocardiography and contrast angiography to the novel CT and MRI techniques. Traditionally, echocardiography is a first-line test due to its wide availability and routine usage. Recognition of pseudoaneurysm, however, is contingent upon ability to visualize the ostium of the connecting orifice; continuous and pulse wave Doppler as well as color flow mapping are potential alternatives but regrettably have limited sensitivity [2, 4, 17]. Though angiography is historically the standard, cardiac CT and MRI offer new, noninvasive technique, high spatial resolution, tissue characterization, and improved visualization of segments that may be difficult to see on echocardiography [4]. In our own case, as outlined above, these procedures proved vital towards accurate diagnosis.While optimal management remains unclear, reduction of rupture incidence is the primary goal. Towards this end, it has been reported that medical treatment of chronic pseudoaneurysm (defined as lasting >3 months) is not associated with increased risk for mortality [1]. It is possible that there may exist a stabilizing effect of previous pericardial adhesions (to contain progression of growth) in this particular cohort where acute rupture is avoided [15]. In the specific instance of right ventricular involvement following motor vehicle collision, it has as well been hypothesized that there is decreased frequency of persistent right heart failure due to decreased right-sided wall strain affording a protective factor towards morbidity and mortality [14]. As a result, the benefits of aggressive surgical intervention for asymptomatic right ventricular pseudoaneurysm remain a topic of debate. Though innovative techniques such as percutaneous closure of left and right-sided ventricular pseudoaneurysms are a possibility [18], course of action, particularly in high risk patients, should be personalized.Cardiac pseudoaneurysms are a potentially fatal condition that require appropriate identification and surveillance. Given the challenge of diagnosis, index of suspicion and suitable imaging studies are a necessity for treatment. Novel cardiac imaging techniques including cardiac MRI and coronary CT angiogram should be strongly considered when clinically indicated.This case was previously presented in an abbreviated format as an abstract/poster presentation at the American College of Cardiology’s 66th Annual Scientific Session & Expo in Washington, DC (ACC.17, March 2017).The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Isolated Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava, Sick Sinus Syndrome, and Challenging Pacemaker Implantation

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Persistent left superior vena cava with absent right superior vena cava is a very rare venous anomaly and is known as isolated PLSVC. It is usually an asymptomatic anomaly and is mostly detected during difficult central venous access or pacemaker implantation, though it could also be associated with an increased incidence of congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, and conduction disturbances. Herein, we describe a dual-chamber pacemaker implantation in a patient with isolated PLSVC and sick sinus syndrome.Combination of persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) and absence of right superior vena cava, known as isolated PLVCS, is a very rare anomaly in adult patients. The incidence of congenital cardiac anomalies and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias is increased as well. Due to difficulties in invasive procedures, both clinicians and sonographers should be alerted to the possible presence of this combined venous anomaly and cardiac arrhythmias. A 63-year-old female was admitted to our cardiology department after experiencing a collapse. She was diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome and scheduled for a dual-chamber pacemaker implantation. Echocardiography showed a dilated coronary sinus (CS), suggesting PLSVC, and contrast echocardiography from the left arm vein showed early CS opacification, before the right atrium and right ventricle. A contrast enhanced computer tomography study confirmed persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) and absent right superior vena cava. A bridging vein drained the right jugular and right subclavian veins and joined the left brachiocephalic vein in order to form the PLSVC. The PLSVC drained into the right atrium via a dilated CS (Figure 1). Leads were placed through the left subclavian vein. Subclavian vein access was performed via direct puncture; the guide-wire was advanced through left subclavian vein to PLSVC and CS to right atrium. Instead of classic lead delivery system, advanced left ventricle lead delivery system for CS cannulation catheter (Medtronic Attain Command + SureValve, Minneapolis, USA) was used to reach the right atrium through CS, for lead placement. Leads were actively fixed in the right atrium (Medtronic CapSureFix MRI active fixation 58 cm lead, Minneapolis, USA) and right ventricle apex with alpha loop configuration (Medtronic CapSureFix MRI active fixation 58 cm lead, Minneapolis, USA). Excellent stimulation and sensing parameters (0.5 V/0.5 V ms for both electrodes, P wave 3 mV, R wave 8 mV) were achieved on both electrodes.The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications. A chest X-ray obtained after procedure showed satisfactory lead positioning and no pneumothorax (Figure 2). At follow-up, she was noted to be in good health and her pacemaker was functioning normally.PLSVC is the most frequent variation of the thoracic venous system, with a prevalence of 0.3–0.5% in general population [1]. PLSVC as a single superior vena cava, in the absence of right superior vena cava, that drains the cephalic portion of the body including upper extremities is much rarer, occurs in 0.09–0.13%, and is known as isolated PLSVC [2].Presence of a dilated CS on echocardiography should alert the clinician towards the possibility of PLSVC. Computer tomography (MDCT and venography) will confirm the diagnosis [3].It is also known that patients with PLSVC have higher incidence of arrhythmias and congenital heart defects [4, 5]. Lenox et al. have found sinoatrial node abnormalities in some patients with absent right superior vena cava [4]. The incidence of congenital cardiac anomalies is increased with absence of the right superior vena cava, such as atrial and ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarctation, and cor triatriatum [6].Right ventricular lead placement via the PLSVC and CS can be technically challenging due to the anomalous anatomy [7]. Serious complications have been reported when a guide-wire or catheter is manipulated via PLSVC, such as angina, arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, and even cardiac arrest [2]. The use of advanced lead delivery systems and longer leads to reach right atrium and ventricle is needed. In our case, we have used advanced left ventricle lead delivery system for CS cannulation catheter, which enabled us to easily reach the right atrium and provided us more possibilities for manipulation. Also considering preshaped stylet, forming loop within the atrium and active fixation of leads should be kept in mind in order to overcome difficulties. If implantation is impossible despite using multiple techniques, transcatheter pacing system (leadless pacemaker) could be considered.Although mostly clinically silent, undiagnosed PLSVC can lead to catastrophic consequences during invasive procedures. If PLSVC is suspected, the anatomy of the thoracic venous system must be identified before invasive cardiac procedures.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.
Electromagnetic Interference from Swimming Pool Generator Current Causing Inappropriate ICD Discharges
1Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine, Dayton, OH, USA2Good Samaritan Hospital, Dayton, OH, USA3University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA4Dayton Heart and Vascular Hospital, Dayton, OH, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Edward Samuel Roberto; moc.cam@otrebormasReceived 22 February 2017; Revised 30 June 2017; Accepted 24 July 2017; Published 23 August 2017Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2017 Edward Samuel Roberto et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Electromagnetic interference (EMI) includes any electromagnetic field signal that can be detected by device circuitry, with potentially serious consequences: incorrect sensing, pacing, device mode switching, and defibrillation. This is a unique case of extracardiac EMI by alternating current leakage from a submerged motor used to recycle chlorinated water, resulting in false rhythm detection and inappropriate ICD discharge. A 31-year-old female with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and Medtronic dual-chamber ICD placement presented after several inappropriate ICD shocks at the public swimming pool. Patient had never received prior shocks and device was appropriate at all regular follow-ups. Intracardiac electrograms revealed unique, high-frequency signals at exactly 120 msec suggestive of EMI from a strong external source of alternating current. Electrical artifact was incorrectly sensed as a ventricular arrhythmia which resulted in discharge. ICD parameters including sensing, pacing thresholds, and impedance were all normal suggesting against device malfunction. With device failure and intracardiac sources excluded, EMI was therefore strongly suspected. Avoidance of EMI source brought complete resolution with no further inappropriate shocks. After exclusion of intracardiac interference, device malfunction, and abnormal settings, extracardiac etiologies such as EMI must be thoughtfully considered and excluded. Elimination of inappropriate shocks is to “first, do no harm.”Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED), which include permanent pacemakers (PPM) and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), are widely used with increasing applications. Sensing circuitry inside these devices is made to detect cardiac rhythms, but they can also sense environmental signals [1]. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) includes any electromagnetic signal that can be detected by device circuitry and can potentially cause many undesirable effects on CIEDs [2, 3]. Effects of EMI on ICD operation can be varied from no effect to detrimental- incorrect diagnostics, abnormal sensing and pacing, device mode switch, and inappropriate defibrillation [4]. We describe here a unique case of extracardiac electromagnetic field interference from generator current at a public swimming pool, which resulted in false rhythm sensing and inappropriate ICD discharge.A 31-year-old female with bicuspid aortic valve, inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) status post-ICD placement presented after an inappropriate ICD shock. She had Medtronic Secura DR-D224, dual chamber ICD implanted in 2011. Since the device placement, the patient never received defibrillation or cardioversion. Her ICD functioned appropriately at regular follow-ups and remote monitoring.On the day of admission, the patient was sitting submerged in a public swimming pool. All of a sudden, she felt an electric shock which she described as getting hit at the back of the head. She had no preceding palpitations, loss of consciousness, or chest pain. The sensation reoccurred several times within a short period. The patient realized that she was being shocked by her ICD and immediately left the pool to seek medical attention.Intracardiac electrograms revealed a repetitive, high-frequency artifact on the ventricular channel interwoven with regular atrial and ventricular sensing (Figure 1). Electrical artifact was incorrectly sensed by the device as ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation and subsequently delivered a 30-Joule shock. Electrophysiologist reviewed the intracardiac recording and noted the signal was repetitive at exactly 120-millisecond intervals (Figure 2), raising high suspicions for alternating current from an external source. There was no evidence of device malfunction, fracture, or failure as all other device and lead parameters were within normal limits. Diagnostic information revealed ventricular sensitivity of 0.30 mV, R-waves of 4.8 mV, with ventricular lead and shock impedances of 342 and 68 Ohms, respectively. With device failure and intracardiac sources excluded, electromagnetic interference was therefore strongly suspected.Further investigation revealed there was a submerged electric motor, which recycles the chlorinated water in and out of the swimming pool. It was subsequently discovered that there was a leak in current due to faulty grounding, which acted as the current source for electromagnetic field interference. Patient was instructed to avoid the EMI source and, thereafter, did not experience any further inappropriate ICD discharges, confirmed at repeated follow-up.The efficacy of ICDs in extending survival in appropriately selected patient populations has been demonstrated in primary and secondary prevention trials. Inappropriate ICD shocks due to supraventricular arrhythmia are independent predictors of mortality [5]. 829 patients were followed by Poole et al. for a median follow-up duration of 4 years. That study showed that both appropriate and inappropriate shocks predicted increased mortality [6]. Appropriate shocks were associated with hazard ratio of 5.68 and inappropriate shocks were associated with hazard ratio of 1.98. Both findings were statistically significant [7]. Data on mortality from inappropriate shocks due to EMI are lacking and inconclusive.Whenever patients present due to ICD device firing, the device must be interrogated and the physician must review the intracardiac tracings carefully. The decision of whether it is an appropriate or inappropriate shock will have a huge influence on the prognosis and further management options. Careful thought must be given in consideration to etiologies of all kinds, both intra- and extracardiac. Inappropriate ICD shocks are due to inappropriate sensing. Abnormal sensing of supraventricular tachycardia such as atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of inappropriate ICD shocks. However, electromagnetic interference and intracardiac lead dysfunction should also be considered.Equipment malfunction encompasses lead fracture, lead displacement, lead chattering, and inappropriate settings and must be excluded before proceeding with other troubleshooting. ICD interrogation reports must be reviewed carefully. Sudden increase in lead impedance is most often due to lead fracture. Sudden drop in lead impedance is most often from insulation breakdown. After that, chest X-ray must be reviewed to exclude lead displacement or perforation. Sensing and pacing thresholds must also be checked. In our patient’s case, normal pacing thresholds and lead impedances distinguished this EMI from lead integrity issues.After exclusion of the intracardiac interference, device malfunction, and abnormal device settings, extracardiac interference such as EMI must also be excluded. Low threshold of suspicion must be present to diagnose EMI. In our patient, the intracardiac electrogram (Figure 1) clearly showed regular, repetitive artifact which is rapidly oscillated at every 120 milliseconds in both leads.EMI is defined as oversensing of extraneous signals that adversely affect the functioning of cardiac implantable electronic devices [2, 3]. EMI can elicit undesirable responses from implanted pacemakers and defibrillators, leading to potentially devastating consequences. For example, in patients who are in complete heart block with no underlying escape rhythm, EMI can be inappropriately sensed as cardiac signals leading to asynchrony or inhibition of pacing and bradycardia or asystole. In the atria (in DDD mode) these signals can cause tracking in the ventricle leading to tachycardia. “Atrial arrhythmia” detection can lead to mode switch to VVI or DDI mode. Among patients who have ICDs, the signals can be sensed as originating in the ventricle, leading to inappropriate ICD shocks.In a study by Occhetta et al. [7], investigation of inappropriate ICD shocks revealed seven cases due to external EMI. The sources noted in the study were an improperly grounded electric stove, electrically powered water system, hydromassage bath, electric pruner, electrocautery, and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation. Other sources of EMI include security devices at the airport and malls, ignition systems of running motor vehicles, arc welders, electricity grids, household leakage current from improper grounding, high voltage power coils, and magnetic resonance imaging machines [8]. In our case, the alternating current leakage from the submerged electric motor in the swimming pool interacted with the ICD, resulting in an inappropriate shock.Overall, the incidence of EMI to modern devices is low, as device technologies are constantly being developed and improved. Multiple manufacturers now have different signal detection algorithms to appropriately detect and avoid any inappropriate therapies. Current generation ICDs have built-in complex noise rejection algorithms, which reject nonphysiologic noise in the cases of lead fracture. The objective is to avoid inappropriate shocks while safely defibrillating the patients when needed. Medtronic’s Lead Noise Algorithm and St. Jude Medical’s SecureSense work by ensuring that ventricular sensed electrograms should be present both on RV pace-sense channel and on shock channels. If oversensing is only present on sense channel and not on shock channel, both algorithms withhold therapy. Dynamic Noise Detection is another noise rejection algorithm that is available in the newer generation Boston Scientific devices and separates the signals into low band and high band based on frequency. This potentially can prevent EMI from outside sources.Several primary and secondary prevention trials have demonstrated the efficacy of ICDs in extending survival in an appropriately selected patient population. Inappropriate ICD shocks due to supraventricular arrhythmia are independent predictors of mortality. Data about survival among patients with inappropriate ICD shock due to EMI is lacking. Nevertheless, EMI remains an important potential source of inappropriate therapy with resultant psychological trauma.For every ICD shock, the device must be interrogated. The device parameters must be reviewed carefully to make sure there is no device malfunction due to defective leads. Even after that, care must be taken to ensure that there is no abnormal sensing or inappropriate shock. Important causes of inappropriate shock include external interference such as EMI and intracardiac mechanical interference such as lead chattering. Inappropriate ICD shocks will continue unless they are recognized and solved. Inappropriate shocks inflict huge psychological trauma to the patient since the patient is shocked wide awake. Therefore, elimination of such occurrences is in keeping with our oath that is primum non nocere meaning “first, do no harm.”All authors declare no conflicts of interest.
Chagas Cardiomyopathy Presenting as Symptomatic Bradycardia: An Underappreciated Emerging Public Health Problem in the United States
1Department of Internal Medicine, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, 8900 Van Wyck Expressway, Jamaica, NY 11418, USA2Department of Cardiology, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, 8900 Van Wyck Expressway, Jamaica, NY 11418, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Richard Jesse Durrance; moc.liamg@ecnarrudessejReceived 13 February 2017; Accepted 18 July 2017; Published 16 August 2017Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2017 Richard Jesse Durrance et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM) is traditionally considered a disease restricted to areas of endemicity. However, an estimated 300,000 people living in the United States today have CCM, of which its majority is undiagnosed. We present a case of CCM acquired in an endemic area and detected in its early stage. A 42-year-old El Salvadoran woman presented with recurrent chest pain and syncopal episodes. Significant family history includes a sister in El Salvador who also began suffering similar episodes. Physical exam and ancillary studies were only remarkable for sinus bradycardia. The patient was diagnosed with symptomatic sinus bradycardia and a pacemaker was placed. During her hospital course, Chagas serology was ordered given the epidemiological context from which she came. With no other identifiable cause, CCM was the suspected etiology. This case highlights the underrecognized presence of Chagas in the United States and the economic and public health importance of its consideration in the etiological differential diagnosis of electrocardiographic changes among Latin American immigrants. While the United States is not considered an endemic area for Chagas disease, the influx of Latin American immigrants has created a new challenge to identify at-risk populations, diagnose suspected cases, and provide adequate treatment for this disease. Chagas cardiomyopathy is a vector-borne parasitic infection caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi [1]. With the highest parasitic disease burden described in the Americas, the World Health Organization estimates that there are 5–8 million people infected with chronic Chagas disease worldwide [2, 3]. The disease is endemic in Latin America and is the leading cause of nonischemic cardiomyopathy in the region [4].The infection is most commonly transmitted by insects of the Reduviidae family at blood meal bite sites but may also be transmitted vertically from mother to child, through blood transfusions, organ donation [5], and anecdotally in outbreaks from oral consumption of contaminated food products [6]. After the acute infection, the disease progresses to an indeterminate form, with 20–30% of individuals progressing to symptomatic cardiac manifestation of the disease after 15–25 years [1]. Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM) most commonly presents as conduction system abnormalities, dilated cardiomyopathy, and apical aneurysms with consequent thrombus formation and embolization [7]. Chagas disease in nonischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with worse outcomes [8], and the clinical consequence of CCM can be seen in a study which found that that T. cruzi positive patients had a significantly higher prevalence of arrhythmias, severe heart failure, and mortality with respect to their seronegative peers [9]. Life expectancy of patients living with symptomatic CCM is less than 30% at 5 years [9].While Chagas has traditionally been considered a disease restricted to areas of endemicity, the ever-increasing mobility of populations across regions and borders has changed disease distribution dynamics [5]. There are an estimated 300,000 people living in the United States with Chagas today [2], the vast majority of which are suspected to have acquired the disease in the endemic areas from which they emigrated.In this paper, we present a case of Chagas cardiomyopathy acquired in an endemic area, detected in its early stages of chronic manifestation and before the classic late-stage morphologic changes to the myocardium. This case is representative of the underappreciated prevalence of the disease and its consequences in an area with a large immigrant population of Latin American origin.A 42-year-old El Salvadoran woman presented to the ED after a syncopal episode. The patient’s symptoms began with left sided chest pain radiating to her left arm followed by dizziness. She had loss of consciousness for 5 minutes and had suffered multiple syncopal episodes with increasing frequency over the past year. She was advised to see a cardiologist for slow heart rate but did not follow up. She denied palpitations, vision or hearing changes, or seizure activity.The patient grew up in rural El Salvador and immigrated to the United States 10 years ago. Of note, her sister of 40 years of age, who currently lives in El Salvador, also recently began suffering similar episodes over the past 2 years.On examination, her blood pressure was 105/66 mmHg and was found to be bradycardic; her heart rate fluctuated between 30 and 42 beats per minute. The patient’s lungs were clear. There was no lymphadenopathy or peripheral edema. Investigations showed negative serial troponin levels and normal hematologic and blood chemistry tests. The patient’s electrocardiogram was remarkable for sinus bradycardia, with conserved axis and segment intervals and no other conduction abnormalities (Figure 1). Chest X-ray was normal. Her cardiac ultrasound showed an ejection fraction of 62% (Figure 2). The patient was diagnosed with symptomatic sinus bradycardia. A pacemaker was placed.During her initial hospital course, a first Chagas serology test was ordered given the fact that the patient had no other identifiable causes or risk factors for cardiomyopathy beyond the epidemiological context from which she came. This result came back positive after discharge, and the patient was followed up as an outpatient for a confirmatory second serology, which was also positive. Without any other clear etiology, it is suspected that Chagas was the cause of the cardiomyopathy.It was agreed upon by the medical team that, given the seropositive status of the patient with only electrocardiographic evidence of disease and no appreciable cardiomegaly or congestive changes, antiparasitic treatment should be offered. This issue was discussed at length in follow-up visits with the patient. While she initially expressed interest in receiving pharmacological treatment, she has been persistently hesitant to commence therapy. This remains an active discussion with the patient.This case highlights several key points as a result of the underrecognized prevalence of Chagas in the United States and the importance of considering Chagas in the etiological differential diagnosis of electrocardiographic changes among Latin American immigrants. Two clear issues that must be addressed from the clinical and public healthcare stewardship standpoint are the fact that the patient has 4 children who could potentially be seropositive and in the indeterminate phase and must therefore be screened and the fact that the patient has no macroevidence of CCM, and the question remains of whether or not to offer her treatment that could change the course of disease.One key aspect of this case is recognizing the heterogeneity of the endemic nature of Chagas. In the case of El Salvador, the country of origin of this patient, the countrywide prevalence is 3.37% [10], third in Latin America [2]. The problem transcends in the erroneous assumption that this prevalence is equal countrywide. In the same report issued by the ministry of health of El Salvador, the area from which our patient emigrated has recent reports of seropositivity greater than 20%, largely related to the distribution of the vector and the rural environment [10]. In this sense, it is important to understand that not all immigrants can be considered under the same criteria due to the microcosm from which they come and that the sociological and geographic details of their history are of paramount importance to the adequate treatment of these patients.Additionally, there is an inherent obligation from the part of the medical profession in the United States to maintain an index of suspicion for Chagas, as it is frequently underappreciated by the immigrant population as well, as was observed in a study in Latin American immigrants living in Los Angeles [11].Chagas disease follows a biphasic progression in which the acute phase typically culminates in a 4- to 8-week mild febrile illness and skin welt at the site of infection. This gives way to an indeterminate phase, of which 20–30% of infected persons will evolve to become symptomatic in 15–25 years with CCM [1, 12]. The earliest manifestations are alterations of the myocardial conduction system, resulting in left anterior fascicular block, right bundle branch block, bradyarrhythmias, and high grade A-V blocks, which are accompanied by symptoms like presyncope and syncope, atypical chest pain, exertional dyspnea, and palpitations [9]. When evaluating our patient across the different proposed Chagas classification criteria [13], the appearance of electrocardiography abnormalities seen in our patient with a preserved ejection fraction >45%, intermediate disease progression is implied. Additionally, parasympathetic dysautonomy has been found to exist without gross morphologic or electrocardiographic evidence of CCM and has been suspected to be involved in the higher incidence of sudden cardiac death seen in chronic seropositive Chagas patients [14]. These changes could account for the baseline regularity of the bradycardia as well as the multiple episodes of syncope and presyncope seen in our patient [15] and, along with the chronic inflammatory and autoimmune activity triggered by T. cruzi, are suspected to play an important part in the more commonly recognized morphologic changes of the myocardium resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure [1].While there is clear indication that treatment of Chagas disease in the acute phase has proven efficacy [16], there is still a lack of consensus with respect to the treatment of the indeterminate and chronic phases of Chagas disease. On one hand, parasite related outcomes (seroconversion) are shown to improve after treatment in the chronic phase of disease [17]. However, the change in disease course is still a matter of debate [1, 18, 19].The only large scale trial to date showed that while treatment in patients with established CCM reduced serum parasite detection, a reduction in cardiac clinical deterioration was not appreciated over the following 5 years of follow-up [18]. However, this study has been criticized for its heterogeneity, low benznidazole dose, and lack of control of multiple confounding factors [19–22]. It also only provides definitive evidence for those with established CCM [18, 19]. There is, however, observational evidence that antitrypanosomal treatment can slow the progression of the disease. Viotti et al. showed that, in a randomized but nonblinded prospective follow-up of patients with established Chagas disease, those treated with a course of benznidazole had significantly less disease progression and mortality over an average of almost 10 years of follow-up [23]. Another recently completed longitudinal study of 310 patients with chronic Chagas disease in the indeterminate phase showed that after a mean of 19-year follow-up, the cohort treated with benznidazole had significantly less ECG changes, lower all-cause mortality, and lower cardiac related mortality after controlling for confounding cardiac risk factors [24].In consideration of the side-effect profile of antitrypanosomal treatment, a Cochrane review found that severe side effects occurred in 2.4% of patients to benznidazole, with mild skin reactions, severe GI intolerance, lymphadenopathy, neuritis, and fever, while nifurtimox carried a 6.7% incidence and included neuritis and hepatitis [17]. Therefore, given the available evidence, current World Health Organization consensus recommends offering antitrypanosomal treatment to all patients in the indeterminate phase of the disease as long as risk and benefits are clearly explained [16], as was offered in this case.Regarding prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with CCM presenting with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias, placement of a pacemaker, as was done in this patient, follows best practices guidelines established in areas in which Chagas is endemic [25]. In the case of ventricular arrhythmias and significant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, placement of an ICD in previously symptomatic individuals has been shown to have a protective effect against sudden cardiac death in the albeit limited evidence available [26, 27] and is recommended in clinical guidelines of areas of endemicity [25].Vertical transmission of Chagas disease from a seropositive mother to offspring carries a risk of 5% [28, 29]. As outlined by Bern and Montgomery, the incidence of congenital Chagas is projected to be equivalent to that of phenylketonuria [2], a condition for which screening has already been proven to be cost-effective and has been incorporated into the prenatal screening algorithm. The WHO recommendations state that Chagas serology screening should be done in all newborns of seropositive mothers, as well as their siblings; and treatment should be offered to all children and, as previously stated, adults in the indeterminate phase [16].An economic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of screening versus no screening done in Spain, a nonendemic area with Latin American immigrants like the United States, showed that antenatal screening of Latin American mothers, their offspring in positive cases, and consequent treatment resulted to be more cost-effective than not screening when projecting the long-term healthcare costs a seropositive person would place upon the system [30]. This is supported by an economic analysis of the annual healthcare cost burden of Chagas in the United States, which was estimated at an average of 2,162 USD annually [31]. If we take into consideration that our patient has 4 children and has an unknown time of infection with Chagas, coupled with the vertical transmission rate, it is in the best interest of the patient, her family, and the economic wellbeing of the healthcare system to realize screening serology on her children and treat accordingly if seropositive. This not only has the opportunity to improve patient outcomes but also supports significant cost-savings for the healthcare system.While the United States is not considered an endemic area for Chagas disease, the significant influx of immigrant populations from Latin America has created a new challenge to identify susceptible populations, diagnose suspected cases, and provide adequate treatment for this disease. The opportunity to carry out appropriate population based screening and offer secondary and tertiary prevention of disease progression is emblemized by this case and is an area that offers the opportunity to improve population-directed patient care and cost-effectiveness of healthcare delivery.Although there is inconclusive evidence regarding the etiologic treatment of the indeterminate form of Chagas disease, small studies have reported a decrease in disease advancement after treatment. This is an area that should continue to be investigated in the future. With respect to prevention of sudden cardiac death, current guidelines for pacemaker placement prove to be beneficial.Finally, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the realization of screening to suspected cases, especially during the indeterminate form, as in the children of the index patient in this case, would lead to a substantial savings for the healthcare system.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Special thanks are due to Dr. Farshad Bagheri of the Infectious Disease Department of Jamaica Hospital for the valuable insight and Maria del Pilar Fernandez for insight and guidance during manuscript preparation and to the patient and her family for their disposition to participate and follow through.
The Use of a Novel Heart Failure Agent in the Treatment of Pregnancy-Associated Cardiomyopathy
Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Adam J. Cohen; ude.fsu.htlaeh@1nehocaReceived 25 April 2017; Accepted 9 July 2017; Published 14 August 2017Academic Editor: Magnus BaumhäkelCopyright © 2017 Vamsi C. Gaddipati et al.

Its etiology is presently unknown, but current standard of care involves the use of typical drug therapy for the treatment of heart failure. Pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy (PACM) is a similar condition that refers to patients who develop such symptoms prior to the last month of pregnancy. We report the case of a nulliparous Caucasian female who develops early, severe PACM during her first pregnancy with postpartum persistence of New York Heart Association class II-III symptoms despite medical therapy. The use of the novel heart failure agent, sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto), is initiated with near-complete resolution of her symptoms.Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is an uncommon pathology for pregnant women that can produce severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Its diagnosis may be obfuscated as many symptoms are identical to those of normal pregnancy; accordingly, practitioners must have a high index of suspicion given the potentially fatal prognosis. Current standard of care involves treatment with the typical medication regimen for other forms of heart failure (HF). Ahead, we report the case of a 24-year-old Caucasian female who develops severe biventricular dysfunction early in her first pregnancy. Although her HF persists during the postpartum period, we describe the usage of a novel heart failure agent, sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto), to near-complete resolution of her symptoms.A 24-year-old Caucasian female presented to the Emergency Department at 17 weeks and 3 days of gestation of her first pregnancy with a two-month history of worsening dyspnea and lower extremity swelling. She noted progressively worsening symptoms over the prior two months to the point where she was unable to lie flat. She had no past medical history, and initial vital signs were notable for HR of 129, BP 117/85, RR 22, and SpO2 of 100% on room air. Physical exam demonstrated bilateral lower extremity pitting edema to the ankles, S3 gallop, and elevated jugular venous pressure. Initial laboratory values were remarkable for a mild transaminitis (AST 113 IU/L, ALT 189 IU/L) and a B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 1191 pg/mL. Presenting electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with left axis deviation, and computed tomography pulmonary angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism. Transthoracic echocardiogram was pertinent for LV ejection fraction (EF) of 15–20% with severe global hypokinesis, grade 3-4 diastolic dysfunction, severe right ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 70 mmHg. Accordingly, she was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for management of new-onset biventricular HF.Concurrent with aggressive diuresis, continuation of pregnancy was discussed extensively with the patient in tandem with the Obstetrics service. After electing to proceed, she was initiated on furosemide, hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and carvedilol. Work-up of the cardiomyopathy, unfortunately, did not reveal a clear etiology as viral serologies were negative and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated no evidence of edema, inflammation, or other alternative explanation. Following this admission, the patient was discharged home in stable condition and seen in clinic weekly with multiple repeat echocardiograms not demonstrating any significant improvement. Attempts to uptitrate her medical therapy were limited by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III HF and symptomatic hypotension.She presented for elective Caesarian section at 30 weeks and 3 days of gestation, which was completed without perioperative complication. Her recovery, however, was extended due to postoperative respiratory failure and decompensation necessitating Swan-Ganz catheter placement and transient inotropic support with dobutamine in conjunction with nitroprusside infusion. Cautious weaning led to discharge on carvedilol and enalapril (and cessation of hydralazine and ISDN).Afterwards, she unfortunately reported continued fatigue and lethargy. Although her HF clinically appeared compensated, repeat echocardiography performed approximately two months following delivery was again without improvement. The Seattle Heart Failure Model calculator estimated a mean survival of approximately 9 years, and her case was referred to Transplant Cardiology for further evaluation and early establishment. Genetic testing for sarcomere mutations was performed and again did not evince clear alternative etiology to the cardiomyopathy.Given her refractory symptoms, the decision was made to attempt initiation of Entresto. Despite an initial HF exacerbation during the transition process that necessitated brief hospital admission for diuresis, the patient reported increased energy level, no further episodes of lightheadedness or dizziness, and minimal dyspnea within approximately one week. Though blood pressure in the clinic setting appeared similar to before, she reported improved ambulatory pressures with no longer needing to hold doses of her medications for hypotension. Titration of medications and BNP trend are reported in Table 1 and Figure 1.She has done well thereafter and continues to be closely followed with cautious titration to optimal medical therapy. No further symptoms have been reported in 15 months of follow-up and LV EF has improved to 35–40% with resolution of right ventricular dysfunction.In the presentation described above, our patient would be categorized as pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy (PACM) as she was diagnosed early in pregnancy. Though this disease process is not as well studied, it has been suggested to be phenotypically identical to PPCM and without clinical differences in presentation, management, or prognosis [1]. Accordingly, the two will herein be considered synonymous.During pregnancy, hemodynamic and hormonal changes affect cardiac output, vascular relaxation, and thrombogenesis in addition to a variety of systemic metabolic parameters [2]. These changes may manifest into a variety of symptoms—fatigue, dyspnea, edema, chest pain, and so forth—that can be difficult to distinguish from the pathologic presentation of PPCM. Accordingly, this first challenge of diagnosis is paramount and requires a thorough history and physical examination in conjunction with high index of suspicion, biochemical laboratory markers, and imaging techniques. Criteria for diagnosis itself include the following: (1) development of HF in the last month of delivery or within 5 months of delivery; (2) the absence of a determinable etiology for HF; (3) absence of demonstrable heart disease before the last month of pregnancy; (4) LV systolic dysfunction demonstrated by LVEF < 45%, fractional shortening < 30%, or both [3].Within the United States, the incidence of PPCM has been approximated at 0.3%, though with higher rates amongst the African American ethnicity [3]. In addition, it occurs with greater incidence in women with increased age, multiparity, and preeclampsia [4]. Familial clustering of PPCM has been noted, and ongoing studies suggest a potential genetic component to the development of this pathology [5, 6]. For this reason, there is a suggestion that the disorder is a subset of dilated cardiomyopathies that are evinced during the partum period. Potential pathogenetic basis has been theorized as abnormal autoimmune response, apoptosis, impaired cardiovascular microvasculature, systemic angiogenic imbalance, and oxidative stress [4, 6]. Given the discrepancy in manifestation and prognosis, however, the disease process is likely an interaction between multiple intrinsic mechanisms.With known potentially fatal implications, outcome and prognosis remain an important focus of study. The Investigations of Pregnancy-Associated Cardiomyopathy study demonstrated that the majority of women (72%) recover EF, particularly those without significant remodeling (LV end-diastolic diameter < 6.0 cm) or severe LV dysfunction (LV EF ≥ 30%) [7]. Poorer outcomes have been associated with increased LV end-diastolic diameter, systolic blood pressure < 110 mmHg, and heart rates > 100 [8]. This latter subgroup was largely unable to tolerate goal dosages of beta blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i) therapy. Cardiac MRI, as well, is a burgeoning field for the assessment of cardiac structure and function that has been suggested to display some prognostic implication in the setting of PPCM. The presence of late gadolinium enhancement may be associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and is congruent with higher relapse rates of heart failure in patients with persistent low EF [9]. Its usage during pregnancy, however, has been recommended by the American College of Radiology only if essential [3].Current treatment is yet an evolving field, but standard of care is analogous to management of other types of HF (i.e., includes low-salt diet, fluid restriction, blood pressure control, loop diuretics, ACE-i or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy, beta blockade, nitrates, and hydralazine) [10]. Anticoagulation, defibrillators, and advanced therapies (mechanical assist devices or heart transplantation) are as well approached in a similar manner [11]. The efficacy of experimental therapies such as pentoxifylline and immunoglobulin is equivocal and remains under further investigation [3, 10, 11]. A promising current contemporary agent is bromocriptine, which prolongs prolactin inhibition and thereby reduces its antiangiogenic and proapoptotic effects [11, 12]. Early initiation in conjunction with typical medical therapy may improve prognosis in pilot studies and studies of HF recurrence in repeat pregnancies [13], but a greater level of evidence is still required prior to widespread adoption.In our case above, we elected to proceed with initiation of a novel HF agent, Entresto, on the basis of results from the PARADIGM-HF trial [14]. While bromocriptine was as well provided, its introduction followed reported improvement in symptoms; furthermore, the dosage was not titrated to that used in the above investigations. It would appear that the driving factor for enhanced quality of life in this example was Entresto, suggesting a potential benefit in HF not limited to the archetypal presentation.PPCM and PACM are potentially fatal conditions that require timely identification and treatment given their long-term sequelae and prognostic implications. While the usage of standard drug therapy for HF is the gold standard at present, novel agents may provide symptom relief in a subset of patients who are unable to tolerate the typical regimen. Further studies are needed to better ascertain optimal management of these high-risk patients.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection: A Rare Manifestation of Alport Syndrome
University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Sanford USD Medical Center, Sanford Cardiovascular Institute, Sioux Falls, SD, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Amornpol Anuwatworn; moc.liamg@nrowtawunaaReceived 30 April 2017; Revised 16 June 2017; Accepted 9 July 2017; Published 14 August 2017Academic Editor: Monvadi Barbara SrichaiCopyright © 2017 Amornpol Anuwatworn et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Alport syndrome (AS) is a genetic disorder due to inheritance of genetic mutations which lead to production of abnormal type IV collagen. AS has been associated with renal, auditory, and ocular diseases due to the presence of abnormal alpha chains of type IV collagen in the glomerulus, cochlea, cornea, lens, and retina. The resulting disorder includes hereditary nephritis, corneal opacities, anterior lenticonus, fleck retinopathy, temporal retinal thinning, and sensorineural deafness. Aortic and aortic valve pathologies have been described as extrarenal manifestations of AS in multiple case reports. One case report described intramural hematoma of the coronary artery. We report the first case of true spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) with an intimal flap as a very rare manifestation of AS. The patient is a 36-year-old female with history of AS with chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and obesity who presented to the emergency room with acute onset of substernal chest pain radiating to her neck and arms. Troponin was elevated, and ECG showed transient 1 mm ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads. Subsequent coronary angiography revealed localized dissection of the left circumflex artery. Percutaneous coronary angioplasty was performed and her symptoms improved. This case illustrates that SCAD may be a manifestation of AS patients with chest pain.Alport syndrome (AS) is a genetic disorder due to the inheritance of multiple defective genes which lead to production and deposition of abnormal type IV collagen [1]. AS has been associated with renal, auditory, and ocular disease owing to the presence of alpha chains of type IV collagen in the glomerulus, cochlea, cornea, lens, and retina resulting in spectrum of hereditary nephritis [2], corneal opacities, anterior lenticonus, fleck retinopathy, temporal retinal thinning [3], and sensorineural deafness [4]. AS has also been associated with significant aortic disease including dissection and aneurysm [5]. One case of coronary intramural hematoma has been reported [6]. We report the first case of true spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) with an intimal flap as a very rare manifestation of AS.A 36-year-old woman with X linked AS (COL4A5, very rare heterozygous nonsense mutation-c.1117C>T, p.Arg373stop in exon 19), chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and obesity presented to the emergency room with the acute onset of substernal chest and neck pain. Chest pain was associated with exertion. Her pain radiated to both arms and was associated with numbness. She did not have a past history of oral contraceptive pill use and was not pregnant at this time. She was previously prescribed lisinopril for hypertension; however her blood pressure was poorly controlled due to noncompliance in taking her medication over the past month. Her blood pressure was 150/100 mmHg six weeks prior to the admission.The patient was diagnosed with AS at 23 years of age when she was being considered as a kidney donor for her brother. The diagnosis of AS was confirmed by genetic test and renal biopsy. She was asymptomatic at that time and had no renal, ocular, or auditory manifestations of AS. Later, she developed chronic kidney disease and hypertension. She denied a history of tobacco use/abuse. There was a family history of AS in her brother with AS who underwent two renal transplantations.On physical exam she had a temperature of 36.3°C, a blood pressure of 152/100 mmHg, a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute. Repeat blood pressure in the ER was 138/88 mmHg. ECG showed transient 1 mm ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). The serum troponin I was 28 ng/ml (normal range 0–0.01 ng/ml). Serum creatinine was 2.19 mg/dL.Heparin and aspirin were promptly administered. A decision was made to perform emergent coronary angiography, which showed a localized dissection (red arrow in Figure 1(a)) of the mid left circumflex coronary artery. This dissection resulted in a luminal compression of the coronary artery leading to 40% narrowing of its lumen. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty and drug eluting stent placement (blue arrow in Figure 1(b)) were successfully performed. Echocardiography revealed a normal ejection fraction with mild inferolateral wall hypokinesis. She improved clinically with resolution of the chest pain. Following the procedure, she received aspirin, prasugrel, metoprolol tartrate, amlodipine, and atorvastatin. During the hospitalization, her blood pressure was in the range of 118–141/64–89 mmHg.Six months after procedure she presented to a clinic with a complaint of dyspnea on exertion and atypical chest pain. An exercise stress test with echocardiography did not demonstrate ischemia.AS is an inherited disorder affecting alpha chains of type IV collagen. There are multiple mutations and modes of inheritance possible including X linked, autosomal recessive, and autosomal dominant [1]. X linked is the most common accounting for approximately 85% of cases with the COL4A5 mutation being found on the X chromosome [1, 7]. The COL4A5 gene encodes the α5 chain of type IV collagen. These mutations lead to impairment of the production, deposition, and function of collagen type IV alpha chains.AS has been predominantly associated with renal, auditory, and ocular diseases owing to presence of alpha chains of type IV collagen in the glomerulus, cochlea, cornea, lens, and retina [1]. The α5 and α6 chains of type IV collagen are also found in the basement membranes surrounding vascular smooth muscle cells in the intima and media of aorta and other arteries in mice model. Seki et al. believed that α5 and α6 chains of type IV collagen in the basement membranes may have particular function in the arteries which are required to tolerate strong pulse and blood pressure such as the aorta [8]. This may explain the potential mechanism of aortic and coronary complications in AS.Extrarenal manifestations of AS have been reported with many types of aortic and aortic valve pathologies [5]. AS was associated with aortic abnormalities including aortic dilatation, ruptured ascending aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, aortic insufficiency, and bicuspid aortic valve in male patients [5, 9]. In a wild-type mouse model, staining for α5 chain of type IV collagen was observed in the aorta. On the contrary, no α5 chains of type IV collagen in the aortic media were seen on immunostaining in mice with X linked AS due to a nonsense mutation in the COL4A5 gene. However, there was no aortic pathology seen in these Alport mice. These findings suggested that a lack of α5 chain of type IV collagen in the aortic media may be a potential predisposing factor of aortic disease but other contributory variables are needed to produce the clinical manifestation of aortic pathology [5].Our review of literature has found one case of coronary intramural hematoma in 65-year-old female patient with AS and hypertension who was treated conservatively. We also reviewed another case of giant coronary aneurysms of the left circumflex artery and the right coronary artery in a 50-year-old male with history of AS, hypertension, and smoking presenting with ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest [10]. In our case, we report the first SCAD with a presence of an intimal flap in the left circumflex artery. Coronary intramural hematoma has been one of the presumed precursors of SCAD [11].SCAD is typically described as a nontraumatic separation of coronary arterial wall that is not caused by an atherosclerotic process [11, 12]. It has been associated with multiple connective tissue disorders including Marfan syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome, fibromuscular dysplasia, Loeys–Dietz syndromes, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition it occurs in multisystem inflammatory or immunologic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, Crohn’s disease, sarcoidosis, and polycystic kidney disease [13, 14]. Moreover, SCAD is associated with the pregnant and postpartum states, vigorous physical exercise, blunt chest trauma, drug abuse (like cocaine), and hormonal therapy.Local stress and shearing may be important contributing factors contributing to the development of SCAD [13]. Vulnerable coronary vessel walls have been proposed as potential mechanism of SCAD. For instance, in pregnancy and postpartum related SCAD, hemodynamic stress due to increase in blood volume and prothrombotic state play a predisposing role. In addition, estrogen is related to an increase in matrix mucopolysaccharides, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and decreased collagen production. In connective tissue diseases, the coronary arterial wall is weakened by medial degeneration [15].Based on the concept of vulnerability of coronary vessel walls, we propose that the presence of defective type IV collagen represents a predisposing factor which when combined with localized shearing forces to the coronary wall produced by fluctuating and uncontrolled hypertension may lead to intimal tearing of the coronary arteries and the pathogenesis of SCAD in AS. However, this remains speculative as it is unsafe to obtain coronary artery biopsies in human subjects. Future studies with coronary artery biopsy in mice model with COL4A5 gene mutation would be helpful to further investigate this proposed mechanism.At this time there is no consensus on treatment guidelines for SCAD. The treatment options include a conservative approach versus revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting [13, 14]. A decision regarding the management should be based on the severity of the presentation, evidence of ongoing ischemia or infarction, and the risk of possible PCI-related complications [16]. The patient we present was treated with a drug eluting stent and has been without complications for three years.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.Article processing charge is funded by the Cardiovascular Disease Fellowship Program at the University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine.

Sequential Venous Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty and Balloon Dilatation of the Interatrial Septum during Percutaneous Edge-to-Edge Mitral Valve Repair
University Hospital, Department of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, GermanyCorrespondence should be addressed to Harald F. Langer; ed.negnibeut-inu.dem@regnal.dlarahReceived 8 May 2017; Accepted 9 July 2017; Published 9 August 2017Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2017 Rezo Jorbenadze et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (PMVR) is widely used for selected, high-risk patients with severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR). This report describes a case of 81-year-old woman presenting with severe and highly symptomatic mitral valve regurgitation (MR) caused by a flail of the posterior mitral valve leaflet (PML). PMVR turned out to be challenging in this patient because of a stenosis and tortuosity of both iliac veins as well as sclerosis of the interatrial septum, precluding the vascular and left atrial access by standard methods, respectively. We managed to achieve atrial access by venous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and balloon dilatation of the interatrial septum. Subsequently, we could advance the MitraClip® system to the left atrium, and deployment of the clip in the central segment of the mitral valve leaflets (A2/P2) resulted in a significant reduction of MR. Percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (PMVR) has proven to be beneficial for patients with severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR), who are not eligible for conventional mitral valve repair. PMVR, however, can turn out to be challenging. For instance, anatomical variations of vascular access and sclerosis of the interatrial septum in some patients may represent obstacles, which render the procedure more challenging.We report the case of an 81-year-old woman, who was admitted to our hospital with progressive dyspnea for further clinical evaluation. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed severe MR with normal left ventricular systolic function. An eccentric jet was caused by a flail of the posterior leaflet (PML) in segment P2 (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease (CAD). Our interdisciplinary heart team recommended PMVR because of the high risk of open surgery in this patient.After establishing vascular access through the right femoral vein, we were not able to advance the transseptal needle through the introduced Preface® transseptal access sheath (Biosense Webster, CA) across an obstruction at the curvature of the tortuous iliac veins. Instead, we had to use a thin transseptal guidewire (SafeSept®, Pressure Products, CA), which was advanced through the transseptal access sheath. This SafeSept wire has a very sharp tip and requires 77% less force to cross the interatrial septum. Using this approach, we then switched to a more rigid transseptal guiding sheath (LAMP, St. Jude Medical), and left atrial access could finally be achieved by dilatation of the interatrial septum with gradually increasing sizes of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) balloons (up to 5 mm) over the SafeSept wire (Figure 1(c); Supplemental Movie 1 in Supplementary Material available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/3652413). Subsequently, we experienced another obstacle, as the dilator of the MitraClip steerable sheath system (Abbott Vascular) could not be advanced to the inferior vena cava over the placed ultrastiff wire (Amplatz, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN), even when using a second superstiff buddy wire (Amplatz, Boston Scientific Corporation, San Jose, CA) (Figures 1(d), 1(e), and 1(f); Supplemental Movie 2). Furthermore, the left iliac vein had a similar obstruction precluding advancement of the MitraClip system. Thus, we carried out successive balloon dilatations of the right common iliac vein with gradually increasing balloon sizes up to 10 mm (Figure 1(g); Supplemental Movie 3). Deployment of the clip (Figures 1(h) and 1(i)) in the central segment of the mitral leaflets (A2/P2) resulted in a significant MR reduction (Figure 1(j)). We could discharge the patient from the hospital with a significantly improved 6-minute walk test few days after PMVR.PMVR presents a novel and innovative method for interventional mitral valve repair for patients with MR, who are not eligible for conventional heart surgery [1]. Less invasiveness and no need for extracorporeal circulation represent major advantages of PMVR over open heart surgery [2]. In some patients, however, anatomical circumstances may render PMVR difficult and in some cases even impossible. Besides difficult vascular access, existence of an atrial septal defect (ASD), a sclerotic interatrial septum, or a relatively small left atrium with additional presence of a prominent coumadin ridge, which can make stirring towards the mitral valve plane difficult, can complicate and prolong the procedure. If a significant ASD is present, the position of the MitraClip steering guide may not be stable enough. Crossing the iliac veins with the MitraClip guide catheter can represent a challenge during PMVR. Recently, a case of venous strangulation during PMVR was presented, which was overcome by implantation of a stent [3]. In our case, we were able to manage this vascular obstruction by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) using PTA balloons of gradually increasing sizes. Multiple studies have shown that anticoagulation is needed after iliac venous stenting and sometimes even additional antiplatelet treatment is necessary for prevention of recurrent deep venous thrombosis [4]. In contrast, our approach has the advantage where no prolonged antithrombotic therapy is required. In addition to anatomical variation of the iliofemoral veins, thickening or lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum can represent a challenge for achieving the left atrial access. There are different methods for transseptal puncture, for example, by using radiofrequency or excimer laser catheters. Radiofrequency or laser energy can be helpful for transseptal puncture of a scarred, calcified, or patched atrial septum [5]. However, in our case we achieved the left atrial access via a SafeSept transseptal guidewire, a LAMP rigid transseptal guiding sheath, and gradual dilatation of the interatrial septum with PTCA balloons. We performed the transseptal puncture and the whole PMVR procedure under the guidance of TEE and fluoroscopy. However, intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) can also be used for monitoring of the intervention [6].In conclusion, balloon angioplasty may be necessary for successful positioning of the MitraClip system and should be kept in mind as an option for establishing both vascular and left atrial access during PMVR.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

Its prevalence in the general population is 0.1 to 0.5%. LSVC is 5 times rarer when accompanied by an absence of the right superior vena cava (RSVC). We present the case of a 54-year-old man who carries a persistent LSVC without RSVC. Clinically, this patient presented a regular bradycardia at 40 per minute associated with a heart failure syndrome. The electrocardiogram diagnosed a complete atrioventricular block and transthoracic echocardiography showed dilated left heart cavities and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%. During the procedure of pacemaker implantation, the probe followed an unusual LSVC-coronary sinus-right atrium path and it was not easy to pass through the tricuspid orifice. We propose a review of the literature on this subject, focusing on the clinical implications of this malformation in cardiac stimulation and in other areas of cardiology.The persistence of LSVC was described for the first time in 1738 by Le Cat. It is the most common congenital anomaly of systemic venous return with a prevalence ranging from 0.1 to 0.5% in the general population [1]. It can be isolated or associated with other congenital heart diseases. Usually, it does not pose a haemodynamic problem. This abnormality can be encountered in various circumstances including cardiac surgery and any intervention including catheterization of the right cardiac cavities [2]. We report in this article a case of persistence of the LSVC detected during a pacemaker implantation. After a brief presentation of the clinical case, we will review the existing literature on the subject. Finally, we will talk about the lead’s placing technique into the right ventricle during pacemaker implantation in this situation.We report the case of a 54-year-old man, a former smoker who complained of dyspnea and dizziness. Physical examination noted blood pressure at 170/80 mmHg and signs of heart failure and regular bradycardia at 40 per minute. The diagnosis of complete atrioventricular block with wide QRS complex (complete right bundle branch block) was made on the electrocardiogram. Transthoracic echocardiography showed moderately dilated left cardiac cavities (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter at 62 millimeters), high left ventricular filling pressure, and a dilated inferior vena cava. There was no pulmonary arterial hypertension.We decided to implant a cardiac pacemaker and the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization room. After its introduction into the left cephalic vein, the right ventricular pacing lead descended along the left side of the spine following the path of a LSVC and entered the right atrium through the coronary sinus (Figure 1). The attempt to ascend the stimulation lead into the RSVC starting from the right atrium failed, suggesting the persistence of LSVC with absence of RSVC.Once in the right atrium, it was necessary to make a loop with the lead in order to reach the tricuspid orifice, remove the curved guide, replace it by a straight guide, pass through the tricuspid valve, and screw the lead into the right ventricle. A good stimulation threshold of 0.4 volts and a sensitivity of 12 millivolts were obtained intraoperatively and were maintained over a minimum period of 6 months after implantation. Clinically, the patient showed no signs of heart failure and hemodynamics remained stable during successive checks.Development of the superior vena cava system begins with the sinus venosus, the main venous formation in which 3 pairs of cardinal, umbilical, and vitelline veins are discharged. The right cardinal vein is transformed into RSVC, the left cardinal vein into LSVC, and the left part of the sinus venosus into the coronary sinus. In normal embryogenesis, there is progressive involution and disappearance of the left cardinal vein by extrinsic compression of the left atrium and the left hilum. An incomplete regression of the left cardinal vein will lead to the persistence of the LSVC [3]. Its prevalence ranges from 0.5% in the general population to 5% in congenital cardiopathy carriers and 4% in patients undergoing electrophysiology for a rhythm disorder [4]. In subjects with LSVC, RSVC is frequently present in 80% of cases [5]. Its absence means that all blood of superior system vena cava (2 subclavian veins and the 2 internal jugular veins) flows into LSVC and a coronary sinus often dilated. This situation has rarely been reported with a prevalence ranging from 0.07 to 0.13% of patients with congenital or acquired heart disease [6]. In the Dan Adams study about 26 LSVC carriers operated for congenital heart disease between 1968 and 1973, LSVC had entered the right atrium in 77.3% of cases compared to 22.7% flowed into left atrium [7]. The implications of LSVC’s persistence will be discussed in the context of pacemaker implantation and in others areas of cardiology.Although this venous return abnormality has important clinical implications, it has no particular symptom and is hemodynamically well tolerated. LSVC’s connection with left atrium produces a right-left shunt with severe cyanosis. LSVC can prevent the placement of a central catheter in patients with cancer as well as cardiac catheterization to measure right cardiac chambers’ pressures. Realization of a mediastinal surgery without being aware of LSVC’s existence can lead to dangerous hemorrhagic complications [8]. LSVC has been incriminated in the genesis of atrial fibrillation but also in atrioventricular conduction disorders [9].Presence of LSVC makes the implantation of a cardiac pacing lead into the right ventricle particularly difficult. The explanation for this difficulty is that the ostium of the coronary sinus is not aligned with the tricuspid orifice and that a loop must be made before a lead can pass the tricuspid valve. Many techniques have been proposed to facilitate this passage [10–13].The first technique has been summarized in 4 phases with a total duration of 1 to 4 minutes:(i)Advance the lead with a straight guide until it crosses the coronary sinus and enters the right atrium.(ii)Replace the straight guide with a preformed J-guide (conventionally used for the right atrial lead) and position the lead against the lateral or anterolateral wall of the right atrium.(iii)Remove the guide, 3–5 cm.(iv)Then push the probe which forms a loop and passes easily the tricuspid orifice [3]. This technique has given excellent results in literature in terms of passage of the lead through the tricuspid valve with good stimulation and detection’s parameters [14, 15] without making it necessary to restart the procedure on the opposite side. A resumption of the procedure on the right would be a failure if there was as in the clinical case absence of the RSVC.A second technique involves the use of a 9 F sheath which can be guided to the tricuspid orifice and allow the lead to be deployed [14]. The first technique has been used in our case. We believe that a sheath is more traumatic than a lead and irritation of the coronary sinus could cause arterial hypotension, angina pain, or even cardiac arrest [2]. A dilated right atrium may increase the difficulty of passing a lead through the tricuspid valve regardless of the method used. However, LSVC facilitates the implantation of a left ventricular lead during the placement of a triple chamber pacemaker. Persistent LSVC is rare and generally discovered in adult cardiology during a pacemaker implantation. However, LSVC may be strongly suspected in transthoracic echocardiography in presence of an abnormally dilated coronary sinus [16]. The subsequent injection into a left antecubital vein of an emulsion, made by saline serum or glucose serum, will successively lead to opacification of the dilated coronary sinus and the right atrium. In contrast, an injection of emulsion in a right antecubital vein would have opacified the right cardiac cavities without previously opacifying the coronary sinus [17, 18]. This simple, noninvasive procedure is easy to apply because it just requires an echocardiograph.We reported a clinical case of persistent LSVC with absence of RSVC. This malformation has implications in cardiologic practice during a pacemaker implantation and in other areas of cardiology. Different techniques can be used to facilitate the passage through the tricuspid valve of a cardiac stimulation lead in this situation. Transthoracic echocardiography can detect this malformation prior to any procedure with which its existence may interfere.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Leukemic Ischemia: A Case of Myocardial Infarction Secondary to Leukemic Cardiac Involvement
Florida Hospital, Orlando, FL, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Dzmitry Fursevich; moc.liamg@dm.hcivesruf.yrtimzdReceived 30 April 2017; Accepted 9 July 2017; Published 7 August 2017Academic Editor: Kuan-Rau ChiouCopyright © 2017 Dzmitry Fursevich et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We report a case of a 39-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain while being in remission from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Cardiac markers were elevated and EKG revealed ischemic changes compatible with acute myocardial ischemia. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) showed calcium-free coronary arteries and soft tissue myocardial infiltration suggestive of cardiac leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed recurrence of T-ALL, and patient was successfully treated with chemotherapy. We discuss the prospective diagnosis of myopericardial leukemic involvement and the role of CCTA in diagnosis and perform a literature review.In postmortem studies of lymphocytic neoplasms, cardiac involvement by leukemia and lymphoma has been reported in 8.7% to 37% cases [1]. Reports of antemortem leukemic cardiac infiltration are scarce, and in the few cases described T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is rarely the offender. We present a unique case of T-ALL manifesting as a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), conduct a literature review, and highlight the diagnostic role of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).A 39-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain 1.5 years after initial diagnosis of T-ALL. At the time of diagnosis, the bulk of his extramedullary disease was in the chest, primarily involving the anterior and middle mediastinum. The patient was successfully treated with radiation, chemotherapy, and double umbilical cord blood transplant, with complete response to therapy. His remission status was monitored by periodic bone marrow biopsies.At the time of ED presentation, the patient complained of acute onset dull chest pain. His troponin T was elevated at 0.2 ng/ml (normal <0.03 ng/ml). EKG showed lateral lead T-wave inversion without ST-segment elevation (Figure 1), consistent with a NSTEMI. A CCTA showed calcium-free coronary arteries; however, there was extensive soft tissue infiltration of the right atrium, atrioventricular (AV) groove, lateral myopericardium, and lateral pericardium (Figure 2). The AV groove infiltration resulted in approximately 50% narrowing of the proximal left circumflex artery. Echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) also demonstrated lateral left ventricular wall thickening, and leukemia recurrence was suspected. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed T-ALL recurrence.The patient was treated for NSTEMI with beta-blockade and aspirin and was immediately given methotrexate, vincristine, pegylated asparaginase, and dexamethasone chemotherapy regimen. A follow-up chest CT 5 months later demonstrated marked decrease in soft tissue cardiac and pericardial infiltrate, and repeat CMR showed focal scarring along the lateral left ventricular wall (Figure 3). Bone marrow biopsy confirmed complete response to therapy.Our report illustrates a unique case of T-ALL recurrence which presented with chest pain, EKG changes, and elevated cardiac enzymes. Additionally, it is remarkable that leukemia recurrence was suggested prospectively by the CCTA findings of LCx narrowing and soft tissue infiltration of the lateral left ventricular wall. Only a few reports of antemortem diagnosis of cardiac T-ALL have been discussed in the literature. For example, Prenner et al. reported a case of T-ALL initially presenting with fatigue and dry cough, with echocardiogram and CMR findings of anterolateral left ventricular involvement and decreased left systolic function [2]. De Lazzari et al. described a case of large granular lymphocyte leukemia presenting with anasarca and left ventricular dilatation, inferolateral myocardial involvement, and severe systolic dysfunction [3]. Barbaric et al. reported a case of B-cell ALL with a large leukemic right ventricular mass incidentally detected on routine pretreatment echocardiogram [4]. None of these cases utilized CCTA as the initial imaging modality of choice, and the former two required endomyocardial biopsy for diagnosis.In our case, the diagnosis of leukemia was suggested prospectively based on the CCTA images. While there was no imaging evidence of infarction, we speculate that patient’s symptoms, EKG changes, and elevated cardiac enzymes were caused by either (a) LCx narrowing, (b) microvascular obstruction from direct leukemic myocardial invasion, (c) focal pericardial invasion resulting in focal pericarditis, or (d) a combination of the previous factors. More importantly, CCTA was able to detect all of these abnormalities and suggest the diagnosis of T-ALL recurrence prospectively. It also suggested that 50% stenosis of LCx was related to extrinsic infiltration of the vessel rather than intraluminal plaque, obviating the need for cardiac catheterization and guiding immediate diagnostic workup and therapy for disease recurrence.CCTA has become the initial modality of choice in many chest pain units [5], mostly used for evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). It has continuously demonstrated excellent performance in CAD detection: meta-analyses of several studies utilizing 64-slice CT scanners reported sensitivities between 85 and 99% and specificities between 86 and 96% [6–9]. A prospective multicenter trial comparing the 64-slice CCTA with myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) concluded that CCTA is superior to MPI in detection of >50% coronary artery stenosis [10]. The detection of noncoronary findings on CCTA has also been well recognized, with meta-analysis of 13 studies of a total of 11,703 patients reporting overall prevalence of extracardiac findings as high as 41% [11, 12]. Besides highlighting a unique case of chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes which were ultimately treated with chemotherapy regimen, our report illustrates yet another reason to consider CCTA in lieu of other diagnostic techniques for chest pain workup in the emergency setting.The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma with Unusual Cardiac Metastasis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature
1Department of Internal Medicine, University of Toledo Medical Center, 3000 Arlington Avenue, MS 1150, Toledo, OH 43614, USA2Department of Cardiology, University of Toledo Medical Center, 3000 Arlington Avenue, MS 1150, Toledo, OH 43614, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Abhinav Tiwari; ude.odelotu@irawit.vanihbAReceived 3 March 2017; Accepted 4 July 2017; Published 6 August 2017Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2017 Abhinav Tiwari et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Alveolar soft part sarcoma is a very uncommon soft tissue malignancy which accounts for <1% of soft tissue sarcoma. It is a malignant and highly vascular tumor arising most commonly in the musculature of the lower extremities, with metastasis primarily to the lungs, bones, and brain. Cardiac metastasis is very rare and only 5 cases have been reported in the literature so far. We report a case of a young woman with a history of surgically resected alveolar soft part sarcoma of left thigh who presented with persistent dry cough and was found to have a cardiac mass, which on biopsy proved to be alveolar soft part sarcoma.Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare soft tissue neoplasm that accounts for less than 1% of all soft tissue sarcomas [1] and affects individuals between 15 and 35 years of age primarily, with a slight female preponderance [2]. In adults, the most common site is the deep soft tissues in the thigh or buttock. However, it is known to occur in organs such as lungs, breasts, stomach, female genital organs, and bones [3, 4]. It is a malignant and highly vascular tumor, and metastases to the lungs, bones, and brain are common while cardiac metastasis is extremely rarely [5, 6]. We report a case of a young woman who had history of ASPS of the left thigh which was resected. She presented one year later with a dry cough and was found to have a cardiac mass, which on biopsy was consistent with ASPS.A 31-year-old female with a history of ASPS in the left thigh treated with neoadjuvant radiation followed by radical excision of the mass was seen one year later for dry cough of 1-month duration. She denied any chest pain, fever, or shortness of breath. Cough was refractory to over-the-counter cough suppressants. She had a normal chest X-ray and was even treated with a 5-day course of azithromycin by the primary care physician. On exam, she had normal lung sounds while cardiac examination revealed a 2/6 holosystolic murmur over the left heart border. Due to persistent nature of this cough, a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed that revealed a large (4.5 cm) right ventricular (RV) mass and pericardial effusion (Figure 1). She was referred to cardiology clinic, where a transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large right ventricular mass about 5 cm in size. She was then taken for right heart catheterization (RHC) to obtain a tissue specimen. Preoperative 2D echocardiogram confirmed a large 5.5 × 7.5 cm mass that was intimately associated with right ventricular free wall encroaching upon the AV groove and interfering with the tricuspid valve (TV) mechanism (Figure 2). On RHC, the pressure findings were consistent with the physiology of TV stenosis caused by obstructing mass. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 5 mm Hg, RV pressure was 25/3 mm Hg, the right atrial pressure was 14 mm Hg, and pulmonary artery pressure was 15/6 mm Hg. Pericardiocentesis was performed and 420 mL of hemorrhagic pericardial fluid was drained. Intraoperative frozen section of the RV mass was consistent with ASPS (Figure 3). Transcription factor E3 (TFE-3) immunostain revealed strong and diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity of tumor cells. The patient was transferred to a specialized cardiothoracic surgical center for intervention, where partial resection of the cardiac mass was performed.ASPS is a very uncommon soft tissue malignancy that was originally described by Smetana and Scott Jr. in 1951 as a malignant tumor of the nonchromaffin paraganglia [7]. Christopherson et al. later described it under the name of “alveolar soft part sarcoma” in 1952 [8]. ASPS accounts for <1% of soft tissue sarcoma and typically occurs in young adults with a female predominance [9, 10]. Although the most common site of the tumor is the musculature of the lower extremities [11], it is also known to occur in organs such as lungs, breasts, stomach, female genital organs, and bones [3, 4]. Typically, patients note a painless, slowly growing mass; however, some patients may present primarily with metastatic disease. It is an indolent and slowly growing tumor, but the overall 5-year survival is only 20% for nonresectable tumors [12, 13]. Despite being slow growing, it is a malignant and highly vascular tumor which metastasizes primarily to the lungs, bones, and brain, while cardiac metastasis is extremely rarely [5, 6]. Hematogenous dissemination which can occur long after resection of the primary tumor, even if there is no local recurrence [14–16].To the best of our knowledge, there have been five cases of cardiac metastases reported so far. Chen et al. reported a case of ASPS of left arm which 3 years later metastasized to heart, brain, lung, and spleen. The patient succumbed to cachexia and biopsy or resection of the cardiac tumor was not performed [17]. Akiyama et al. reported a case of ASPS of the right thigh which was surgically removed and later metastasized to lungs, brain, intestines, and heart [18]. Strecker et al. reported a case of ASPS of right thigh with brain and later cardiac metastases, which could be excised partially [19]. Campbell et al. described a case of surgically resected ASPS of the right forearm which later spread to lungs, heart, and brain. Cardiac lesion was asymptomatic and was not resected [20]. Finally, Stark et al. described a case of left thigh ASPS which was surgically excised; 5 years later, the patient presented with signs of congestive heart failure and was diagnosed with cardiac metastasis of the tumor, which was surgically resected [21].On imaging, the tumor is contrast enhancing due to its vascular nature [22]. ASPS tend to have high signal intensity on T1- to T2-weighted images on magnetic resonance imaging. On immunohistochemistry, ASPS is consistently positive for an antibody that detects carboxyl terminal of transcription factor 3 (TFE3) gene in the form of strong nuclear staining pattern [23, 24].Although rarely curative, the cornerstone of treatment remains surgical excision of the primary and isolated metastases [12, 18]. Radiotherapy should be added as a supplemental procedure if there is partial resection of the tumor, positive surgical margin, or presence of symptomatic metastasis. There is a limited role of chemotherapy in treating solitary lesion. However, in the presence of multiple metastases of the lungs, brain, spleen, or heart, chemotherapy may be considered a treatment option. There is a limited success with anthracycline based chemotherapy regimens but the overall prognosis of ASPS is poor. Kummar et al. treated 43 metastatic, unresectable ASPS patients with cediranib (30 mg) once daily in 28-day cycles, and it was observed that cediranib has substantial single-agent activity, producing an overall remission rate of 35% and a disease control rate of 84% at 24 weeks [12]. This trial is still ongoing.In conclusion, this is a case of ASPS with rare event of cardiac metastasis. The patient with cardiac metastasis can remain asymptomatic or may have subtle symptoms such as cough or dyspnea. Such patients may also present with signs of frank congestive heart failure [21]. Therefore, in a patient with treated or untreated ASPS, it is imperative to consider cardiac metastasis in addition to more common pulmonary metastasis if the patient presents with respiratory or cardiac symptoms.All authors have no financial conflicts of interest.
Symptomatic Long Pauses and Bradycardia due to Massive Multinodular Goiter

However, in patients with symptomatic sinus bradycardia, the identification and treatment of underlying pathologies may avoid the need for permanent pacemaker implantation. We present a case of carotid sinus syndrome and severe obstructive sleep apnea due to a massive multinodular goiter in a patient who presented with recurrent sinus pauses and syncope. The patient was managed without pacemaker implantation but instead with thyroidectomy resulting in decompression of the carotid sinus and airway and resolution of bradycardic episodes.Permanent pacemaker implantation is generally indicated in patients with symptomatic sinus node dysfunction. Such sinus node dysfunction may be the result of age related degeneration or secondary to ischemic, infiltrative, endocrinologic, or autonomic diseases [1]. Mass lesions of the head and neck, including multinodular goiters, have been reported to cause bradycardia, pauses, or syncope [2, 3]. Carotid sinus syndrome or autonomic dysfunction may occur when mass effect involves the carotid sinus baroreceptor, airway, or recurrent laryngeal nerve [2]. With surgical decompression or denervation, the cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor response to compression can be reversed [2, 3]. We present the case of a 55-year-old woman with recurrent sinus pauses and syncope who was found to have carotid sinus and airway compression from a massive multinodular goiter.A 55-year-old woman with history of bipolar disorder, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and multinodular goiter presented with recurrent syncope. The patient also endorsed nocturnal palpitations and several syncopal events associated with voiding. There was no previous history of arrhythmia, conduction disease, or known cardiac structural or functional abnormality. Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with normal atrioventricular nodal and ventricular conduction intervals including PR, QRS, and QTc at baseline. Her sinus rate was 70 to 80 beats per minute at rest. Laboratory analyses including electrolytes and thyroid function were unremarkable. However, inpatient telemetry monitoring demonstrated frequent episodes of sinus bradycardia which were asymptomatic and intermittent long sinus pauses of up to 9 seconds (Figure 1). These bradycardic events were most frequent and prolonged during sleep and when the patient was noncompliant with continuous positive airway pressure ventilation. Few episodes of sinus tachycardia were also recorded; however no other arrhythmias were present. She was not on any medication to suppress the sinus or atrioventricular nodes. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated normal cardiac structure and function.Computed tomography imaging revealed a massive goiter extending from the nasopharynx to aortic arch causing rightward tracheal deviation (9.1 × 6.1 × 10 cm in greatest dimensions, Figure 2). Given the potential reversibility of the inciting cause of bradycardia, permanent pacemaker placement was deferred. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy without intraoperative arrhythmia and had complete resolution of sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses, and symptoms. Tissue pathology of the thyroid gland was consistent with benign multinodular goiter. There was no infiltrative disease or malignant tissue invasion to carotid artery, except thyroid gland mass effect or external pressure to local neck structures including carotid. The patient remained in sinus rhythm at heart rate of 80–90 beats per minute during postoperative care. Cardiac monitoring showed no further brady- or tachyarrhythmia during follow-up (Figure 3).Carotid sinus compression by malignant masses has been previously described in the literature to produce both cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses [2–4]. Carotid sinus compression by a neck mass or the invasion of the tumor in patients with head and neck cancer can cause episodes of bradycardia and intermittent pauses. Carotid body tumors, local tumors such as thyroid cancers, cervical lymphadenopathy, postradiation fibrosis, and internal carotid artery aneurysms, are known to cause carotid sinus sensitivity [5–7]. Although the pathophysiology of this process is well-characterized, it is suggested to be associated with a permanent depolarization of neuronal axons with an increased sensitivity to impulses. However, it is extremely rare for multinodular goiter to cause carotid baroreceptor hypersensitivity leading to symptomatic sinus pauses and bradycardia. Here we present a case of symptomatic sinus pauses and bradycardia due to carotid baroreceptor compression by massive multinodular goiter.While ventricular demand pacing may be effective in managing cardioinhibitory responses, vasodepressor responses to carotid baroreceptor compression may limit pacemaker utility [3, 8]. In addition, significant vasodepressor symptoms may manifest only after ventricular pacing is instituted [3, 8]. In such patients, sequential atrioventricular pacing appears to alleviate vasodepressor symptoms thought to be caused by atrial contraction against a closed atrioventricular valve [8, 9].In this patient, the effect of carotid baroreceptor hypersensitivity was compounded by concomitant OSA with pronounced nocturnal bradycardia. The incidence of OSA is increased in patients with massive goiters and OSA is associated with a high burden of nocturnal bradycardia [10, 11]. This bradycardia is thought to be vagally mediated as electrophysiologic studies of patients with OSA are normal [11, 12]. Finally thyroidectomy appears to improve OSA in patients with massive goiter and improvement of OSA with CPAP attenuates nocturnal bradycardia [10, 11]. Therefore, it is plausible that the improvement of OSA by thyroidectomy in this patient helped alleviate her nocturnal bradycardia and sinus pauses. Notably, consistent with the majority of benign goiters, the patient was euthyroid [13].Our case also illustrates the importance of an investigation for reversible causes in the work-up of symptomatic sinus bradycardia and pauses. Mass lesions of the neck involving the carotid sinus or airway are a potentially modifiable cause of sinus bradycardia and sleep apnea. Removal of the mass may obviate the need for pacemaker placement. Awareness of those triggers and appropriate treatment of underlying causes are optimal therapeutic approaches for the patient with secondary sinus bradycardia and pauses.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Acute Heart Failure Exacerbation with Cardiogenic Shock and Elevated Systemic Vascular Resistance Treated with a Combination of Nicardipine and Dobutamine Therapy

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Acute heart failure is a common reason for hospital admission and is usually caused by decreased cardiac output either as a result of an intrinsic cardiac issue or as a result of severe hypertension with elevated afterload. We present a patient with a history of HFrEF who presented with acute heart failure, found to have hypotension requiring Dobutamine support and an elevated systemic vascular resistance requiring Nicardipine drip, with subsequent recovery of cardiac function.Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by a decrease in cardiac output with or without an increase in intracardiac pressure, which can be caused by structural or functional pathologies. One of the determinants of cardiac output (CO) is afterload, which is the force that the heart must overcome to pump blood to the body [1]. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is a measure of resistance of systemic vascular bed to blood flow and can be used to clinically monitor left ventricular afterload [2]. An elevated SVR can result in the inability to increase the stroke volume to match the body’s demand. In cases wherein the afterload is elevated and the heart cannot generate enough pressure to overcome it, heart failure decompensation can occur. We present a patient with longstanding hypertension who presented with heart failure exacerbation, with hypotension and elevated SVR.A 53-year-old lady with history of HTN, initially characterized by HFpEF which progressed to HFrEF, presented with heart failure exacerbation secondary to medication noncompliance. Vital signs on admission included temperature 98.6F, BP 127/83, HR 92, RR 18, and O2 sat 93% on 2 L nasal cannula. Echocardiogram showed a LVEF of 25–30% with Grade 2 diastolic dysfunction. Intravenous diuresis was initiated with development of hypotension. Dobutamine was started but was unable to be weaned off. Left heart catheterization revealed no evidence of CAD. Right heart catheterization results are shown in Table 1. Nicardipine drip was started as SVR was high. Dobutamine was uptitrated to maintain MAPs above 70 mmHg. Clinical response to the drip is shown under Days 2-3. As her MAPs were stable, she was weaned off Dobutamine by Day 3. Subsequently, Nicardipine drip was weaned off. Her fluid status continued to improve with diuresis. She was discharged and, on follow-up in clinic, is doing well.Heart failure has a prevalence of over 5.8 million people in the United States and greater than 23 million people around the world [3]. Patients with acute heart failure usually either have uncontrolled HTN with acute pulmonary congestion requiring vasodilator therapy or have hypotension, usually due to an intrinsic cardiac problem requiring inotropic support and/or mechanical assistance.This patient’s profile is a unique blend between a patient with hypertensive emergency presenting with heart failure exacerbation requiring vasodilators such as Nicardipine and someone in a low cardiac output state requiring inotropic support. The likely pathophysiology of this patient’s presentation is that she had a “hypertensive emergency,” because of her baseline reduced EF, resulting in the inability to compensate for the elevated SVR, which, in turn, resulted in hypotension. This is in line with the formula for Mean Arterial Pressure: MAP = CO  SVR.Vasodilators help with heart failure as they decrease left ventricular filling pressures. This can increase cardiac output as the stroke volume will increase due to decrease in SVR and then result in decreased myocardial oxygen demand [4]. Calcium channel antagonists can reduce SVR due to their vasodilatory effect in the short term. However, they are well known for their negative inotropic effects.Aroney et al. studied the inotropic effect of Nicardipine in acute heart failure. The study included 15 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (0.15 ± 0.02), NYHA II to IV. These patients received equihypotensive doses of IV Nitroprusside and IV Nicardipine. The patient’s baseline values were obtained followed by infusion of Nitroprusside, returning to a second baseline, followed by Nicardipine infusion. LV pressure volume loops showed a rightward shift with Nicardipine, suggestive of negative inotropic effect. Overall this study suggested an increase in Cardiac Index, decrease in SVR, and increase in LV ejection fraction with Nicardipine [5]. A study by Hirota et al. also showed increased cardiac output with Nicardipine infusion in patients with HFrEF exacerbation [6].Management of patients with such heart failure requires the use of vasodilators which help increase CO by decreasing SVR, with the aid of inotropes to maintain the BP as the SVR decreases. The above combination helped our patient to avoid chronic inotropic support and further advanced heart failure care including mechanical assist devices or heart transplant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which a patient with acute heart failure exacerbation with cardiogenic shock benefited from the combination of Dobutamine for inotropic support and Nicardipine for improvement in SVR.In patients with a known history of hypertensive heart disease presenting with acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock, a low cardiac output due to increased systemic vascular resistance may exist. Measurement of the SVR may lead to the use of vasodilator therapy, in combination with inotropes, which may lead to resolution of the heart failure.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Neuropsychological Outcome following Resuscitation after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A One-Year Follow-Up

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 61-year-old woman survived resuscitation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The heterogeneity of the resulting cognitive impairments and the recovery over a one-year period are presented, highlighting the need for standardized neuropsychological testing even after short cardiac arrests and for effective treatment both out of hospital and in hospital.Whereas about 22% of patients in the USA survive an out-of-hospital resuscitation [1, 2] with a 1.7-fold increase between 2006 and 2010, there are much less survivors in Germany [3]. Success of resuscitation depends on the space of time until onset of revivification and on the efficiency of the techniques applied [4, 5]. Only 15% of German bystanders intervene using cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) [6] compared to 60% in other countries [7].Short cardiac arrests of at least 10 minutes cause brain damage in regions with high neuronal vulnerability. The reduction of cerebral blood flow in peripheral regions (three-territory border), the need for oxygen of the neocortex, and rapid and delayed neuronal death caused by hyperstimulation of NMDA-receptors are relevant pathophysiological principles for neuropsychological outcomes [8]. Knowledge about cognitive outcomes is still limited nowadays and only about 5% of patients reach their premorbid cognitive base level one month after resuscitation [9]. About 20% to 60% suffer from long-lasting cognitive impairments. Mostly memory, attention, executive functions, and psychomotor functions are affected after cerebral hypoxia [10–12]. Patients present with heterogenous patterns of impairment [13–15].Recovery of functional impairments after a cardiac arrest continues for months, best progress occurring within the first six months [16]. Improvements of cognitive sequelae are described in the first three months after cardiac arrest with only marginal further improvements until 12 months after the incident [15, 17–19].A 61-year-old female suffered from cardiac arrest at home. Her husband started initial resuscitation in sense of CPR by bystander until arrival of the emergency physician. After the arrival of the physician ventricular fibrillation was treated with defibrillation. A resulting asystolia was changed into ventricular tachycardia applying norepinephrine. Adding amiodarone, a sinus rhythm was gained and kept stable. On arrival at the clinic mask breathing was changed into endotracheal intubation. Mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) was initiated, lasting for 24 hours. The patient was extubated after 48 hours. Electrocardiogram presented a stable sinus rhythm without ST-segment deviation or channelopathies (Brugada syndrome, early repolarization syndrome, and long QT syndrome). The echocardiography showed a nearly unimpaired left ventricular contractile function. Neither a pericardial effusion nor a valvular heart defect could be found.The patient was investigated with head computed tomography (CT) scan because of anisocoria. Cerebral hemorrhage could be excluded. A thoracic CT scan showed neither pulmonary embolism nor aortic dissection. An obstructive coronary artery disease has been excluded by a coronary angiography. A neurological examination revealed problems of temporal orientation.Since the anamnesis did not reveal any cardiac illness and the actual physical examinations did not show a cardiomyopathy, an idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) was diagnosed. Since IVF has a high recurrence rate and drug treatment is ineffective [20], an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was placed. This medical approach is based on the guidelines of secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death.The patient underwent a neuropsychological assessment which is usually applied in our clinical setting. Considering the guidelines of the German Neurological Society (DGN) [21] examinations of memory should record immediate span, working memory, and delayed recall of both verbal and visual information, as well as a learning paradigm. Attention should be recorded in different terms of selectivity and intensity [22]. Executive functioning is recommended to be checked in at least four ways: working memory, monitoring, cognitive fluency, and flexibility as well as planning and problem solving [23]. The tests used are commonly applied in clinical practice. They are adapted and standardized for the German language area, fulfilling required psychometric standards. The assessment has been conducted shortly before ICD was implanted as well as six and twelve months after the implantation. To examine intrapersonal effects the critical difference [24–26] was computed. The level of significance was set at , one-sided (raw data, Table 1).Verbal memory examination (VLMT, versions A, C, and D) covered immediate memory span, short-term and long-term retention (free recall and recognition), and learning capacity [27]. The VLMT is a German version of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test.Immediate span was not affected at all. The patient underachieved in terms of short-term and long-term retention (recall and recognition) at the first trial. At the half-year follow-up all scores revealed a significant improvement, which stayed stable until the one-year follow-up.Short-term memory was checked by a block-tapping test (WMS-R) [28] comparable to the Corsi block-tapping task, forward and backward, long-term retention by the delayed reproduction of the Rey complex figure [29], and parallel versions (modified Taylor figure [30], MCG Complex figure  [31]). A significant improvement of performance from the baseline to the half-year follow-up in both conditions of the block-tapping test was observed, whereas the forward condition revealed a further significant increase after 12 months. Though long-term retention showed no impairment at the baseline, there was a significant increase of performance after 6 months persisting until the one-year follow-up.Attention was recorded by different subtests of a computerized attentive test battery (TAP) [32]. “Alertness” and “Vigilance” were the subtests used for measuring intensity. “Divided attention” and “Go/NoGo” were the subtests used for measuring selectivity. Furthermore, the first two tables of the colour-word-test [33] reflect a dimension of intensity (speed of information processing).Stimulus selection and reaction inhibition (“Go/NoGo”) were unimpaired at all times of measurement. Divided attention (missing items) showed no improvement after 6 months but after 12 months. Medians of reaction time in phasic and tonic alertness decreased significantly from baseline testing to the half-year follow-up, remaining stable until the one-year follow-up. So did the time for reading and naming colours (colour-word-test, NAI, tables I and II). The patient was not able to run through the vigilance test at all in the beginning. Six months later she had to quit after 15 minutes. After further six months, she reached an average level of performance.Working memory and monitoring were recorded by using memory tests (see above) and the colour-word-test, NAI [33], which is comparable to the Stroop-Test. Planning and problem solving were tested by the German version of the Tower of London (TL-D) [34] and verbal and figural fluency by the Regensburg word fluency test (RWT) [35] and, respectively, by a revised version of the Hamasch 5-point test (H5PT-R) [36]. Action flexibility was measured by a programmed motor task (three-step Luria test) [37]. Additionally verbal concept formation was examined by explaining proverbs and differences in word pairs (subtest of SIDAM, structured interview for diagnosing dementia) [38].Verbal concept formation, planning and problem solving, semantic and phonemic verbal fluency and shifting, and action flexibility were unimpaired throughout the time of record. Figural fluency improved significantly within the first 6 months, persisting on this level until the one-year follow-up. The same applied to the interference effect (reading time for incongruent stimuli, colour-word-test NAI, table III, table III-II).Constructional performance was measured by the Rey complex figure [29] and parallel versions (modified Taylor Complex Figure, MCG Complex Figure ) [30, 31]. The baseline showed no impairment, neither did the follow-ups.Confrontative Naming (Boston Naming Test) [39] was not affected at all. This outcome is in line with current literature as speech has been found to be one of the most resistant functions when it comes to cognitive impairments after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [40].Temporal orientation was completely regained at the first testing time.Quality of life was measured by a questionnaire concerning the state of health (SF-36) [41] and revealed no relevant impairments after six and twelve months.As mentioned before, patients suffering from neuropsychological sequelae show inhomogeneous patterns of cognitive impairments. Deficits in memory are reported in the majority of studies [9, 10, 12, 19, 42] and could be identified in this case as well. Both verbal and visual memory decreased. In particular verbal short-time and long-time retention as well as visual short-time memory have been effected. Studies revealing no other cognitive disturbances often used small test batteries, overemphasizing memory functions [15]. Hence, we applied a set of tests including different aspects of attention, executive functions, visuospatial performance, and language besides memory functions. Our patient underachieved in tonic and phasic alertness, divided attention, vigilance, naming colours, and figural fluency and under interfering conditions. Analogue to physical recovery and congruent to hitherto research of cognitive impairment a lot of functions showed a significant improvement after six months [19, 43, 44]. In contrast to these studies, significant advancements in the forward condition of the block-tapping test and in visual long-term retention and vigilance were observed after twelve months. Cognitive impairments did not influence quality of life during the whole observation period. Referring to Khot and Tirschwell [45] and Ørbo et al. [11], we suppose that there are some reasons for this favourable outcome. To begin with, the elapsed time until onset of bystander-initiated CPR has been extremely short. CPR prior to arrival of the ambulance is assumed to lead to better cognitive functioning [43, 44]. Second, the emergency response time was short. Third, ventricular fibrillation was treated with MTH, which is hypothesized to preserve global brain function and long-term functioning in cardiac arrest survivors [46–48]. Fourth, the patient had no other preexisting risk factors for cognitive problems [19]. Based on the assumption that brain damage has been restricted only to the selectively vulnerable brain regions, improvements beyond the first three months might have been explained with regard to Lim et al.’s (2004) findings. This study underlines the need for effective treatment in and out of hospital, with special emphasis on the need to increase knowledge of basic life support by public education to diminish the number of bystanders failing to come to action. Based on a neuropsychological perspective, this study emphasizes the necessity of cognitive assessments including different aspects of attention, memory, and executive functioning, as well as orientation and constructional performance of patients surviving even short cardiac arrests as a standard procedure to enable rehabilitation if deficits persist. The application of short screenings or, worse, the lack of neuropsychological investigations does not come up to the complexity of information processing. In our case the neurological examination, for example, only revealed problems of temporal orientation.Further investigations might reveal more details about the relationship between premorbid risk factors, extent of brain damage, medical treatment, and neuropsychological outcome.Written informed consent was obtained.The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
Cobalt Cardiomyopathy Secondary to Hip Arthroplasty: An Increasingly Prevalent Problem
1Department of Medicine, Mater Dei Hospital, Msida, Malta2Department of Cardiology, Mater Dei Hospital, Msida, MaltaCorrespondence should be addressed to Russel Tilney; moc.liamg@yenlit.lessurReceived 23 November 2016; Accepted 26 January 2017; Published 6 August 2017Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2017 Russel Tilney et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A forty-year-old man experienced worsening heart failure four years following bilateral complicated total hip replacement. His condition was extensively worked up but no underlying pathology was immediately evident. Given the cobalt-chromium alloy component present in the hip arthroplasties, the raised cobalt blood levels, and a fitting clinical picture coupled with radiological findings, the patient underwent right hip revision. Evidence of biotribocorrosion was present on direct visualisation intraoperatively. The patient subsequently experienced symptomatic improvement (NYHA class III to class I) and echocardiography showed recovery of ejection fraction. Cobalt exists as a bivalent and trivalent molecule in circulation and produces a cytotoxicity profile similar to nanoparticles, causing neurological, thyroid, and cardiological pathology. Blood levels are not entirely useful as there is no identifiable conversion factor for levels in whole blood, serum, and erythrocytes which seem to act independently of each other. Interestingly cobalt cardiomyopathy is frequently compounded by other possible causes of cardiomyopathy such as alcohol and a link has been postulated. Definitive treatment is revision of the arthroplasty as other treatments are unproven.Systemic cobalt toxicity has been linked to neurological, cardiological, and endocrinological pathology. As of January 2016 there are only 18 cases where cobalt toxicity has been attributed to cobalt-chromium alloys in hip arthroplasties; however causality has not been established. Approximately one million arthroplasties worldwide have been performed with cobalt components, mostly between 2003 and 2010.This case report discusses the possibility of metal-on-metal biotribocorrosion leading to severe cardiomyopathy with partial symptomatic and echocardiographic resolution on revision of the hip arthroplasty in a 40-year-old gentleman.A forty-year-old man presented with a two-month history of exertional dyspnoea and intermittent palpitations. The symptoms had worsened significantly in the few days preceding admission and he complained of orthopnoea and a persistent dry cough. He denied any antecedent infections but admitted to occasional cocaine and alcohol use. Examination at this time was unremarkable except for a persistent tachycardia of 126 beats per minute. Electrocardiography confirmed sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray showed an increased cardiothoracic ratio and a globular heart.His past history was significant for bilateral total hip replacement 4 years prior to presentation for a 2-year history of hip pain and inability to weight bear. Avascular necrosis was suspected. The procedure on the right was complicated by loosening of the acetabular cap which required reoperation one day postoperatively. The DePuy Corail® Total Hip System (cementless femoral stem without collar) was used bilaterally.A bedside echocardiogram during this admission revealed severely impaired left ventricular systolic function in the absence of gross dilatation. The left ventricle also appeared hypertrophied. In addition, a circumferential pericardial effusion of significant size was noted. Ejection fraction was estimated at 40–45% by Simpson’s biplane method on echocardiography.Pericardiocentesis was carried out: a total of 1.32 L of straw-coloured clear pericardial fluid was aspirated and sent for testing. Bacterial culture (including Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR) and cytology were negative. Biochemistry was compatible with a transudate.He underwent extensive workup for possible causes: EBV; CMV; HEP screen (HBsAg, HAV IgM, and anti-HCV antibody); Rickettsia conorii IgM, M. pneumoniae, ANA, total ENA, RF, ANCA, total IgM, IgA, and IgG, all tested negative.Following pericardiocentesis the cardiac contractility was observed to improve significantly on serial echocardiography; however ejection fraction did not improve. Speckling of the myocardium was, however, noted. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed which revealed no evidence of amyloid deposition on Congo red staining. Mild perivascular fibrosis around a few intramural vessels and mild vacuolation of a few cardiomyocytes was seen.A repeat bedside echocardiogram showed reaccumulation of the pericardial effusion and the patient was subsequently started on colchicine 500 micrograms BD. His antifailure treatment was optimized. The pericardial effusion continued to recur, so definitive management of the pericardial effusion with a pericardial window was performed.The patient was referred back to hospital from primary healthcare in view of a vague epigastric discomfort together with tachycardia. ECG confirmed new onset atrial flutter at 176 beats/min. He was anticoagulated with heparin and warfarin and urgent DC electrocardioversion was performed at 100 J under general anaesthetic, restoring sinus rhythm without any complications.On this occasion, echocardiography showed severely impaired biventricular function with an LVEF 20% using Simpson’s biplane method and advanced diastolic dysfunction with restrictive transmitral filling and raised filling pressure and a small localised pericardial effusion (inferolateral/inferior aspect of LV).Right and left heart studies showed normal coronary arteries. Cardiac output was estimated at 3.5 L/min by temperature haemodilution method.Given the past history of bilateral hip arthroplasty and persistent right-sided hip pain, the possibility of cardiomyopathy secondary to cobalt heavy metal poisoning due to a metal-on-metal (MoM) reaction from the hip prostheses was discussed. Whole blood cobalt levels were 4174 nmol/L (reference range < 5 nmol/L). The case was brought to the attention of the orthopaedic surgeon who performed the hip replacements and who confirmed that a cobalt-chromium alloy component was present (reference numbers provided below).Ultrasound imaging of the right hip demonstrated an inhomogenous, generally hypoechoic fluid collection with internal scattered echogenic debris measuring 8 cm × 3 cm  2.5 cm located between the skin and the right greater trochanter. The reporting radiologist suggested that this may represent an aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitic-associated lesion reaction.The left hip appeared largely unremarkable.The need for right hip revision was discussed with the patient who understood and agreed.Eight months later, revision of right total hip replacement was performed. Blackening of the gluteal muscle and greater trochanter secondary to metallosis was noted. The femoral stem was solid; however the head was dislocated. Thorough capsulotomy and synovectomy were performed. Postoperatively he was managed on ITU in view of his cardiomyopathy. Histology demonstrated reparative and inflammatory changes with metallosis.Five months later, he had a much better exercise tolerance (NYHA class III improved to class I) and estimated left ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiography improved to 45–50%.Cobalt is a trace metal element that is essential for the production of cobalamin permitting normal cellular function; however, in excess levels it may cause cellular damage: apoptosis, necrosis, and oxidative damage to DNA [1]. Cobalt toxicity first became evident following use of cobalt-chloride as a haematopoietic agent in anaemic individuals when it was noted to be goitrogenic [2, 3] and neurotoxic [3]. Low-output cardiomyopathy was identified in individuals who drank excessive amounts of “Brand XXX” beer in Quebec between 1962 and 1965; the beer was later found to have significantly higher levels of cobalt which was used as a foam-stabilising agent [4] and the term “Beer-drinker’s Cardiomyopathy” was coined.Over the last 15 years there has been an increase in the use of MoM total hip arthroplasties (THAs) and fears that soft tissue reactions may be on the increase have prompted the Medical and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to issue a medical device alert for these prostheses [5]. Monitoring of cobalt and chromium levels in these patients is now recommended [5].The process through which cobalt becomes available to interact with human physiology is termed biotribocorrosion (tribocorrosion within a biological environment). The tribological aspect describes the mechanical behaviour causing wear and tear, whilst corrosion refers to the electrochemical component of the process. Cobalt, once released into the systemic circulation, exists as a bivalent or trivalent nanoparticle and has a cytotoxicity profile similar to other nanoparticles (producing neuronal, cardiomyocyte, and thyroid damage through apoptosis, necrosis, and DNA damage) [1]. Numerous cobalt-containing nanoparticles have been identified through hip MoM simulations; however the exact biochemical mechanism through which they are produced remains unclear [6].For THAs, tribological damage typically occurs through wear and tear of two surfaces that are intended to articulate with each other, through third-body wear (such as particles within the joint space), and through non-weight-bearing surfaces [7] (such as micromotion at the modular components of prostheses) [8].Our patient presented with typical symptoms of cardiac cobalt toxicity, that is, dyspnoea and symptoms on exertion stemming from a low-output dilated cardiomyopathy (although our patient did not have significant dilatation). Atrial fibrillation and flutter and pericardial effusion have also been linked [1]. The pathophysiology is ill-defined but decreased oxygen uptake resulting in increased intracellular cardiomyocyte calcium levels and sympathetic tone has been suggested [9].Ultrasound of our patient’s hips (Figure 1) revealed a cystic mass associated with the right hip THA which is classically described as a “pseudotumour,” a noninfectious, nonneoplastic mass [10] which results from an ALVAL that produces a type IV hypersensitivity reaction [11]. The clinical features of this underrecognised condition are not specific but pain is typical. Findings suggestive of chronic inflammation related to ALVAL intraoperatively mandate revision of the articular surfaces. Dense perivascular inflammatory infiltrates are characteristic of ALVAL [11].Cobalt levels are not useful in defining toxicity and thresholds vary substantially from one study to the next [12]. In addition, levels may be measured from serum, whole blood, or erythrocytes [13] and there is no conversion factor for these values as the intracellular and extracellular compartments act independently of each other [14]. Cobalt and chromium levels, or cobalt levels alone, may be used to identify patients at risk of adverse reactions to metal debris [15].At this point a link between cobalt toxicity and systemic effects in the literature has not been shown. Furthermore, in this case report it is important to recognise that other causes may be present in this case. Both alcohol and cocaine may cause dilated cardiomyopathy [13, 16]. Alternative diagnoses must be considered especially since thyroid dysfunction and neurological deficits were absent. It is intriguing to note, however, that other cases were also confounded by alternative possible causes such as alcohol and it has been postulated that this may have compounded the clinical findings [17].Treatment with chelating agents has been attempted but has not been rigorously tested [18]. Addition of amino acids has also been tried in order to increase cellular transport of the chelators [18]. Haemodialysis is suspected to not have a profound effect on cobalt levels because it is primarily protein bound [19]. The definitive treatment for cobalt toxicity in the setting of implant related causes is therefore surgical removal of the implant [20].In conclusion, clinical vigilance is needed to diagnose and manage cobalt toxicity in patients who have undergone THAs in the past. At present the number of cases is small but, with the large number of MoM THAs that have been performed in the past, the likelihood is that we shall be seeing more of these cases in the near future.DePuy THA reference numbers used in our patient are as follows: left hip: acetabular implant, 9998-04-754; taper sleeve adaptor, 9998-00-108; femoral implant, 9998-90-147; femoral stem, 3L92514 Corail; right hip: acetabular implant, 9998-04-652; taper sleeve adaptor, 9998-00-102; femoral implant, 9998-90-146, femoral stem, 3L92513 Corail.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Surgery Averted Using a Novel, Minimally Invasive Approach to Treat Very Severe Radial Artery Spasm
Department of Medicine, Cardiology Division, Brooke Army Medical Center, Ft. Sam Houston, TX, USACorrespondence should be addressed to Anthony A. Cochet Jr.; lim.liam@lim.2tehcoc.a.ynohtnaReceived 28 March 2017; Accepted 9 July 2017; Published 2 August 2017Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2017 Anthony A. Cochet Jr. and Daniel A. Bellin. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 42-year-old male admitted with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction was referred for invasive angiographic assessment. Based on preprocedural assessment, the right radial artery approach was selected. Despite possessing none of the consensus risk factors for radial artery spasm, in addition to receiving standard arterial spasm prophylaxis and conscious sedation, the patient suffered very severe radial artery spasm with initial catheter placement, resulting in entrapment of a 5 Fr pigtail catheter within the left ventricle. After exhausting traditional methods for resolution of radial artery spasm, surgical intervention appeared to be the only remaining option for removal of the entrapped catheter. Prior to committing to surgery, use of an axillary nerve block to hinder sympathetic vascular tone was suggested and attempted. This intervention resulted in atraumatic catheter removal. We present a case of very severe radial artery spasm refractory to customary interventions, alleviated with a novel, minimally invasive technique, which spared surgical intervention. Transradial cardiac catheterization was first introduced as a plausible option for coronary angiography in 1989 by Campeau [1]. Successful percutaneous coronary intervention via radial artery access soon followed as reported by Kiemeneij et al. in 1995 [2]. Use of the transradial approach has become prevalent given its lower risk of bleeding and other vascular complications compared to the more traditional transfemoral approach [3]. Recent studies comparing the safety of radial versus femoral access for percutaneous intervention in ST elevation myocardial infarction have demonstrated a mortality benefit to radial access, decreased risk of major bleeding, and relative risk reduction in bleeding at the access site [4]. The most commonly reported complication in transradial catheterization is radial artery spasm [3]. This case presents a patient referred for invasive coronary angiography who suffered very severe radial artery spasm of the right radial artery, refractory to traditional interventions, requiring regional nerve block of the right axillary nerve for spasm resolution and catheter removal.The patient referred for invasive coronary angiography was a 42-year-old male, active duty US Army soldier, without significant cardiac history, admitted to Brooke Army Medical Center with chest pain. On the day of admission, the patient noted severe substernal chest pain along with lightheadedness, flushing, and nausea. Symptoms persisted for approximately 45 minutes and resolved spontaneously soon following presentation. Electrocardiogram obtained on arrival revealed diffuse ST segment depressions with an initial serum troponin T reported at 0.02 ng/mL. The patient was hemodynamically stable and free from chest pain at the time of admission. The patient was admitted to the Cardiology service for management of his NSTEMI, with plans to pursue an early invasive strategy. The patient was given aspirin 325 mg orally, clopidogrel 600 mg orally, and atorvastatin 80 mg orally and a continuous heparin infusion was initiated. Troponin T peaked at 0.42 ng/mL twelve hours following admission.The following morning, the patient was sent for left heart catheterization with coronary angiography with arterial access via the right radial artery. The patient was normotensive and in normal sinus rhythm on arrival to the catheterization laboratory. Midazolam 1 mg and fentanyl 25 mcg were administered intravenously, with appropriate conscious sedation achieved. After standard preparation of the site and subcutaneous infusion of 3 cc of 1% lidocaine, arterial access was obtained without difficulty via modified Seldinger technique and a hydrophilic Terumo 6 Fr Glidesheath Slender was advanced into the vessel followed by administration of intra-arterial verapamil 2.5 mg and nitroglycerin 400 mcg. Continuous intravenous heparin drip was also started prior to initiation of the procedure. A 5 Fr pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricle over a J-wire in the standard fashion for evaluation of LVEDP prior to ventriculography.Immediately following catheter placement, the patient experienced probable acute radial artery spasm, preventing either antegrade or retrograde movement of the catheter. Manipulation of the catheter was discontinued for 5–10 minutes to allow for spontaneous resolution of the spasm; however, catheter entrapment persisted. Additional conscious sedation with fentanyl 50 mcg and midazolam 1 mg was administered intravenously, warm compresses were applied, and supplemental intra-arterial infusions of nitroglycerin and verapamil were provided, again without resolution of catheter entrapment. Escalation of vasodilator therapy was then pursued with initiation of a nicardipine infusion at a rate of 12.5 mg/hour. After sufficient time was expended for medication effect to occur, attempt at catheter removal was again unsuccessful. Local subcutaneous administration of additional lidocaine and nitroglycerin was ineffective as well. Right femoral access was then obtained and the procedure resumed, revealing normal coronary angiography and left ventricular hemodynamics (Figure 1).With multiple traditional interventions for relief of radial spasm exhausted, consultation with anesthesiology was pursued to assist with escalation of sedation. The patient was converted by the anesthesia team to general sedation, first with propofol infusion followed by a dexmedetomidine infusion. Catheter entrapment nonetheless persisted. At this time, surgical consultation with vascular surgery and cardiothoracic surgery was obtained, as surgical intervention appeared a distinct possibility for catheter removal.A final attempt at nonsurgical intervention was collectively decided upon, with suggestion made to attempt regional axillary nerve block as a means of reducing sympathetic tone attributing to the severe vasoconstriction. Under ultrasound guidance, 40 cc of 1.5% mepivacaine without epinephrine was infused slowly in the location of the right axillary nerve. Right upper extremity venous engorgement and vasodilation were appreciated on ultrasound during infusion. Approximately seven minutes after completion of the infusion, gentle traction was placed on the radial catheter, resulting in atraumatic removal of both the sheath and catheter.The patient was monitored as an inpatient for 24 hours. He regained full function of his right arm without notable neurovascular deficiency. He has been followed up routinely as an outpatient without development of such deficiencies.This case demonstrates very severe radial artery spasm during diagnostic catheterization that exhausted the traditional methods utilized to both prevent and relieve radial artery spasm [5]. Although the transradial approach presents a safe alternative to the transfemoral approach in its reduced instances of major bleeding and other vascular complications, radial artery spasm remains a leading complication of the procedure [3]. Review of the literature reports instances of radial artery spasm of any severity as high as 14.7% to 24% [3, 6]. In a recent review, rates were much lower, at 5.6%, when studied in cases performed by experienced operators [5].Risk factors for development of radial artery spasm include female gender, large sheath size, multiple catheter exchanges and/or frequent catheter manipulation, anatomic variations of the radial artery, and operator inexperience [6]. A number of proposed methods have been evaluated in the prevention and treatment of radial artery spasm. However, radial artery spasm occurs at varying degrees of severity and no single intervention has proven successful in the resolution of all instances of this complication. The standard accepted method for prevention of spasm includes administration of intra-arterial vasodilators (nitroglycerin and verapamil being most common), use of hydrophilic sheaths, and local anesthesia [3, 6–8]. Conscious sedation and pain control appear to play a role in the prevention of radial artery spasm. However, no consensus yet exists on the routine implementation of preprocedural sedation in transradial catheterization to prevent this complication [8].Radial artery spasm is categorized based on the degree of pain, limitations of catheter movement, and interventions required to resolve the spasm. The degree of spasm is classified as mild, moderate, severe, or very severe (Table 1) [5]. Multiple proposed methods for resolution exist in the literature and in practice. Initial steps include warm compresses applied to the access site, repeat administration of intra-arterial vasodilators, subcutaneous analgesia/vasodilators, and allowing for adequate time without catheter manipulation for spasm resolution [3, 5, 6, 8]. Radial artery angiography has also been suggested for evaluation of the degree of spasm and overall vascular anatomy. Rarely in severe cases, where conservative therapy has failed to relieve the spasm, increased systemic analgesics and general anesthesia have been required to quell the spasm [8].The radial artery spasm discussed in this case represents a rare, severe form of the complication, in which established therapy was unsuccessful. In general, the patient lacked many of the traditional risk factors for radial artery spasm. Radial access was obtained quickly, without multiple punctures or difficulty with guidewire passage. A hydrophilic, slender sheath was utilized for radial cannulation. Catheter entrapment occurred immediately following passage of the initial diagnostic catheter, which required no significant manipulation for advancement into the left ventricle. The patient had received intravenous midazolam and fentanyl preprocedurally and he complained of no pain with access or catheter advancement, remaining consciously sedated throughout.Several unique circumstances existed which confounded the management of this complication. First, attempts at flushing or drawing from the sheath side port directly were unsuccessful and the pigtail catheter tip remained in the left ventricle. Therefore, radial artery angiography was unobtainable through either the sheath or the entrapped catheter, and infusion of spasmolytics through the sheath was prohibited. Second, given the location of the catheter tip within the left ventricle, surgical removal of the catheter may have required utilization of vascular and/or cardiothoracic surgeons. As general anesthesia failed to resolve the spasm, surgical intervention would have been the next intervention pursued had regional nerve block not been attempted.Although transradial catheterization continues to increase in prevalence worldwide, in the United States, it represents less than 10% of all invasive angiography [9] and less than 2% of percutaneous interventions [3]. As centers continue to increase the volume of transradial catheterizations performed, the prevalence of this complication will be encountered by angiographers with increasing frequency.We present a case of very severe radial artery spasm, refractory to traditional methods of resolution, in which surgical intervention for removal of an entrapped catheter was avoided with the use of a regional axillary nerve block—a novel technique that, to our knowledge, has not been published as a proven method to treat this complication. This case also demonstrates that significant radial artery spasm can occur even in a patient lacking many of the significant risk factors associated with this complication.The view(s) expressed herein are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the official policy or position of Brooke Army Medical Center, the 59th Medical Wing, the US Army Medical Department, the US Air Force Medical Service, the US Army Office of the Surgeon General, the US Air Force Office of the Surgeon General, the Department of the Army, the Department of the Air Force, the Department of Defense, or the US Government.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.All authors contributed equally to the preparation and final revisions of the case, as well as to the direct patient care.The authors would like to thank Dr. Brian Fitzgerald, staff anesthesiologist at Brooke Army Medical Center, Ft.

Case Report of First Angiography-Based On-Line FFR Assessment during Coronary Catheterization
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories, Cardiology Department, Rabin Medical Center, Belinson Hospital Affiliated to the “Sackler” Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Petah Tikva, IsraelCorrespondence should be addressed to Ran Kornowski; moc.liamg@ikswonrok.narReceived 24 April 2017; Revised 19 June 2017; Accepted 3 July 2017; Published 1 August 2017Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2017 Ran Kornowski and Hana Vaknin-Assa. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Fractional flow reserve (FFR), an index of the hemodynamic severity of coronary stenoses, is derived from hyperemic pressure measurements and requires a pressure-monitoring guide wire and hyperemic stimulus. Although it has become the standard of reference for decision-making regarding coronary revascularization, the procedure remains underutilized due to its invasive nature.  is a novel technology that uses the patient’s hemodynamic data and routine angiograms to generate a complete three-dimensional coronary tree, with color-coded display of the FFR values at each point along the vessels. After being proven to be as accurate as invasive FFR measurements in an off-line study, this case report presents the first on-line application of the system in the catheterization lab. Here too, a high concordance between  and invasive FFR was observed. In light of the demonstrated capabilities of the  system, it should emerge as an important tool for clinical decision-making regarding revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease.In patients with stable coronary disease, stenoses severity is assessed by pressure wire-based fractional flow reserve (FFR), a major and independent predictor of lesion-related coronary outcomes, which has become the standard of reference for decision-making regarding coronary revascularization. Yet, due to the invasive nature of the procedure FFR measurements remain underutilized [1, 2]. Therefore, the ability to derive FFR values from routinely performed coronary angiography, without the need for a pressure guide wire or drug-induced hyperemic stimulus, could have an important impact on daily clinical practice.Several image-based FFR techniques have been introduced in the past few years. Most are based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD), a method that uses numerical analysis and algorithms to calculate fluid flows within 3D structures. Their first validation tests were rather favorable but the computational complexity of CFD requires manual interaction, as well as a considerable processing time, which is problematic for “live” application in the catheterization lab. Additionally, the proposed tools usually allow for assessment of a specific lesion only within a chosen segment of the coronary artery [3–9].FFR-angiography ( developed by CathWorks, Ra’anana, Israel) is a novel technology providing a three-dimensional functional mapping of the coronaries. It is based on a rapid flow analysis of a dynamically derived lumped model which can assess FFR using routine angiograms. The accuracy of the  system was tested and validated in a recent publication [10].Following the acquisition of a normal angiogram, the user enters the mean aortic pressure. The coronary tree (right or left system) is reconstructed in 3D based on two or more conventional single-plane angiographic projections of the vessels, whereby epipolar ray tracing together with mathematical constraints enforcing the tree’s structure is utilized. Next, the system scans the entire reconstructed tree in 3D and analyzes each branch as well as each bifurcation, looking for narrowed regions. Hyperemic flow ratio is derived from automatic resistance-based lumped mapping along the entire coronary tree. The FFR values at each point along the vessel are color-coded and superimposed on the 3D epicardial model and cut-off values of 0.80 identical to standard invasive FFR apply.  does not utilize pharmacologic drug-induced hyperemia. This report describes the first “live” utilization of  during an actual catheterization procedure.A 74-year-old man was referred to our hospital for diagnostic angiography. His clinical history included unstable angina, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, past smoking, dyslipidemia, and mild renal insufficiency. The patient underwent coronary catheterization the previous year due to stable angina; multiple moderate lesions were detected in the Left Anterior Descending (LAD) and a conservative treatment strategy was then recommended.After 1 year, the patient was returned to the catheterization lab with NSTEMI. Diagnostic angiography revealed three consecutive discrete stenoses located in the proximal, middle, and distal segments of the LAD without evidence of diffuse disease (Figure 1(a)), and the patient was included as part of a 53-patient single-center study examining the accuracy of  when used on-line during the procedure. Based on visual estimation and the operator’s decision, invasive FFR was performed for the middle and distal lesions only. Invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements were 0.75 and 0.69, respectively (Figure 1(b)).The  algorithm was applied in parallel to the invasive measurements. A 3D quantitative coronary angiography analysis (QCA) was derived and yielded diameter stenoses of 49% and 44% for the middle and distal LAD lesions, respectively. The system created a 3D image of the coronary tree showing the calculated  values along the branches according to a color-coded scale. The calculated  values at the exact locations of the invasive measurements (e.g., using a pressure wire) were 0.78 and 0.62 for the middle and distal lesions, respectively. Figure 1(b) presents the 3D QCA analysis as well as the invasive FFR and corresponding computed values obtained by the  measurements for the middle and distal stenoses.Following stenting of the middle and distal LAD lesions, invasive FFR measurement at the distal LAD segment was 0.74. Image-based  values at the distal LAD were calculated once again by using the posttreatment angiography, yielding a value of 0.71, and compared to the invasive FFR value (Figure 2). As both FFR values remained significant (<0.8) after stenting the middle and distal stenoses, the proximal LAD lesion was stented as well.The  system that was utilized in our case is a novel image-based technology that enables an image-based assessment of FFR, calculated from common angiograms reconstructed in 3D along with routinely measured hemodynamic data. Importantly, the  system, which is not based on CFD, was designed to keep the pace of the catheterization procedure; that is, the time from image acquisition to display of the  results is <10 min in most cases and the entire procedure requires minimal input from the operator.In the case presented herein, the  system detected the two lesions seen in the 2D angiography which were evaluated with invasive FFR and successfully performed a lesion-per-lesion evaluation of the coronary physiology, without necessitating fragmentation of the measurements. Thus, the impact of the stenoses on the coronary tree was fully presented to the operator as a physiological roadmap. With the fact that the  system is considered an investigational device, only the invasive FFR was used to guide treatment.While other groups have attempted to use angiographic data to simulate invasive FFR measurements, [3–6, 8, 9, 11, 12], the methods are laborious, require additional analysis, and often involve long processing times which are limited to off-line analysis by a core laboratory. Of special interest is the quantitative flow ratio (QFR) method. Tu et al. used the QFR method derived from 3 different flow models (QAngio XA 3D prototype and Medis, Leiden, Netherlands) based on 3D QCA of vessel segments and the flow moving through the stenosis [8]. This system relies on 3D QCA combined with additional TIMI frame count from high-quality images (30 frames/second) for the calculation of mean volumetric flow rate at hyperemia and still requires induced hyperemic conditions. This method also provides assessment of the main vessel of interest without providing the side branches.In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time a coronary case utilizing “on-line”  technology, showing good concordance with the wire-based FFR in sequential lesions of the LAD both before and after stenting. The system allowed for comprehensive functional evaluation of the vessel without the need for drug-induced hyperemia and/or fragmentation of the measurements, as required using conventional invasive FFR. Once confirmed in larger studies and on a wide spectrum of coronary lesions,  should emerge as an important tool for physiologic assessment of coronary artery disease.Professor Ran Kornowski is a cofounder and an equity shareholder in CathWorks Ltd.This study was funded by CathWorks Ltd.
Incomplete Resolution of Deep Vein Thromboses during Rivaroxaban Therapy

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We present the case of a patient with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who failed rivaroxaban therapy. Our patient initially presented with left lower extremity edema, erythema, and pain. He was subsequently started on rivaroxaban therapy for a combined treatment period of 12 months, during and after which he persisted to have evidence of a DVT. The patient’s prescribed drug regimen was changed from rivaroxaban to warfarin, which demonstrated a rapid resolution of the DVTs as determined by ultrasound assessment of our patient’s lower extremity veins. Rivaroxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, is a well-known oral anticoagulant that is used for a variety of indications and has become a mainstay in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. With the introduction and emergence of this medication in the clinic, postmarketing reports of efficacy or lack thereof are important to review. In conclusion, we anticipate that it is likely that there are other patients with DVTs who may not respond to rivaroxaban and for whom alternative anticoagulation therapies should be explored.Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) is a novel oral anticoagulant that inhibits platelet activation and fibrin clot formation via direct, selective, and reversible inhibition of factor Xa in both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways. Factor Xa, as part of the prothrombinase complex consisting also of factor Va, calcium ions, factor II, and phospholipid, catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin both activates platelets and catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. At this time, factor Xa inhibitors are emerging as a popular alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or warfarin therapy because factor Xa inhibitors do not require international normalized ratio (INR) testing nor specific dietary restrictions. The indications for rivaroxaban therapy include reduction in the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE), reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and of PE after a 6-month trial for the treatment for DVT and/or PE, or prophylaxis of DVT (which may lead to PE in patients undergoing knee replacement or hip replacement surgery) [1]. Major contraindications include active pathological bleeding and severe hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis [1]. Rivaroxaban is currently widely recommended as a mainstay treatment for DVT [2]. A minimum of three months of anticoagulation with medications such as rivaroxaban are recommended in those with unprovoked DVT or recurrent DVT or provoked with minor risk factors for DVT [2]. If treatment is successful and the thrombus resolves, some patients may still require indefinite treatment [2]. Unfortunately, when factor Xa inhibitors fail, the alternatives in an outpatient setting are to change therapy to low molecular weight heparin and/or warfarin therapies [2]. Indeed, the standard for both prevention and treatment for over 60 years has been vitamin k antagonists like warfarin (Coumadin®, Jantoven®, and Marevan®), phenprocoumon, and acenocoumarol; however, VKA therapy is inconvenient due in part to its increased risk of adverse events such as bleeding, dietary restrictions, and the need for regular blood monitoring, thereby making it a less desirable option [2].In addition to not requiring dietary restrictions nor frequent INR evaluations, rivaroxaban has other advantages such as rapid absorption and almost 100% bioavailability when taken with food (at specific doses) [3] and has been shown, in some studies, to be noninferior to enoxaparin/VKA—the current standard of care for venous thromboembolism [4]. On the other hand, rivaroxaban’s disadvantages have been documented as well. The major disadvantages include internal bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding [5], as well as documented cases in which thromboembolisms do not completely resolve [6, 7].The patient in this case report is a 65-year-old white male, with a past medical history significant for mild depression and subclinical hypothyroidism, who presented in 2015 with a primary complaint of 3 days of left lower extremity pain, erythema, and edema. At the time of the visit, he also complained of dizziness of 2-day duration which was not related to changes of position. The severity of this symptom was mild to moderate, and no other associated symptoms were noted. He reported being very sedentary and experienced some tingling of the right foot. The patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or syncope. He did not monitor his blood pressure at home, nor did he follow any exercise or diet programs. He has no known drug allergies, and his drug regimen at initial presentation included escitalopram 20 milligrams every other day for mild depression (which was being tapered off), as well as fiber supplements and daily multivitamins. Overall, the patient was noted to have multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease including male gender, age, sedentary lifestyle, stress, and tobacco use.On physical examination, the patient was reported as a well-developed, well-nourished male with a BMI of 23.1 and body weight of 79.4 kilograms. The patient’s neck was supple with no jugular venous distention. A left carotid bruit was audible, carotid pulses were +2/2, and there was a normal carotid artery upstroke bilaterally. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or rhonchi. His cardiovascular exam revealed a regular heart rate and rhythm. His cardiac point of maximal impulse was at the left fifth intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. Normal cardiac S1 and S2 sounds were noted with physiologic splitting of S2. No murmurs, thrills, rubs, gallops, or clicks were appreciated. Pulses in the extremities were 2+ throughout bilaterally at the time of presentation, and no cyanosis or clubbing was noted. Mild varicose veins in the distal lower extremities bilaterally were noted. Evidence of left lower extremity pain, erythema, and edema were noted. An abridged mental status exam revealed a cooperative patient well oriented to time, place, and person, without evidence of psychotic features. The patient’s recall was within normal limits.Given these findings, the patient underwent an ultrasound study that confirmed a left femoral vein thrombus, and he was started on rivaroxaban therapy. In accord with current recommendations for rivaroxaban therapy, the patient was started on rivaroxaban at 15 milligrams PO twice daily for 3 weeks and then continued at 20 milligrams PO daily for 6 months. Upon initiation of rivaroxaban, aspirin 81 milligrams PO daily was added to his regimen. DVT presence was monitored, and rivaroxaban therapy was eventually discontinued after a total of one year (per protocol [2]) and aspirin was continued for an additional 2 months. When serial follow-up ultrasounds continued to show persistent thrombi in the femoral and popliteal veins, he was then restarted on rivaroxaban therapy for another 2 months at 20 mg daily. After this second challenge with rivaroxaban, a repeat ultrasound again showed a persistent DVT. The patient was then bridged to warfarin therapy, continuing rivaroxaban at 20 mg daily and adding warfarin 5 mg daily with an INR goal of 2.0–3.0. Thereafter, his INR goals were met by adjusting his warfarin dose weekly. After 5 days of bridging, rivaroxaban was discontinued.The patient was maintained on warfarin 7.5 milligrams alternating with 5 milligrams on alternate days PO (dosing varies by week per INR) in addition to escitalopram, fiber supplementation, and multivitamins, as mentioned earlier. This regimen was well tolerated by the patient and without complication.In review, after initiation of rivaroxaban therapy, the patient continued to be symptomatic; therefore, we continued to monitor his DVTs to assess his progression. A Siemens ACUSON Cypress ultrasound system was used to perform ultrasonography of his lower extremity which revealed thrombus in his left mid-superficial femoral vein (SFV). The ultrasound assessments began six days after initiation of rivaroxaban therapy (Figures 1(a)–1(d)) and then again at 9 months. Then, after one year of rivaroxaban and aspirin treatment, followed by 2 months of aspirin therapy alone, another ultrasound was performed which continued to demonstrate thrombus presence. Finally, after bridging to warfarin therapy, another ultrasound was performed which demonstrated vast improvements (see Figures 2(a)–2(e)).Figures 1(a)–1(d) demonstrated our initial/baseline ultrasound findings which correspond to six days following initiation of rivaroxaban therapy. The right mid-SFV appeared patent without compression (Figure 1(a)) and fully collapsed upon compression (Figure 1(b)), indicating no presence of thrombi. The left SFV measured 8.3 millimeters, before compression with the ultrasound transducer (Figure 1(c)), and manual compression of the vessel measured 8.2 millimeters (Figure 1(d)), indicating the presence of a thrombus.Over a period of approximately one year of treatment with rivaroxaban, the ultrasound measurements demonstrated a general downward trend in the size of the thrombi which were followed over approximately one year of treatment with rivaroxaban, but a complete resolution in half of the vessels followed was not detected. The left common femoral vein (CFV) DVT resolved at the 9th-month mark (Figure 2(a)), and the left proximal SFV thrombosis resolved at the one-year mark (Figure 2(b)). The more distal thrombi (left mid-SFV and distal SFV) waxed and waned, but these were generally stable at the one-year assessment. When the patient was switched to warfarin treatment, there was an approximately 13% improvement in the left distal SFV and a 20% improvement of the left mid-SFV in a period of just 16 days (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). The most drastic change in percent occlusion was of the left popliteal vein, which underwent a rapid and complete resolution of the thrombosis within 16 days of warfarin treatment after a slow but steady decline in the size of the thrombus with rivaroxaban therapy alone (Figure 2(e)).This case is of interest because a widely used and approved pharmacologic treatment of DVT did not perform as expected in this patient. A thorough literature review revealed little in the way of reports of rivaroxaban failure in the treatment of DVT, although a few case reports in which potential rivaroxaban failure is noted have emerged recently [6, 7]. Postmarketing surveillance is clearly an important factor in the further development, safety, and efficacy of any novel drug. Since the initial FDA approval of rivaroxaban in July 2011, this drug has been indicated for many uses and is widely recommended in current clinical practice [8].Heparin and vitamin K antagonist have at times been shown to fail in the treatment of thrombi [9–11]. The recent addition of factor Xa inhibitors to anticoagulant agents is not without fault (i.e., failure, bleeding, and lack of reversal agents), as demonstrated in this case report and other papers [6, 7, 12]. The risk factors for failure of anticoagulation therapy are vast and vary from patient to patient; pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and elimination all have a hand in how a drug interacts in a given patient and are further discussed below [13–15]. The patient discussed in our case does not seem to have any of these risk factors as noted from his normal liver function tests and creatinine clearance.Another lab value of interest is the D-dimer level. The patient’s D-dimer value was elevated to 4160 ng/ml fibrinogen equivalent units or FEU (normal is less than 500 ng/ml FEU) upon initiation of rivaroxaban treatment. The D-dimer level was noted to decrease over time with rivaroxaban alone; however, the value never normalized (even after more than one year of treatment). Over approximately 5 months of warfarin therapy alone, the D-Dimer values steadily normalized (190 ng/ml FEU).Although factor Xa inhibitors are quite popular, there are cases emerging of its rare adverse effects (i.e., exsanguination), especially in patients with hypertension, heart failure, coronary heart disease, and impaired renal and/or hepatic function and those with certain types of cancers [16]. Animal models are exposing other mechanisms that affect the efficacy of rivaroxaban; in one mouse model, rivaroxaban’s anticoagulant effect was augmented by angiotensin II [17].The pathophysiology for the potential failure of rivaroxaban therapy in the treatment of DVT is poorly understood. However, drug metabolism may play a significant role. The physiologic metabolism of rivaroxaban is severalfold, including oxidative degradation of the morpholinone moiety as the major pathway and hydrolysis of the central amide bond and of the lactam amide bond in the morpholinone ring as the minor pathways, all of which occur within hepatocytes and liver microsomes [13]. Any change in the metabolism of any of these pathways would lead to a change in the efficacy of the drug itself. Furthermore, the main metabolite of rivaroxaban is excreted both renally and fecally via the biliary system, and malfunctioning of these pathways could also lead to a change in the efficacy of rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban is also well known to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 and binds to P-glycoprotein, hence leading to risks of pharmacokinetic interactions that may alter its anticoagulant properties [14]. Furthermore, it is notable that rivaroxaban has a terminal half-life of only 5–9 hours, yet it is generally recommended to be taken at 20 mg PO once a day after an initial dosing period at 15 mg PO twice daily. In view of such relatively rapid elimination, high, early peaks of rivaroxaban could increase the risk of bleeding and low troughs could result in suboptimal anticoagulation. It will be important to determine if a better rivaroxaban dosing regimen is required to address its unique pharmacokinetic profile [15]. One study suggests a method that measures rivaroxaban’s activity level in individual patients, which can be used to compare clinical variable and patient outcomes, leading to a more customizable treatment plan and dosing regimen [18].With regard to this case report on thrombus resolution after warfarin therapy, further work-up is warranted to discover the lack of the expected response to primary rivaroxaban treatment; these diagnostics may include a thrombophilia panel and rivaroxaban serum levels to determine genetic risk factors and compliance, respectively. The patient did not present with any apparent hepatic or renal insufficiency based on normal liver function tests and creatinine levels on initial examination, as mentioned previously. Renal function has been shown to have a hand in the dosing of factor Xa inhibitors [19]. Factors that may be affecting this drug’s efficacy could be lack of proper compliance, various hypercoagulable states, or certain mutations that can cause undesirable metabolism of rivaroxaban [20]. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been known to cause platelet aggregation/hypercoagulable states and potentially lead to thrombus formation and even cause pulmonary embolism [21].Because of the threat of a pulmonary embolism from a DVT, it is important to have considered other factors/features that may be related to thrombi. A negative D-dimer lab value can help exclude the possibility of a PE [22]; in the case of our patient, initially, his D-dimer value was elevated, as noted above, and normalized after some time with warfarin therapy alone; this was not unexpected, as the protective effects of warfarin in the case of DVT/pulmonary embolism have been well documented [23].Another feature of DVTs to consider is whether the thrombi noted in our patient are persistent or recurrent. Due to the location, initial size, and downtrending progression of the thrombi, we strongly believe that our patient had persistent thrombi. Assessing for persistent versus recurrent thrombi would be quite difficult as a thrombus can form in as little as 4 hours [24].Although extremes of body weight (<50 kg or >120 kg) are not reported to significantly influence rivaroxaban’s effects, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) 2016 guideline suggests avoiding the use of rivaroxaban (and other direct oral anticoagulants) in patients with a BMI  kg/m2 or body weight  kg due to the lack of clinical data in this population (ISTH) [25].In clinical practice, it may be best to choose between available anticoagulant drugs on a case-by-case basis [26]. It will be important to take into account patient preferences, monitoring constraints and difficulty controlling the INR, the risk of bleeding, drug interactions, and the cost of treatment [27]. In light of this case report, we acknowledge novel oral anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban, to be an important contribution to many formularies as they have been beneficial to the vast majority of patients who require anticoagulation; this case report is merely intended to highlight a noted anomaly to be taken into consideration for future practice.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Incidental Finding of an Undiagnosed Coarctation of the Aorta Causing Dilated Cardiomyopathy in an Adult

Two weeks following admission he complained of left arm pain and CT upper limb confirmed embolic occlusion of the left brachial artery and incidental severe coarctation of the proximal descending aorta after the origin of the left subclavian artery. Follow-up TTE suggested the presence of coarctation of the aorta on a suprasternal view which was not performed at the time of his first TTE. His heart failure and blood pressure responded very well to medical therapy and he has been referred for surgical correction of his aortic coarctation.We present an extremely rare case of dilated cardiomyopathy as a presentation of aortic coarctation in an adult patient.31-year-old male presented with dyspnoea on exertion NYHA class II, orthopnoea, and lower limb oedema for three weeks. These symptoms were preceded by flu-like symptoms. He was also noted to be hypertensive by his GP a week prior to admission and was started on Ramipril. He has no other significant past medical history apart from a high Body Mass Index of 38. He consumed about 40 units of alcohol per week and he has a positive family history of ischaemic heart disease (father and two grandfathers had myocardial infarction at the age of 50). Examination revealed a blood pressure of 160/70 mmHg, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on room air, raised jugular venous pressure, bibasal crepitation, lower limb oedema, and no cardiac murmurs. Radiofemoral delay was not checked during initial assessment but was detected following the result of the CT scan. Initial investigations included an electrocardiography which showed sinus tachycardia with left ventricular hypertrophy. High sensitivity troponin-T was elevated at 55 ng/L (upper limit 14 ng/L), with no rise on serial testing. Chest X-ray revealed marked cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio of 0.68 and pulmonary congestion but there was no rib notching. TTE confirmed a severely dilated left ventricle (left ventricular internal dimension-diastole of 6.9 cm) with severe global systolic dysfunction, moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, bicuspid aortic valve without significant gradient, and an estimated ejection fraction of 25–30%. Two weeks following admission he complained of sudden onset severe left arm pain and CT left upper limb confirmed embolic occlusion of the left brachial artery at the level of the distal third of the humerus and incidental coarctation of the aorta at the isthmus (Figure 1). The coarctation measures approximately 0.5–0.6 cm, compared with 2.0 cm in the distal arch and 2.7 cm in the proximal descending aorta. Follow-up TTE suggested the presence of coarctation of the aorta on a suprasternal view which was not performed at the time of his first TTE (Figure 2). The patient was then treated with intravenous diuretics along with other usual heart failure measures. The patient’s heart failure responded very well to treatment. He lost 20 kilograms with diuretics and his blood pressure was adequately controlled. He also had successful embolectomy of his left brachial artery and was put on intravenous heparin and then had oral anticoagulation with warfarin. He is on regular follow-up in the cardiology clinic and is awaiting surgical intervention for his aortic coarctation.In this report, we presented a case of aortic coarctation that remained undiagnosed until the development of congestive cardiac failure in adulthood. Most cases of aortic coarctation are diagnosed in childhood due to the development of congestive cardiac failure or during adulthood due to treatment-refractory hypertension.Dilated cardiomyopathy is a rare clinical presentation of coarctation of aorta in infants [1, 2]. One such case of dilated cardiomyopathy was reported by Aǧaç et al. in 2012. The patient was a 55-year-old man who presented with symptoms of recent-onset cardiac failure [3]. The patient was successfully managed with stent implantation. Our patient, although stabilized at present, is still awaiting surgical intervention for correction of the coarctation at the time of preparation of the manuscript. More recently, another case of dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to aortic coarctation was reported; however, this patient had coarctation at an atypical location, namely, the aortic arch [4]. Our patient had the coarctation at the isthmus.With regard to other symptoms at presentation, our patient also had newly diagnosed hypertension. However, during the initial evaluation his cardiac failure was attributed to the history of excessive alcohol consumption or possible myocarditis.Taken together, our experience in this case highlights the need for the thorough evaluation of patients with heart failure and hypertension to rule out various causes of heart failure, including cardiomyopathy secondary to aortic coarctation. In conclusion, we presented an extremely rare case of dilated cardiomyopathy as a presentation of aortic coarctation in an adult patient. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be only the third such case report in English literature.The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.
“Spice” (Synthetic Marijuana) Induced Acute Myocardial Infarction: A Case Series

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Marijuana is the most widely abused “recreational” substance in the United States, with highest prevalence in young adults. It is reported to cause ischemic strokes, hepatitis, anxiety, and psychosis. Although it is associated with dose dependent tachycardia and can lead to coronary vasospasm, it has not been directly related to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Marijuana induced coronary vasospasm can result in endothelial denudation at the site of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque in response to hemodynamic stressors, potentially causing an AMI. Spice refers to herbal mixture with composition and effects similar to that of marijuana and therefore is referred to as “synthetic marijuana.” Herein, we report 3 cases of spice induced ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. All patients were relatively young and had few or absolutely no risk factors for cardiovascular disease. All patients underwent emergent coronary angiography, with two needing stent placement and the third requiring only aspiration thrombectomy. Our case series emphasizes the importance of suspecting and investigating synthetic marijuana use in low risk young adults presenting with AMI.A 31-year-old African American male, with no past cardiovascular history presented to the emergency room (ER) with sharp left sided chest pain radiating down the left arm. The pain started 30–40 minutes after he smoked spice (synthetic marijuana). On physical examination, he had an elevated blood pressure of 163/89 mmHg and the electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed anterolateral ST elevations consistent with STEMI (Figure 1). The patient underwent an emergent left heart catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed normal left main coronary artery, subtotally occluded mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) with an extensive clot burden and TIMI-I flow distally. The right coronary and left circumflex arteries were widely patent. Patient had successful aspiration thrombectomy using AngioJet, followed by a bare metal stent deployment in the mid LAD. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate anteroseptal hypokinesis with mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction and ejection fraction of 45–50%.His hospital stay was uneventful and he was discharged three days later on the following medications: aspirin 81 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg at bed time, and metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily. Since the patient had no risk factors for coronary artery disease, we suspected that his STEMI could be related to plaque instability caused by smoking spice.A 26-year-old Caucasian male, with past medical history of hypertension, presented to the hospital with a 2 hours’ history of retrosternal nonradiating pain at rest. The patient admitted to smoking spice a few hours prior to the onset of symptoms. As the EKG showed lateral ST elevations, the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory immediately (Figure 2). Coronary angiography showed normal left main coronary artery and an angiographically normal left circumflex as well as a normal right coronary artery.A large thrombus burden was present in the proximal LAD involving the origin of first diagonal (D1) branch. The patient underwent manual aspiration thrombectomy with restoration of TIMI III flow. There was no significant vessel stenosis after thrombectomy, so no stent was deployed. Left ventriculography showed EF of 60 percent with anterior wall hypokinesis. STEMI protocol was followed and patient was observed in the hospital for a few days. His discharge medications included aspirin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, and lisinopril 20 mg daily. The patient was asymptomatic at 4 weeks’ follow-up.The extensive clot burden in LAD and D1 in the absence of risk factors for CAD was suggestive of spice induced coronary thrombosis.A 47-year-old African American male with past medical history of hypertension presented to the hospital with 3 hours of crushing substernal pain. He had no relief of his pain using acetaminophen and subsequently decided to seek medical attention. His EKG showed extensive ST-segment elevation involving inferior and anterolateral leads (Figure 3). Emergent left heart catheterization revealed normal left main coronary artery, complete thrombotic occlusion of the distal LAD, 40 percent stenosis of mid RCA, and a normal left circumflex artery. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed apical hypokinesis with LVEF of 40–45%. The patient admitted to smoking marijuana and spice 6 hours before presentation to the hospital. A drug eluting stent was deployed to distal LAD following aspiration thrombectomy. The discharge medications included aspirin 81 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg at bedtime, carvedilol 25 mg twice a day, and fosinopril 10 mg daily. The patient followed up in the Cardiology Clinic 2 weeks after discharge and was asymptomatic.Although marijuana has some therapeutic indications, it is mainly used as a recreational drug by young adults. Despite emerging data about possible health benefits of marijuana, it still has many adverse effects [1, 2]. Spice, which is chemically similar to marijuana, is being marketed as a safe alternative to it despite sharing many of the adverse effects of marijuana.Marijuana is known to contain at least 60 chemical products, but the main biological effects of marijuana result from delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoids, with cannabinoid JWH-018 being the active ingredient [3]. Effects of cannabinoids are mediated through the activation of cannabinoid receptors in brain, immune system, spleen, blood vessels, and heart. Smoking marijuana also exposes the individual to particulates and gaseous material arising from the combustion of plant products. Smoking marijuana is associated with a dose dependent increase in heart rate and supine blood pressure. It can also cause postural hypotension. Tolerance to hemodynamic effects of marijuana may occur with repeated use [4]. Marijuana has been widely reported to cause ischemic strokes, hepatitis, anxiety, and psychosis.A summary of adverse effects of marijuana is shown below.(1)Anxiety and panic, especially in naïve users.(2)Impaired attention, memory, and psychomotor performance while under the influence.(3)Increased risk of accident driving while intoxicated with cannabis, especially in conjunction with alcohol.(4)Increased risk of acute psychotic symptoms leading to self-mutilation [5].(5)A “cannabis dependence syndrome” characterized by an inability to abstain from or to control cannabis use [6].(6)Increased risk of cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus, as well as leukemia among offspring exposed in utero [7].(7)Impaired educational attainment in adolescents and underachievement in adults who work in jobs requiring high-level cognitive skills.(8)Adolescents with a history of poor school performance, who initiate cannabis use in the early teens, are at increased risk of using other illicit drugs and of becoming dependent on cannabis.(9)Women who continue to smoke cannabis during pregnancy may increase their risk of having a low-birth weight baby [8].The adverse consequences of cannabis use may diminish or disappear with sustained abstinence or reduction in use. Smoking marijuana is also associated with a fivefold increase in carboxyhemoglobin concentration and a threefold higher concentration of Tar [1] when compared to smoking tobacco which results in a decreased oxygen carrying capacity and increased factor VII activity [9]. Synthetic cannabinoids appear to be 4 to 5 times more potent and appear to have more pronounced and severe cardiovascular effects than traditional marijuana [10]. Marijuana exerts its action on cardiovascular system by stimulating sympathetic nervous system. Oxygen requirement of the myocardium increases because of tachycardia induced by sympathetic nervous system. These mechanisms can potentially result in a lower angina threshold in patients with chronic atherosclerotic narrowing. Although there is a lot of interindividual variability, typical increases in heart rate with a single marijuana cigarette range from 20% to 100%, with the peak in heart rate occurring 10 to 30 minutes after starting smoking [2]. THC can also enhance atrioventricular node conduction and decrease peripheral vascular resistance. These effects have been linked to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in some cases [11].Another proposed mechanism of myocardial infarction after using marijuana is the disruption of atherosclerotic plaque in response to hemodynamic stresses. Some experts have proposed endothelial denudation and platelet activation, due to coronary artery spasm and hemodynamic stress, at the site of a vulnerable plaque as the possible mechanism [2, 12]. The vasoactive and hemostatic factors released by platelets at the site of plaque rupture cause occlusive thrombus formation, resulting in acute myocardial infarction. In vitro studies have shown that cannabis may have procoagulant effects, through increased expression of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa and P-selectin on platelets [13]. Some authors have postulated an inhibitory effect of large THC concentrations on agonist-induced platelet aggregation. Others have reported elevated aggregation of platelets in the presence of THC. Whether the direct or indirect hemodynamic effects of marijuana are sufficient to cause plaque disruption is speculative, as there are no direct studies of this phenomenon available in the literature [2].Our case series has some important health care implications. Though spice produces effects similar to cannabis, it is sometimes more potent despite it being marketed as a safe alternative to cannabis [3, 8, 14, 15]. Easy access and the misconception that spice products are natural and harmless have contributed to their popularity. Another selling point is that the chemicals used in making spice can not be detected by the usual toxicology screens. People who use spice frequently can experience withdrawal and addiction symptoms. In addition to causing various cardiovascular effects, spice can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, hallucinations, extreme anxiety, and paranoid behavior [16–19].In conclusion, our case series stresses upon the importance of suspecting and inquiring about drug abuse, especially spice abuse, in low risk young adults presenting with myocardial infarction.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Recurrent Wheezing and Cough Caused by Double Aortic Arch, Not Asthma

Double aortic arch is a congenital vascular abnormality in which the connected segments and their branches course between and compress the trachea and esophagus, often resulting in invariable airway compression. Case Presentation. A 4-year-old boy with a history of recurrent wheezing was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of asthma based on his past medical history, persistent cough, wheezing, and airway hyperresponsiveness by lung function test. Double aortic arch was diagnosed with computed tomography angiogram. After surgery, the respiratory infection improved strikingly. Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent chronic, irreversible complications. Conclusion. We present a case of double aortic arch masquerading as asthma.Congenital abnormalities of the aortic arch and its major branches result in the formation of vascular rings around the trachea and esophagus with varying degrees of compression [1]. One of the most common anomalies is double aortic arch. In this type of vascular ring, the ascending aorta bifurcates and forms a right and left sided arch [2]. As the most common congenital anomaly of the aortic arch system, the connected segments and their branches course between and compress the trachea and esophagus [3–7]. Symptoms are frequently present during childhood. Affected children may have cough, stridor, dyspnea, and upper respiratory tract infections. It can be diagnosed with the aid of echocardiography, axial computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging [8–12]. Bronchoscopy may be helpful in more severe cases to determine the extent of airway narrowing. As for the treatment, surgery is advised for symptomatic patients who have evidence of tracheal compression [1].Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways resulting in episodic airflow obstruction. Intermittent dry coughing and expiratory wheezing are the most common chronic symptoms of asthma. The diagnosis of asthma in children requires a careful review of their past medical history, family history, a physical examination, and lung function test [13].The diagnosis of double aortic arch is typically made because of the symptoms caused by tracheal and/or esophageal compression. Children always present with cough, biphasic stridor, wheezing, recurrent respiratory infections, and dysphagia [14]. The diagnosis of asthma is often based largely on clinical symptoms: hyperresponsiveness and reversibility of airflow obstruction. Therefore, the diagnosis of asthma is very often based on a clinical history and a patient’s response to a medication [15], that is, the point in the differential diagnosis between these two diseases.This is a case report of a patient with double aortic arch that had been misdiagnosed as asthma.A 4-year-old boy with a history of recurrent wheezing was admitted to the inpatient department of our hospital for evaluation of acute exacerbation of severe asthma. On admission, the patient complained of recurrent wheezing and intermittent cough, with shortness of breath, general fatigue, orthopnea, being pale, and sweating. All his symptoms can worsen at night. The child’s parents denied any foreign body aspiration, weight loss, and trauma. Physical examination revealed tachypnea, cyanosis, suprasternal retraction, and a prolonged expiratory crackles at lungs. His saturation level of oxygen in hemoglobin was 91% with an oxygen supplemental therapy. In laboratory tests, both his skin prick test and serum dosage of IgE were negative, and his lung function test showed airway hyperresponsiveness, in which his V75 and V50 were in mild reduction, PF was in moderate reduction, and the bronchial dilation was negative.The child has a history of recurrent respiratory infection (4 times), which is characterized by cough, fever, and wheeze. One was at the age of 10 months and three were all after 3 years. He was diagnosed as asthma because of a history of recurrent wheezing episodes and airway hyperresponsiveness suggested by lung function test. But his skin prick test and serum dosage of IgE did not support this diagnosis. However, the patient did not do regular follow-up. During the age of 10 months to 3 years, there was no wheezing. His wheezing could partially be improved by bronchodilator and systemic corticosteroid. Each episode of wheezing had lasted more than 20 days when the patient was treated in outpatient department. It seemed that the patient is not so sensitive to the steroid treatment.Considering the patient’s history, this was his fourth asthmatic attack, but this time when he was referred to the inpatient department, he was not relieved of the symptoms by routine treatment. Should we need to consider other diseases rather than asthma? After admission, we did the bronchoscopy to examine his airway. The bronchoscopy revealed tracheal narrowing at the lower end of the trachea without any internal pathology. The normal CT scan of lung showed no parenchymal disease. Then we advised the patient to do an enhanced computed tomography angiogram to get more information about the airway and the vessel. Considering some other social factors and radiation, the parents refused to do so. After 8 days of treatment the patient’s parents asked for discharging from the hospital.When we did follow-up two weeks later, the patient’s parents finally agreed to do an enhanced computed tomography angiogram on the lung. The diagnosis of DAA was confirmed. CT angiogram revealed a vascular ring, consisting of a double aortic arch, around the trachea, and the right side was dominant which was compressing the trachea. The medical images of this patient are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The echocardiogram confirmed the presence of the vascular ring. The inner diameter of right and left aortic arch is 9.3 and 9.9 mm. The double aortic arch gives off the common carotid artery and subclavian artery to the left descending aorta.Three months later, the child was scheduled for surgery to correct the vascular ring. After oxygenation with 100% oxygen, anesthesia was induced, the triangle of ductus arteriosus was exposed by pulling the left lung, then an incision was made on the mediastinal pleura at the surface of descending aorta to make the left and right aortic arch free, and finally the right aortic arch was divided at the joint to relieve the compression to trachea and esophagus. The child was ventilated mechanically for 12 hours in Intensive Care Unit. He was relieved of symptoms without any stridor. Then we reperformed a CT scan and airway remodeling on the chest, which showed a slighter narrowing in the lower trachea. But the child refused to do a follow-up check on his lung function test. Then he was discharged on his seventh postoperative day. At follow-up evaluation performed six months after surgery, the patient was free of respiratory problems and pulmonary infections.In this case, a four-year-old boy with a history of recurrent wheezing and coughing is presented. The patient was initially misdiagnosed as severe asthma attack based on his past medical history, persistent symptoms of cough, recurrent wheezing, and airway hyperresponsiveness suggested by lung function test. While the computed tomography angiogram confirmed double aortic arch, the child had tracheal compression due to the DAA leading to the recurrent wheezing and repeated respiratory infection.Double aortic arch is a rare congenital vascular malformation. DAA may be of right dominant (70% case), left dominant (25% case), and balanced type (5%). The ring of the DAA causes the compression of the airway and induced recurrent wheezing [16]. These rare congenital vascular disorders cause a complete or partial encirclement of trachea and esophagus. An early monograph from the Mayo Clinic divided vascular rings into 7 types, but over 95% of cases can be classified in 4 main categories: double aortic arch, right arch/left ligament, innominate artery compression, and pulmonary artery sling. DAA is the most common form of complete vascular ring, which originates when the ascending aorta bifurcates into a right and a left arch, both usually patent; these arches encompass trachea and esophagus and rejoin in the thoracic descending aorta. Symptoms such as stridor, persistent cough, recurrent wheezing, and respiratory infections usually lead to diagnosis and surgical treatment in childhood [17–20].Regarding this case, the boy had recurrent wheezing four times, intermittent cough, shortness of breath, orthopnea, paleness, tachypnea, cyanosis, and a prolonged expiratory crackles at lungs. Those symptoms were more often after age 3, and his lung function test showed airway hyperresponsiveness. Bronchodilator and systemic corticosteroids administration seemed to be partially beneficial. All those were why he was misdiagnosed as asthma for a long time. But it seemed he had something more we could not explain as asthma. His skin prick test and serum dosage of IgE were both negative. His response to the corticosteroid was not as sensitive as other asthma patients. So if an asthma patient was not relieved of symptoms with routine treatment, differential diagnosis is necessary to figure out if other reasons are hiding.Double aortic arch is a rare congenital vascular malformation, but it still causes many misdiagnoses of recurrent wheezing as asthma. The case emphasizes the suspicion for vascular ring due to DAA in children with repeated wheezing and cough when other common etiologies were excluded. Detailed history-taking, following up the treatment, and differential diagnosis are very important for final correct diagnosis.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Seizure Associated Takotsubo Syndrome: A Rare Combination

We are presenting a 61-year-old African American female with past medical history of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and hypertension who presented with multiple episodes of seizures due to noncompliance with antiepileptic medications. She was on telemetry which showed ST alarm. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was ordered and showed ST elevation in anterolateral leads and troponins were positive. Subsequently Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was diagnosed by left ventriculography findings and absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Echocardiogram showed apical hypokinesia, ejection fraction of 40%, and systolic anterior motion of mitral valve with hyperdynamic left ventricle, in the absence of intracoronary thrombus formation in the angiogram. Electroencephalography showed evidence of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She was treated with supportive therapy. This case illustrates importance of ECG in all patients with seizure irrespective of cardiac symptoms as TC could be the cause of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) and may be underdiagnosed and so undertreated.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is increasingly recognized in neurocritical care population especially in postmenopausal females, with subarachnoid haemorrhage being the most common trigger in neurocritical care unit and seizure being the second common cause [1]. This association is underreported and could possibly be a cause of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), but if early diagnosed and properly treated, it is associated with low mortality and is considered reversible in most of the cases.A 61-year-old African American lady with history of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and hypertension admitted with recurrent tonic-clonic seizures secondary to medication noncompliance. She denied chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. She had no family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) or cardiomyopathy. She is a former smoker. She denied alcohol and drug abuse. She was placed under telemetry upon admission and ST elevation alarm was activated after few hours of admission. Her ECG showed ST elevation in anterolateral leads (Figure 1) and troponins I peak to 38.97 ng/mL. Echocardiogram (Figure 2) showed apical hypokinesia, ejection fraction of 40%, and systolic anterior motion of mitral valve with hyperdynamic left ventricle, in the absence of intracoronary thrombus formation in the angiogram (Figure 3). Subsequently patient underwent coronary angiography which showed no evidence of CAD, hypokinetic apex, and ejection fraction of 55%, which were consistent with TC. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed evidence of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated areas of restricted diffusion in left hippocampal gyrus, right side of splenium of corpus callosum, and bilateral temporal lobes related to seizures/postictal status. She was treated with supportive therapy, aspirin, and beta-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, statin, and Depakote. She stabilized without complications. Her seizure was controlled with Depakote.The term “Takotsubo” was first described in 1990 in Japan, taken from the Japanese name for an octopus’ trap, which has a shape that is similar to the systolic apical ballooning appearance of the LV. It is also called stress cardiomyopathy, apical ballooning syndrome, or broken heart syndrome [12]. Since then, many cases of seizure related TC have been reported [2, 13–26]. As per the data of International Takotsubo Registry which included 1750 patients with stress cardiomyopathy, 89.8 percent were women and mean age was 66.4 years [27]. About 27.7% of the patients had emotional triggers compared to 36% incidence of physical triggers. In addition, about 28.5% of patient did not have any evidence of trigger. In one series of 3265 patients with troponin positive acute coronary syndrome, about 1% of patient actually had TC [28]. Diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is based on seven diagnostic criteria which include anatomical features, ECG changes, cardiac biomarkers, and reversibility of the myocardial dysfunction [29].In a case series of 15 patients, about 33.3% were associated with seizures, all of them being generalized type [30]. In a study, there were about 39 cases of seizure related TC patients compared to patients with TSS which was related to causes other than seizure, and it was found that seizure related TC patients were younger (61.5 versus 68.5 years, ), were more frequently males (17 versus 9%,  value of 0.004), and had less frequently chest pain (6 versus 76%,  value of <0.005), higher risk of cardiogenic shock (25 versus 8%,  value of 0.003), and higher risk of recurrence (14 versus 3%,  value of 0.004) [8]. Few studies have shown increment in catecholamine associated with seizure activities [31, 32].In a review which evaluated the possibility of seizure related TC as a cause of SUDEP, 74 cases were described, age was reported to be between 18 and 82 years, 86% were females, and 14% were males; the outcome was reported in 63 of the 74, with full recovery in 97% of the cases, incomplete recovery in none of the patients, and fatal outcome in 3% of cases [33]. The authors concluded no relation exists between TC and SUDEP.It was also found that cardiac arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities were more common in seizure related TC compared to other triggers; the severe clinical picture of seizure related TC is probably related to excess catecholamine surge in those with intractable epilepsy [8]. It is also worth mentioning that patients with seizure related TC rarely present with typical chest pain which could be related to impaired consciousness or sedation due to antiepileptic medications, and given the fact that Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy accounts for 5–30% of all deaths in epilepsy patients, ECG or echocardiogram would be of great help in ruling out TC and early management of TC or related fatal arrhythmia [8, 33].Our patient had both typical and atypical features of TC as she was a postmenopausal female who presented with multiple episodes of seizures with history of underlying epilepsy. Her ECG showed ST-segment elevation and echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of 40%. Patients with typical TC more often presented with an acute psychiatric episode than those with atypical TC (10.5% versus 6.3%) [34], whereas patients with an atypical form presented more often with a neurologic disorder (29.6% versus 22.9%) [34]. Atypical TC accounts for nearly 20% of all cases of TC and has different clinical features than typical TC, including younger patient age, higher frequency of ST-segment depression, higher prevalence of neurologic disease, and less impaired left ventricle ejection fraction [34].Our case was similar to previously reported cases of seizure related TC (Table 1), in the fact that our patient was a postmenopausal female who had incidental finding of ST elevation on telemetry and positive troponins with no chest pain or any cardiac symptoms. The setting was that of an uncontrolled generalized tonic-clonic seizure with characteristic echocardiographic and coronary angiography features and the outcome was favorable and she fully recovered with no complications.This case illustrates importance of ECG in all patients with seizure irrespective of cardiac symptoms as TC could be the cause of SUDEP and may be underdiagnosed and so undertreated. Diagnosing TC in patients after a seizure is essential since treatment of TC may improve the outcome of affected patients. In general, postmenopausal women who present with seizure are admitted to neurocritical care unit for other reasons including strokes and subarachnoid haemorrhage, are at increased risk of TC, and should have baseline ECG ordered and repeat ECG ordered in cases of change in clinical condition, and also we should keep in mind that in this particular group the presentation may be atypical since patients are under the effect of sedatives and antiepileptic medications.The authors have no conflicts of interest.
Pneumomediastinum and Mediastinal Hematoma Secondary to Right Brachiocephalic Vein Thrombectomy Mimicking STEMI
Department of Medicine, Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, NJ 07740,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Prudence Dy; moc.liamg@ydohkecnedurpReceived 12 April 2017; Revised 4 June 2017; Accepted 20 June 2017; Published 18 July 2017Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2017 Prem Shukla et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 50-year-old male with a history of hemodialysis dependent chronic kidney disease presented to our emergency department with acute midsternal crushing chest pain. Patient was diagnosed with acute anterolateral wall Myocardial Infraction due to the presence of corresponding ST segment elevations in EKG and underwent emergent cardiac catheterization which revealed normal patent coronaries without any disease. He continued to have chest pain for which CT of the chest was done which revealed pneumomediastinum with mediastinal hematoma, due to the recent attempted thrombectomy for thrombus in his right brachiocephalic vein.It is absolutely imperative to rule out cardiac ischemia in patients who present with chest pain and ST segment elevation on EKG. Emergent cardiac catheterization is the standard of care across all hospitals in the United States. However, once a cardiac etiology is ruled out other diagnosis should be sought. Around 26% of angiography done in acute phase of suspected STEMI has been shown to be normal [1]. The incidence of alternative conditions mimicking STEMI is around 2.3% [2]. Pneumomediastinum is a rare condition that can mimic STEMI. This case report aims to report pneumomediastinum after unsuccessful right brachiocephalic vein thrombectomy mimicking a STEMI.We present the case of a 50-year-old male with a history of hemodialysis dependent end-stage renal disease, HIV on antiretroviral therapy, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia who presented to our emergency room with stinging nonradiating midsternal chest pain since the afternoon associated with difficulty in breathing. Patient was a former smoker with 29-pack-year smoking history and a former alcoholic. Family history revealed MI in the father at the age of 56. Patient underwent unsuccessful right brachiocephalic vein thrombectomy a day prior to presentation to the emergency room.At the time of physical examination, blood pressure was 128/97 mmHg, heart rate was 84/minute, respiratory rate was 15/minute, temperature was 99.7 F, and SpO2 was 93% in room air. Patient was a moderately built obese male, alert, diaphoretic, and in moderate distress from his chest pain and shortness of breath. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal cardiac sounds, no murmurs/rubs, and no chest wall tenderness. Breath sounds were heard in all lung fields without any added sounds. Peripheral pulses were equal and no delay was noted. His AV Fistula in the right arm had a good palpable thrill. The rest of the exam was unremarkable. There were no signs of brachiocephalic vein thrombosis.Complete blood count with differential showed normocytic normochromic anemia with haemoglobin of 13.2 mg/dl (normal range 13.5–18 mg/dl), white cell count of 8800/cu mm (normal range 4500–11000/cu mm), and platelets of 253,000/cu mm (normal range 140,000–450,000/cu mm). Coagulation profile done was within normal range with PT of 11.1 seconds (normal range 9.6–12.7), INR of 1.0 (normal range 0.9–1.1), and PTT of 30.0 (normal range 2.5–36.9). Serum electrolytes studies showed elevated serum potassium level 5.7 mEq/L (normal range 3.5–5.5 mEq/L) with normal sodium, chloride, calcium, and bicarbonate levels.Renal function tests showed elevated BUN 39 mg/dL (normal range 5–21 mg) and serum creatinine of 9.41 mg/dL (normal range 0.60–1.20 mg/dL) with severely decreased estimated GFR 6 mL/min/1.73 m2 (normal > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Liver function tests showed elevated serum alkaline phosphatase 109 U/L (normal range 25–100 U/L) with normal serum ALT and AST.Initial I done was 0.08 ng/mL (normal: 0.04–0.80 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram (Figure 1) showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and presence of ST elevations in I, aVL, and V1–V4. Also noted were ST depressions in III, aVF, and V6 and incomplete LBBB.Chest X-ray revealed a small right lower lobe infiltrate with subpulmonic effusion. Echocardiography revealed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired LV relaxation with abnormal (paradoxical) septal motion consistent with LBBB, noncompaction of ventricular apex, mild aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation.CT scan of chest revealed pneumomediastinum with mediastinal hematoma as seen in Figure 2.The patient presented to emergency room with acute nonradiating midsternal chest pain with evolving changes in anterior leads in EKG and a CODE STEMI was called for emergent cardiac catheterization as myocardial infarction is the most common and life-threatening condition that was needed to be ruled out in his EKG with ST elevation. Patient received aspirin and ticagrelor prior to catheterization. Coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries but with mild global hypokinesis of the left ventricle that was already known even 6 months prior to this admission. Patient continued to have chest pain which was unrelieved by Nitroglycerin, while serial troponins remained negative and hence computed tomography of chest was done which revealed pneumomediastinum with mediastinal hematoma, likely a consequence of his unsuccessful attempted thrombectomy of his right brachiocephalic pain. Patient received topical as well oral pain medications for symptomatic relief. He did not require any surgical intervention as there was no collapsed lung and the volume of the pneumomediastinum can be absorbed by the body. He remained hemodynamically stable and was eventually discharged home with further follow-up with vascular surgery.Chest pain accounts for around 6 million annual visits to emergency department (ED) in the United States (US). Patients with EKG changes, characteristic symptoms, risk factors, and strong family history undergo emergent cardiac catheterization. However, in around 26% patients who underwent coronary angiograms, coronary arteries were found to be normal. In those patients, the presence of other noncardiac etiologies of acute chest pain needs to be assessed [1–4].Pneumomediastinum is a rare condition described as abnormal presence of air or any other gas in the mediastinum. It can be spontaneous (primary) or secondary. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is usually due to either infection or underlying lung conditions such as COPD or asthma [5]. Activities that cause increase in intrathoracic pressure such as Valsalva, coughing, and vomiting have also been reported to cause cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum [6]. Secondary pneumomediastinum is usually a result of anatomic manipulation of mediastinal structures ranging from dental/endoscopic procedures [7], cardiac catheterizations, and endotracheal intubations to surgical interventions involving the thorax and abdomen. Chest or neck trauma causing tracheobronchial tree disruption has been reported to cause severe secondary tension pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum secondary to injury of major venous vasculature at the time of central line placement has also been reported [8]. We present our case of secondary pneumomediastinum which resulted due to the manipulation of the right brachiocephalic vein, mimicking the signs and symptoms of a STEMI.Apart from chest pain, patients with pneumomediastinum may also present with cough, shortness of breath, or changes in voice. Examination may be needed with Hamman’s crunch or crepitations along the suprasternal notch. In terms of ECG findings, pneumomediastinum presents in various ways such as electrical alternans, T-wave inversions, poor R-wave progression, and low voltage QRS other than ST elevation [9, 10].This is a rare case of secondary pneumomediastinum mimicking STEMI. The presence of other causes of chest pain in patients with normal coronary angiograms should be investigated. Care should be taken to ensure detailed history taking in regard to recent procedures involving the neck and thorax.Learning Points/Take-Home Messages. In patients who have persistent chest pain with normal coronary arteries with cardiac catheterization, history of any thoracic invasive procedures should give rise to suspicion for pneumomediastinum as a differential diagnosis in patients who present with EKG finding of ST elevation.The authors certify that they have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest (such as honoraria, educational grants, participation in speakers’ bureaus, membership, employment, consultancies, stock ownership, or other equity interest and expert testimony or patent-licensing arrangements) or nonfinancial interest (such as personal or professional relationships, affiliations, knowledge, or beliefs) in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Acute Myocardial Infarction Caused by an Anomalous Right Coronary Artery Occlusion Presenting with Precordial ST Elevation
Hospital N.S. Conceição, Porto Alegre, RS,  BrazilCorrespondence should be addressed to Bruno da Silva Matte; moc.liamtoh@ettamonurbReceived 17 March 2017; Accepted 8 June 2017; Published 16 July 2017Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2017 Bruno da Silva Matte  and Alexandre Damiani Azmus. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Acute coronary syndrome with precordial ST segment elevation is usually related to left anterior descending artery occlusion, although isolated right ventricular infarction has been described as a cause of ST elevation in V1–V3 leads. We present a case of a patient with previous inferior wall infarction and new acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to proximal right coronary thrombotic occlusion resulting in right ventricular infarction with precordial ST elevation and sinus node dysfunction. The patient was treated with successful rescue angioplasty achieving resolution of acute symptoms and electrocardiographic abnormalities. Several algorithms were established to locate the culprit vessel in ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with good accuracy [1–3], but in some clinical scenarios including previous myocardial infarction, it can be misleading if thorough electrocardiogram evaluation is not performed. We describe a case in which precordial ST elevation occurred in a patient with proximal right coronary artery acute occlusion and was treated with coronary angioplasty.A 42-year-old male patient with history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and previous myocardial infarction (MI) presented to the emergency department with acute coronary syndrome. His past coronary event was an inferior MI which was treated with thrombolysis six years ago within 7 hours of onset. Catheterization at that time revealed anomalous right coronary artery originating from the left Valsalva sinus with moderate proximal obstruction and the patient received medical treatment. He had recently performed a clinical evaluation with a normal treadmill test and normal echocardiogram in another hospital.He presented to the emergency department of a non-24/7 primary PCI medical centre with acute onset (2 hours) of severe chest pain and diaphoresis. On admission, he was anxious, his blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg, and he had normal heart and lung auscultation. His first electrocardiogram (Figure 1) showed ectopic atrial rhythm, inferior inactive zone, and ST elevation in precordial leads V1–V3 (there were no previous electrocardiogram tracings available for comparison). He was treated with IV hydration, acetylsalicylic acid 300 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg, and thrombolysis with Tenecteplase 40 mg with improvement of peripheral perfusion and blood pressure. However, due to persistent chest pain, emergent coronary angiography was performed four hours later. Left main and circumflex were free of significant obstruction and left anterior descending artery had a moderate systolic dynamic compression caused by intramyocardial bridging in the mid segment with normal TIMI flow (Figure 2). Right coronary artery had its anomalous origin close to the left coronary sinus and was occluded in the proximal segment (Figure 3).Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in the right coronary artery through right radial approach using Amplatz 1 (6 French) guiding catheter. He received 8,000 U of unfractioned heparin. The lesion was easily crossed with a Runthrough 0.014 guidewire and predilated with a 2,5 × 20 mm balloon with flow restoration. A Zotarolimus eluting stent (Endeavor) 2,75 × 24 mm was implanted at 12 atm and postdilated with a 3,0 mm balloon at 20 atm with clinical and angiographic success. At the end of the procedure, the patient was asymptomatic and ECG showed resolution of ST elevation.The patient had in-hospital course free of complications and predischarge evaluation revealed normal left and right ventricular function (ejection fraction 59%) and complete resolution of precordial electrocardiogram abnormalities and return to normal sinus rhythm (Figure 4). The patient was discharged six days after admission taking acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, metoprolol 100 mg BID, and enalapril 10 mg BID. After an uneventful one-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic.Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with precordial ST segment elevation is usually related to left anterior descending coronary artery thrombotic occlusion and is rarely seen in proximal right coronary occlusion [4]. Electrocardiogram is essential to locate the culprit vessel in AMI and extremely relevant for clinical reasons such as correct identification of AMI type and prognosis but also to guide the choice of devices in the catheterization laboratory. Although several algorithms were established to locate the culprit vessel with good results, their accuracy is compromised in some scenarios including previous myocardial infarction, coronary anomalies, previous coronary artery bypass surgery, left bundle block, and paced rhythms.Some case reports counteract the classical electrocardiogram finding of ST elevation in DII, DIII, and AVF for right coronary acute occlusion, with most of them being the result of isolated right ventricular myocardial infarction (RVMI) when precordial ST elevation can occur [5–7]. Interestingly, Kanovsky el al. [8] reported in a survey of 300 patients with electrocardiographic defined RVMI (V4R ST segment elevation) that the culprit vessel was the right coronary artery in only 48% of the cases, the left anterior descending artery in 47%, and the circumflex artery in 5% of cases. One should also note that in this study RV function was not evaluated and we could only infer it to be worse in patients with RCA occlusion because of the greater magnitude of RV branches from this vessel. Zheng et al. [9] have selected some aspects that would suggest RCA occlusion/RVMI when precordial ST elevation is present: decreasing magnitude of ST segment elevation from V1 to V3, convex ST elevation, concomitant sinus node dysfunction, and V3-V4R ST elevation. Also, the authors suggest a complementary bedside evaluation with echocardiography in which RV dilation would add to the electrocardiogram approach.In the reported case, the patient had a mild cardiogenic shock presentation due to STEMI with failed thrombolysis and clear angiographic definition of RCA as the culprit vessel, without significant stenosis on the left coronary artery. Rather important too, the RCA occlusion was proximal to the RV branches and “isolated” RVMI in the setting of a previous inferior wall myocardial infarction was considered the cause of the precordial ST elevation without ST elevation in leads DII, DIII, and AVF. Also noteworthy, sinus node dysfunction was present as ectopic atrial rhythm was shown at presentation and normalized to sinus rhythm only after reperfusion. Some of the above-mentioned electrocardiographic features were present such as convex ST elevation and sinus node dysfunction but decreasing ST elevation from V1 to V3 was not seen in this case. Unfortunately, because our institution only performs right precordial leads on admission in inferior myocardial infarctions, we do not have data on V3-V4R leads which we believe would be showing ST elevation.Although uncommon in proximal RCA occlusion, the electrocardiographic pattern shown in this case may lead to erroneous culprit vessel definition and treatment delay in this severe clinical scenario. Thorough ECG evaluation and complementary quick bedside evaluation can improve diagnosis and shorten door-to-balloon time and result in better patient prognosis.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Fulminant Myocarditis Managed by Extracorporeal Life Support (Impella® CP): A Rare Case
Clinic for Cardiology, Herz- und Diabeteszentrum NRW, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bad Oeynhausen,  GermanyCorrespondence should be addressed to Henrik Fox; ed.wrn-zdh@xofhReceived 27 February 2017; Revised 22 May 2017; Accepted 15 June 2017; Published 12 July 2017Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2017 Henrik Fox et al.

Treating myocarditis can be difficult, as clear criteria for diagnosis and management are lacking for heterogeneous clinical presentations. Case Description. We report a case of a 49-year-old female who presented with cardiogenic shock and subsequent cardiac arrest. Extracorporeal life support was instituted, and after eight days with Impella CP the patient recovered and at six months presented with normal cardiac function. Conclusion. Fulminant myocarditis remains a challenging disease in daily clinical practice, not only for diagnosis, but also for treatment. With this report we emphasize that myocardial failure due to fulminant myocarditis may be reversible if treated with extracorporeal life support, which thus plays an important and life-saving role.In daily clinical practice, acute myocarditis remains a challenge, as diagnosis may be difficult and is often missed due to its clinical heterogeneity [1]. Clear criteria for diagnosis and management are lacking for the wide and heterogeneous clinical presentations, which complicate patient identification and consensus on the most appropriate treatment [1]. Accepted is the WHO (World Health Organization)/IFC (International Society and Federation of Cardiology/World Heart Federation) definition [1], diagnosed by histological, immunological, and immunohistochemical criteria [2] and Dallas criteria [3].In cases of fulminant course with cardiogenic shock, extracorporeal life support may be the only treatment to overcome acute heart failure [4]. We report a case of an unusual myocarditis, with the patient surviving through extracorporeal life support.A 49-year-old female, with no former relevant medical history and no former regular medication, had reported flu-like symptoms with physical weakness, dizziness, headache, and chills. After three days she collapsed and on admission to hospital an advanced cardiogenic shock with initial left ventricular ejection fraction of 10% was seen. Hemodynamic monitoring revealed a cardiac index of 1.8 l/min/m2. Arterial blood gas analysis showed serum lactate of 3.7 mmol/l and elevated transaminases (GOT 2624 (0–35) U/l, GPT 2234 (0–35) U/l), cardiac markers (creatine kinase 1730 (0–145) U/l, high sensitive troponin-I 93430 (0–26) pg/ml) were significantly elevated, with no signs of acute myocardial infarction in the ECG (Figure 1). The patient suffered cardiac arrest (Figure 2) and was treated with catecholamines as well as a calcium sensitizer (Levosimendan, Simdax®, Orion Corporation, Espoo, Finland), but for stabilization an Impella CP (Abiomed Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) was necessary (Figure 3).The patient underwent coronary angiography for exclusion of coronary artery disease and myocardial biopsy for further assessment. Blood and biopsy specimens were tested for common causative agents, such as Coxsackieviruses A and B, echoviruses, polioviruses, influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, mumps virus, measles virus, rubella virus, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, Chikungunya virus, human immunodeficiency virus-1, adenoviruses, parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus-6, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, and herpes simplex virus, as recommended [1], but none of these triggers was detected.During the following days, left ventricular systolic function improved and after 8 days Impella was explanted. After six months, LVEF was 55%, and the patient lives a normal life.Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) was taken. Viral PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in RNA-stabilized EMB and EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) blood demonstrated absence of infectious causative organisms. Histological analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, and hematoxylin/eosin-stained EMB showed infiltration of mononuclear cells, myocardial damage, and interstitial fibrosis (Dallas criteria [1, 3]). Immunohistology detected numerous CD3-positive T-lymphocytes and a number of CD68-positive and MHCII-overexpressing macrophages (Figure 4).In clinical routine, myocarditis may be missed, as postmortem studies in prospective settings showed frequencies in young adults with sudden cardiac death in 8.6% to 12% of cases [1]. Facilities for diagnosis have advanced in recent years, as molecular techniques allow a more precise insight into inflammatory autoimmune processes [1]. Morbidity and mortality of myocarditis is well known, while the broad variety of etiologies impede universal recommendations and clinical practice guidelines [1]. Moreover, outcome and prognosis of myocarditis depend on its etiology, clinical presentation, and the stage of the disease at presentation to medical professionals [1, 2, 5]. The percentage of patients who develop persistent cardiac dysfunction or deteriorate acutely is unknown [1, 2] and treatment of many forms of myocarditis is symptomatic only [1]. Endomyocardial biopsy and immunohistochemical analysis are absolutely important, not only to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis, but also to identify cases where specific therapy is available, such as giant cell myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis, or sarcoidosis [1]. Biventricular dysfunction at presentation has been reported as the main predictor of death, in need for assist device or transplantation [1, 2]. Myocarditis may clinically present in many different ways, ranging from mild symptoms of chest pain and palpitations only to life-threatening cardiogenic shock and ventricular arrhythmia [1] as presented in this case, making early diagnosis often very difficult. In many centers, endomyocardial biopsy is not generally performed, because of possible complications, which however are low in experienced teams [1, 5–7]. However, endomyocardial biopsy is of utmost importance in cases like this to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis possibly by referring the patient to a specialized center. Furthermore, the underlying etiology of myocarditis has to be identified leading to a specific treatment in cases such as giant cell, eosinophilic myocarditis, or sarcoidosis, which need a different treatment [1, 5–7]. Our approach was successful in this rare case and although no infectious, immune-mediated, or toxic reason was detectable here, biopsy confirmed our treatment strategy and ensured not to have missed any specifically treatable cause. This is in accordance with current literature [1–10].Fulminant myocarditis is believed to differ from a subacute or acute lymphocytic myocarditis in its mode of onset and the degree of hemodynamic compromise, but data is scarce in adult patients [1]. With this report we intend to emphasize that myocardial failure due to fulminant myocarditis may be reversible if treated with temporary extracorporeal life support being an important and life-saving tool to be considered in such severe cases. Nevertheless, further research in this field is needed to achieve improved outcome, such as reported in our case.Christian Flottmann has received reimbursements of travel expenses from Abiomed.

Isolated Major Aortopulmonary Collateral as the Sole Pulmonary Blood Supply to an Entire Lung Segment
Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Hannah S. Kim; ude.ltsuw@mik.hannahReceived 27 April 2017; Accepted 14 June 2017; Published 12 July 2017Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2017 Hannah S. Kim et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Congenital systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries or major aortopulmonary collaterals are associated with cyanotic congenital heart disease with decreased pulmonary blood flow. Though it is usually associated with congenital heart diseases, there is an increased incidence of isolated acquired aortopulmonary collaterals in premature infants with chronic lung disease. Interestingly, isolated congenital aortopulmonary collaterals can occur without any lung disease, which may cause congestive heart failure and require closure. We present a neonate with an echocardiogram that showed only left-sided heart dilation. Further workup with a CT angiogram demonstrated an anomalous systemic artery from the descending thoracic aorta supplying the left lower lobe. He eventually developed heart failure symptoms and was taken to the catheterization laboratory for closure of the collateral. However, with the collateral being the only source of blood flow to the entire left lower lobe, he required surgical unifocalization. Isolated aortopulmonary collaterals without any other congenital heart disease or lung disease are rare. Our patient is the first reported case to have an isolated aortopulmonary collateral being the sole pulmonary blood supply to an entire lung segment. Due to its rarity, there is still much to learn about the origin and development of these collaterals that possibly developed prenatally.Congenital systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries or major aortopulmonary collaterals (MAPCAs) are well recognized and associated with cyanotic congenital heart disease (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia), where there is a decrease in antegrade pulmonary blood flow. In this lesion, aortopulmonary collaterals arise from the systemic arteries and supply majority of the lung parenchyma [1–4]. Acquired aortopulmonary collaterals (APCs) can occur in isolation, secondary to chronic alveolar hypoxia due to inflammatory, neoplastic, or traumatic lung disease. Reportedly, there is also an increased incidence of isolated aortopulmonary collaterals in very low birth weight infants with chronic lung disease. Most of these collaterals are small and inconsequential that regress spontaneously over time [5–10]. In addition, there have been few case reports describing isolated congenital aortopulmonary collateral in those without any lung disease, who presented with congestive heart failure requiring closure via catheterization intervention [11, 12]. We describe here an interesting case of an isolated large aortopulmonary collateral supplying the entire lower lobe of the left lung without dual blood supply, in the presence of a normal intracardiac anatomy or lung disease.An ex 35 weeker, dichorionic-diamniotic twin A, was born to a 26-year-old G1P2 via caesarean section for pregnancy induced hypertension. His birthweight was 2.06 kg and Apgars were 9,9 at one and five minutes of life. At 3 days of life, patient had a murmur and echocardiogram performed showed a mildly dilated left atrium (LA) without any intracardiac lesions. Two weeks later, a follow-up echo showed progression of the LA dilation, left ventricle dilation, and significant pulmonary venous return from the left lower pulmonary vein, without evidence of a PDA. A Computer Tomography Angiogram was performed to look for vascular anomalies. The imaging showed a large anomalous systemic artery arising from the descending thoracic aorta supplying the left lower lobe. Because he was stable on room air and gaining weight appropriately, we deemed it reasonable to intervene in the APC when he was older, to decrease the vascular injury risks of a cardiac catheterization procedure. However, when he was seen as an outpatient, it was reported that the patient was becoming more tachypneic and not gaining weight as well. Thus, he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for possible closure of the APC.Data from cardiac catheterization showed normal baseline cardiac index (5.79 L/min/m2) with normal intracardiac pressures and no intracardiac shunting. The pulmonary artery pressure (15/10 mmHg, mean 13 mmHg) and transpulmonary gradient (5 mmHg) were normal. Aortic cineangiogram showed a large aortopulmonary collateral supplying the entire left lower lung (Figure 1). A digital subtraction cineangiography performed in the left pulmonary artery (LPA) showed flow only to the left upper lobe (Figure 2). Since the APC was the only source of left lower lung perfusion, it was not closed at this time.He then underwent surgical unifocalization of the left major aortopulmonary collateral artery onto the left pulmonary artery. The APC itself would not reach the left pulmonary artery and required a segment of the aorta for unifocalization. With that, the aorta was reconstructed with an end to end anastomosis of the descending aorta. Routine postoperative care was taken and he was discharged home safely after 5 days.The morphologic development of the pulmonary circulation is complex. The intrapulmonary pulmonary arteries arise from the lung buds and the extrapulmonary arteries arise from the proximal portion of the sixth aortic arch. The main pulmonary artery is derived from the truncoaortic sac. At about day 27, the arterial branches of the paired sixth aortic arches form an anastomosis with the intrapulmonary pulmonary arteries. With further development, the branches from the aortic arches enlarge and the descending aorta becomes smaller. When the normal connections fail to develop, collaterals persist.Major aortopulmonary collaterals may be associated with single ventricle physiology congenital heart diseases such as tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. These MAPCAs form early in embryological development due to lack of adequate antegrade pulmonary blood flow in utero. These connections become an additive or sole pulmonary blood supply and thus essential for survival. Though MAPCAs are usually associated with congenital heart diseases, aortopulmonary collaterals that are isolated and occur without intracardiac pulmonary obstruction have also been described. These isolated APCs may develop postnatally in very low birth weight infants who required prolonged ventilator support and in infants with hypoxia due to parenchymal lung disease. The APCs are usually small and regress on their own after treatment of the lung disease. Isolated APCs without cardiopulmonary malformation can also occur and are truly rare. There have only been few case reports in literature with successful transcathether closure after confirmation of another source of pulmonary blood flow to that segment of the lung. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report in literature describing an isolated aortopulmonary collateral, with no other cardiopulmonary disease, being the sole blood supply to an entire lobe of the lung. In addition, the patient, albeit premature, had birth weight greater than 1500 g not requiring any ventilator support. Altogether, this suggests an isolated aortopulmonary collateral artery that developed possibly due to faulty embryologic development of the left sided 6th aortic arch or pulmonary arch responsible for development of the LPA, providing supply only to the left upper lobe.Isolated aortopulmonary collaterals in a healthy neonate without any other congenital heart disease or lung disease are rare. Our patient is the first reported case to have an isolated large aortopulmonary collateral being the sole pulmonary blood supply to an entire lung segment. Therefore, we did not proceed with coiling of the APC. Due to its rarity, there is still much to learn about the origin and development of these collaterals that possibly developed prenatally.This article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.The authors do not have any conflicts of interest.
Combination of Carbon Dioxide Angiography and Outback® Elite for Revascularization of a Patient with Renal Insufficiency with Bilateral Femoropopliteal Chronic Total Occlusions
Department of Cardiology, Nishinomiya Municipal Central Hospital, Nishinomiya,  JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Yuhei Nojima; moc.liamg@amijoniehuyReceived 27 February 2017; Accepted 8 June 2017; Published 9 July 2017Academic Editor: Ramazan AkdemirCopyright © 2017 Yuhei Nojima et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A new reentry device (Outback Elite) system has been available in Japan since June 2016. This new device enables easier treatment of chronic total occlusion (CTO) in the lower extremities. We report a case of a woman in her 70s who underwent revascularization using this new device twice to treat both of her femoropopliteal CTO lesions. She was referred to our hospital complaining of intermittent claudication in both legs. She had a long history of diabetes mellitus complicated with severe chronic kidney disease. Her estimated glomerular filtration rate was <20. She refused surgical revascularization; therefore, we performed our treatment without iodine contrast medium. First, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to confirm that the CTO lesions had caused severe claudication before intervention. Subsequently, the Outback Elite device and carbon dioxide (CO2) angiography made it possible to revascularize both of her legs without iodine contrast medium. At 6 months after the procedures, we did not observe exacerbation of claudication in her legs.Iodine contrast medium is considered as the gold standard for endovascular treatment (EVT) because it provides much information needed to select a treatment strategy. However, the problem of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remains associated with EVT. In high-risk patients, such as those with chronic renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure and the elderly, the incidence of CIN is >20%–30% [1]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) angiography is an alternative method that has been used since the 1970s for patients with renal impairment or hypersensitivity to iodine [2]. Subintimal angioplasty (SIA) with recanalization of SFA-CTO is an acceptable first-line therapy that was first described by Bolia et al. [3]. However, the reentry procedure often becomes difficult when the wire crosses the distal true lumen after excessive reach beyond the subintimal space. The Outback Elite is a new device that can lead to successful outcomes of revascularization in SFA-CTO. Here we report a patient with chronic renal impairment who underwent revascularization using the reentry device with CO2 angiography guidance in bilateral SFA-CTO.A 76-year-old woman with a long history of diabetes mellitus was referred to our hospital with complaints of severe claudication in bilateral lower limbs. She had noticed claudication symptoms approximately 10 years earlier. Recently, she could not walk 100 m without needing to rest. Her long history of diabetes mellitus required that she take multiple oral medications but not insulin. Unfortunately, her condition was complicated by diabetic nephropathy. Laboratory studies revealed increased HbA1c level [6.7% (NGSP); reference value (RV) 4.6%–6.2%], blood urea nitrogen (45.3 mg/dL; RV 7–22 mg/dL), creatinine (2.07 mg/dL; RV 0.4–0.8 mg/dL), and a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate of 19.16. The ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) was 0.72 on the right side and 0.74 on the left side. We gave her the option of one of two revascularization methods: femoropopliteal bypass surgery or EVT. Both treatments have benefits and disadvantages for patients. After careful consideration, she decided to undergo revascularization by EVT. Before EVT, we needed more information about the status of her arteries in both legs; therefore, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI results confirmed that both of her SFAs were occluded from bifurcation of the deep femoral artery (Figure 1).Initially, we performed EVT for the left SFA-CTO. A 6 Fr Destination® catheter (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted from the right femoral artery into the left common femoral artery as a contralateral antegrade wiring approach. A 0.018-inch Treasure® guidewire (Asahi Intecc Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) with a NaviCross® microcatheter (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was able to penetrate the proximal fibrous cap of the CTO. After advancing the microcatheter into the CTO site a little, we exchanged the 0.018-inch wire for a hydrophilic 0.035-inch, 1.5-mm, J-type, shaped-tip wire. A knuckle-shaped hydrophilic 0.035-inch wire was used to easily cross the middle of the CTO site and to eventually capture the distal site of the CTO. The 0.035-inch wire was not in the true lumen, however, so we subsequently used a reentry device called an Outback Elite catheter (Cordis, Florida, USA) to attempt to gain access to the true lumen. The device was delivered to the distal subintimal space adjacent to the reconstructed area of the distal true lumen, and some effort was needed to successfully penetrate using a hollow needle. Two orthogonal angiographic views were taken to confirm the correct direction: an L-shaped fluoroscopic marker enabled orientation of the tip toward the reentry site and, to attain the appropriate position, we needed to fine-tune the positioning at the site and used a T-shaped fluoroscopic marker to confirm the desired alignment. Next, a 22 G nitinol reentry cannula was plunged into the distal true lumen in the distal SFA. A 0.014-inch Chevalier Floppy® extrasupport wire (Cordis, Florida, USA) was advanced into the true lumen. Then, the reentry device was removed, and we used a SABER X® 5 × 60 mm (Cordis, Florida, USA) to perform balloon dilatation in the CTO lesion. Next, two 6.0 × 100 mm SMART® stents (Cordis, Florida, USA) were implanted from the proximal to middle portion of the left SFA. We performed postballoon dilatation using the same balloon. All procedures were performed without iodine contrast medium. The patient’s left ABI improved from 0.74 to 0.98.One month after the procedure for the left SFA-CTO, we performed EVT for the right SFA-CTO. A 6 Fr Parent Plus60™ sheath was inserted from the right femoral artery as an ipsilateral antegrade wiring approach. A 0.018-inch Treasure guidewire with a 4.0 Fr CXI™ support catheter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) was used to penetrate the fibrous cap of the CTO. Advancing the microcatheter into the CTO site, we exchanged the 0.018-inch wire for a hydrophilic 0.035-inch, 1.5-mm, J-type, shaped-tip wire. A knuckle-shaped hydrophilic 0.035-inch wire was used to reach the distal site of the CTO. The 0.035-inch wire was intended to be placed in the false lumen, but subsequent attempts to gain access to the true lumen were performed using an Outback Elite catheter. We performed CO2 angiography to guide exact positioning of the needle and stents. A 0.014-inch extrasupport wire was advanced into the true lumen. Then, the reentry device was removed, and we performed balloon dilatation using a 5 × 60 mm balloon in the CTO lesion. Subsequently, two SMART stents (7.0 × 100 mm and 6.0 × 150 mm) were implanted from the proximal to middle portion of the right SFA. We performed postballoon dilatation using the same balloon. All procedures were performed without iodine contrast medium. Subsequent examinations showed that the patient’s left ABI improved from 0.72 to 0.91.Generally speaking, expansion of a subintimal stent is less than that of an intraplaque stent and contributes to long-term outcomes, particularly in coronary arteries. For treating CTO, intraplaque angioplasty (IPA) is preferable over SIA to maintain chronic patency for CTO lesions. However, some studies have found no statistically significant differences between IPA and SIA for treating SFA-CTO [4–6]. Therefore, we have frequently adopted SIA using a 0.035-inch knuckled-wire technique. This technique is feasible and easy to perform except for reentering the distal true lumen at the CTO site [4, 5]. However, the guidewire may not pass the subintimal lumen in all cases. Otherwise, the intraluminal procedure using a 0.014- or 0.018-inch guide wire does not always succeed in capturing the distal true lumen. If the distal true lumen cannot be captured, retrograde access may be a useful and feasible option [7]. However, the retrograde technique requires a certain amount of experience with EVT. Thus, a reentry device was developed to overcome procedural failures and improve success rates after subintimal passage through the CTO. Recent studies have reported >95% procedural success rates in achieving revascularization using the Outback catheter [8]. In contrast, Shin et al. found that significant calcification at the reentry site was a strong predictor of procedural failure after use of this reentry device [9]. Our patient underwent EVT for CTOs in both SFAs, and these revascularizations intentionally needed the reentry device in both of her legs. The first session used the contralateral approach, and the second session used the ipsilateral approach. On the basis of our experience, if using a reentry device, the ipsilateral approach would be preferred to the contralateral approach. The contralateral approach makes it more difficult for a reentry device to cross over the aortic bifurcation; therefore, in this approach, previous dilatation of the subintimal lumen is required to insert such a bulky device. In our 2 experiences, use of a reentry device required more time in the contralateral approach than in the ipsilateral approach. Therefore, we recommend using and/or being prepared to use the ipsilateral approach with a 6 Fr system as a standby if this new reentry device is used. Lastly, operators should be aware of characteristics of CO2 angiography. CO2 angiography is particularly advantageous for patients at risk of CIN and allergic reactions against iodine contrast medium (ICM) [2]. Moreover, we consider CO2 as effective as ICM within the femoropopliteal lesions [10]. Complications following the CO2 angiography have been reported, including vapor-lock, which occurs upon entrapment of CO2 at the origin of a vessel, thereby impairing flow and potentially resulting in bowel ischemia especially in EVT for aortoiliac or renal lesions [11].To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to use an Outback Elite catheter under CO2 angiography. Six months after the procedure, we did not observe exacerbation of claudication in our patient’s legs. We found that CO2 angiography for treating SFA-CTO lesions was useful and effective. EVT for SFA-CTO using SIA or IPA would be expected to give the same results. This combination therapeutic technique could potentially lead to a new intervention era in which contrast dye is not needed.The authors declare that there were no conflicts of interest related to this study.
Lyme Carditis Buried Beneath ST-Segment Elevations

There are nearly 30,000 cases of Lyme disease reported to the CDC each year, with 3-4% of those cases reporting Lyme carditis. The most common manifestation of Lyme carditis is partial heart block following bacterial-induced inflammation of the conducting nodes. Here we report a 45-year-old gentleman that presented to the hospital with intense nonradiating chest pressure and tightness. Lab studies were remarkable for elevated troponins. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with mild ST elevations. Three weeks prior to hospital presentation, patient had gone hunting near Madison. One week prior to admission, he noticed an erythematous lesion on his right shoulder. Because of his constellation of history, arthralgias, and carditis, he was started on ceftriaxone to treat probable Lyme disease. This case illustrates the importance of thorough history taking and extensive physical examination when assessing a case of possible acute myocardial infarction. Because Lyme carditis is reversible, recognition of this syndrome in young patients, whether in the form of AV block, myocarditis, or acute myocardial ischemia, is critical to the initiation of appropriate antibiotics in order to prevent permanent heart block, or even death.A 45-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the hospital with left sided chest pain that did not radiate. For the four days prior to admission, patient had a nondocumented fever, diffuse muscle aches, neck and back stiffness, headache, chills, diaphoresis, and nausea. He denied photophobia, blurry vision, sore throat, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. On the morning of hospital admission, he woke up with intense chest pressure, relieved with nitroglycerin given in the Emergency Department. On examination, patient was in no acute distress and alert and oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature was 37.7°C, pulse 95 beats/minute, blood pressure 135/74, respiratory rate 24 per minute, and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Cardiac examination demonstrated normal rate, with no murmurs rubs or gallops. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin exam revealed a 4 × 3 cm erythematous, targetoid bulls-eye lesion on his right shoulder (Figure 1).Labs were obtained and were remarkable for creatine kinase 113 U/L (normal 52–336 U/L), CK-MB 4.6 ng/mL (normal < or = 7.7 ng/mL), and troponin T 0.091 ng/mL (normal < 0.01 ng/mL). CBC and LFTs were within normal limits. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with mild ST elevations in the inferior and high lateral leads and Q waves in III and aVF (Figure 2). Following EKG, he was taken for left heart catheterization. Left coronary angiogram revealed normal coronaries. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormalities or effusion. Further laboratory workup included Lyme titers and confirmatory Western blot analysis which were positive with Lyme IgG/IgM = 1.30 (normal < 0.90).Three weeks prior to hospital presentation, the patient had gone hunting near Madison. One week prior to admission, he noticed an erythematous lesion on his right shoulder. It had progressed from a small bug bite to a larger, 4 × 3 cm erythematous, painless, nonpruritic, targetoid bull-eyes rash. Because of his constellation of history, arthralgias, and carditis, Infectious Disease was consulted and he was treated empirically for Lyme carditis with ceftriaxone 2.0 grams IV daily. He was also followed with repeat EKG every two days to monitor AV blocks. Prior to discharge, he was switched to oral doxycycline therapy as recommended by Infectious Disease. His symptoms improved and his liver function tests normalized after treatment.Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is carried to human hosts by infected ticks. Borrelia burgdorferi is a member of the spirochete family and survives within a vector, the Ixodes tick. There are nearly 30,000 cases of Lyme disease reported to the CDC each year, with 3-4% of those cases reporting Lyme carditis [1]. Lyme disease is notoriously known as the “great imitator” because of its ability to mimic other nonspecific diseases, often leading to delayed or incorrect diagnoses [2]. The goal of this discussion is to identify the pathology and presentation of various forms of Lyme carditis, focusing on the least reported, and perhaps the most rare, presentation, which is of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.There are three described stages of Lyme disease: acute illness, dissemination, and the chronic phase [3]. Acute Lyme disease is characterized by erythema migrans. Dissemination phase presents with arthralgias, myalgia, and carditis. In the final and chronic stage of Lyme disease, the host often suffers debilitating arthritis. This discussion will focus on the cardiac implications of Lyme disease inoculation.As stated earlier, Lyme carditis affects only 3-4% of people with Lyme disease. Interestingly, there is a reported 3 : 1 male : female ratio in patients contracting Lyme carditis [4]. Lyme carditis falls into two distinct categories: conduction disturbances and other complications. The most common conduction disturbance is third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, with 49% of patients with Lyme carditis reporting a 3rd-degree AV block [4]. These tend to resolve within 6 weeks when inflammation of the myocardium subsides. While AV blocks are the most common presentation of Lyme carditis, other cardiac complications have been described including pericarditis [5], pericardial effusion [6], dilated cardiomyopathy [7], ischemia, and degenerative cardiac valvular disease [8].Here is a case of a 45-year-old gentleman who presented with left sided chest pain, biomarkers, and electrocardiographic findings consistent with myocardial infarction who was later diagnosed with Lyme carditis. Diagnosis of Lyme carditis can be difficult as the disease can present in a variety of ways. Serologic examination in two steps is the recommended method of disease detection. The first test is a screening assay with an ELISA followed by an immunoassay Western blot. Early stages of the disease can result in false negatives and clinical presentation, with a compelling history for potential tick-borne disease, must be weighed heavily when making a diagnosis.This case illustrates the importance of thorough history taking and extensive physical examination when assessing a case of possible acute myocardial infarction. Lyme carditis is an uncommon cause of a comparatively common hospital presentation of acute myocardial infarction. Because Lyme carditis is reversible, prompt recognition, whether in the form of AV block, myopericarditis, or ischemia, is of upmost importance to prevent complications such as permanent heart block, or even death.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Development of New Deep Venous Thrombosis While on Apixaban
1Department of Internal Medicine, Easton Hospital, Easton, PA,  USA2Drexel University College of Medicine, Electrophysiology Department, Easton Hospital, Easton, PA,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Munish Sharma; moc.liamg@demtnihsinumReceived 24 April 2017; Revised 17 May 2017; Accepted 29 May 2017; Published 20 June 2017Academic Editor: Konstantinos P. LetsasCopyright © 2017 Munish Sharma et al.

Predictable pharmacokinetics, avoidance of routine laboratory monitoring, and lesser drug interactions have made NOACs safer and more tolerable treatment option in comparison to warfarin. However, cases of treatment failure mainly due to interindividual variation in plasma drug levels can be seen rarely. In this report we describe a case of acute DVT of right lower extremity in a patient who was on apixaban for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to underlying nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).NOACs including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are used for the prevention of stroke and peripheral thromboembolism in NVAF and for treatment and prophylaxis of VTE. Compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin, NOACs have more predictable pharmacokinetics and do not need to be routinely monitored in lab for their plasma level. Their efficacy and safety relative to warfarin have been established in the major clinical trials [1–3]. However, due to the variation in the plasma drug level between the individuals, some patients may be at increased risk of treatment failure or bleeding events. Two of the major trials conducted on NOACs have also reported the wide variation in plasma drug level among the patients [4, 5]. We present a case of medication compliant patient who developed acute DVT of his right lower extremity in spite of being on apixaban 5 mg twice daily for VTE prophylaxis in the setting of persistent NVAF.On 4/7/2017, an 80-year-old male with history of recurrent/persistent symptomatic NVAF refractory to optimal medical therapy and multiple cardioversions, hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status after angioplasty with stent deployment to right coronary artery in 2001 underwent comprehensive electrophysiologic study, 3-dimensional mapping, intracardiac ultrasound, and AF ablation with pulmonary vein isolation. Vascular access was obtained through right femoral vein catheterization for the catheter ablation. He was on dabigatran 150 mg twice daily since the initial diagnosis of AF for thromboembolic prophylaxis but 3 months prior to this admission his anticoagulation was switched to apixaban 5 mg twice daily due to coverage issues with medical insurance. He was medication compliant. Apixaban was immediately resumed after AF ablation. Two days after the AF ablation, patient had ecchymosis and swelling of the right groin and an arterial Doppler study revealed a pseudoaneurysm arising from the common femoral artery measuring 3.5 × 2.1 × 2 cm. This was treated with thrombin injection. He was discharged home on metoprolol 100 mg twice daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and apixaban 5 mg twice daily.On 4/18/2017, patient was readmitted to the hospital because of new onset swelling and redness of right lower extremity that started 5 days after previous hospital discharge. A venous Doppler of the right lower extremity showed acute nonocclusive DVT in the common femoral and the distal external iliac vein (Figures 1 and 2). On examination, vitals were stable with normal sinus rhythm. There was no carotid bruit. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2, regular at a rate of 70 bpm with no evidence of murmur/rub or gallop. Right lower extremity showed pitting pedal edema extending up to the mid shin level. There was no worsening of the hematoma in the right groin region. International normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and platelets and fibrinogen level were normal. Anti-factor Xa was not measured. In view of new onset DVT, apixaban was discontinued and patient was started on a heparin drip bridged with warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2-3. His other home medications were continued with the plan to follow up as an outpatient.VTE has an annual incidence of 1 to 2 cases per 1000 people in the general population [6]. Conventional treatment consists of a parenteral anticoagulant, such as enoxaparin, for at least 5 days, and warfarin begun during this time and continued for at least 3 months. Recently, the use of warfarin for treatment and prevention of pulmonary embolism, DVT, and AF has significantly declined with increasing preference for NOACs. Need for frequent monitoring of individualized dosing to maintain INR within a narrow therapeutic range, need for bridging therapy with parenteral anticoagulants, and significant risk of bleeding events have been obviated with advent of NOACs. Warfarin has been found to have twice as many major bleeding episodes compared to placebo with a target INR between 2.0 and 3.0 [7, 8]. Conversely, predictable pharmacokinetics, exclusion of laboratory monitoring of the plasma drug level, lesser drug interactions, and fewer chances of adverse event such as bleeding episodes have made NOACs safer and more tolerable treatment option. Apixaban is one such NOAC, which acts by inhibiting the cleavage of prothrombin into thrombin during the final step of coagulation cascade. Apixaban for the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep-Vein Thrombosis as First-Line Therapy (AMPLIFY) trial showed noninferiority when compared with warfarin in the treatment and prophylaxis of VTE with a significant reduction in bleeding events. It also showed very low recurrence rate of 0.68% by day 7 of initiation of treatment indicating that the early recurrence of thromboembolic event is uncommon with apixaban [9]. With emerging reports of variability in the efficacy and safety of the NOACs among certain patient subgroups [10], question of tailoring therapy by means of plasma drug levels has started to linger in the mind of many. Though studies on some of the NOACs have recommended to personalize the dose based on patient characteristics such as age, sex, and creatinine clearance, there are certain circumstances in which the direct quantification of a NOACs plasma level is thought to be more informative [11]. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry can be used to directly measure plasma drug concentration of NOACs but they are not widely available. Also, standard assays such as PT/INR level vary greatly depending on the reagent and analyzer used. There are certain systematic reviews of laboratory measurements of NOACs that have been published recently. Among them, anti-factor Xa activity has been considered sensitive throughout therapeutic range when calibrated to apixaban. Normal anti-FXa level excludes significant drug levels. The limited availability of this test makes it difficult to be routinely used [12, 13].In our case, patient was compliant with his prescribed apixaban dose, there was no significant delay in resumption of apixaban after catheter ablation of AF, and he had no history of coagulation disorder in himself or family member and did not have previous history of VTE. Patient did not receive any medication at the time of development of DVT that is known to reduce the efficacy of apixaban. In the setting of possible anticoagulation failure, decision to switch to a different agent can be difficult especially in cases of NOACs, since dosing is not based on laboratory measurements that would confirm the adequate anticoagulation. There is no definite data suggesting the switching of one NOAC to another and we decided to opt for a more conventional agent like warfarin with a readily available monitoring tool for plasma drug level.Cases of treatment failure with NOACs are concerning for patient safety and emphasize the need for more reliable assays reflecting NOAC activity since the standard assays of anticoagulation are generally insufficient. In this scenario, conventional agent like warfarin with accurate monitoring tools for serum drug level can be a suitable alternative.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Pulmonary Hemorrhage following Edge-to-Edge Mitral Valve Repair
1Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH,  USA2Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Mirna B.

While the procedure is not known to cause pulmonary complications, we describe two cases of pulmonary hemorrhage following percutaneous mitral valve repair. The patients did well with supportive care and reinitiation of anticlotting agents was well tolerated after resolution of bleeding. Percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (MVR) with the MitraClip device has emerged as an effective treatment option for patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) who are at prohibitive risk for surgery. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia with transesophageal echo guidance. Procedural success, described as a reduction in MR severity to grade 2+ or less, results in improvements in cardiac output and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class [1]. These findings are accompanied by a reduction in left ventricle preload, represented by a significant reduction in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure [1, 2]. Most patients undergoing percutaneous MVR are extubated immediately after the procedure and have no significant pulmonary sequelae. Here we describe two cases of percutaneous MVR immediately followed by pulmonary bleeding in the left lung confirmed by bronchoscopy.The first case is a 55-year-old female with history of asthma, hypertension, end stage renal disease secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on hemodialysis, heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (EF), and severe MR who underwent successful elective mitral valve (MV) clipping with reduction in MR from 4+ to 2+. She developed bloody frothy secretions from the endotracheal tube after procedure. Hemoglobin after procedure was 3 g/dl lower than baseline which was attributed to right thigh hematoma at the vascular access. She was extubated and continued to have mild hemoptysis. CT chest was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE) and showed ground glass opacities (GGO) predominantly in the left lung (Figure 1). Bronchoscopy revealed bleeding coming from the left lung with positive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage (PAH) in the lingula. Hemoptysis resolved upon discontinuation of aspirin and clopidogrel. Dual antiplatelet therapy was restarted few days after hemoptysis resolution without evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage recurrence.The second case is an 83-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillations s/p ablation, HF with reduced EF, and severe MR who underwent successful elective MV clipping procedure with trace residual MR. The procedure was followed by hypotension requiring epinephrine drip and a large amount of blood was noted coming from the endotracheal tube. Bronchoscopy revealed blood in the airways left more than right (Figure 2), a large blood clot in the left main bronchus, a bleeding source likely left lower lobe (LLL), and negative BAL for PAH in the right middle lobe (RML). Hemoglobin dropped by 2 g/dl. CT chest angiography was negative for PE and showed bilateral lower lobes GGO present on previous imaging consistent with HF (Figure 3). Pressors were weaned off with volume resuscitation and the patient was successfully extubated with no further pulmonary bleeding. He was initially maintained on low dose aspirin. Clopidogrel and warfarin were added few days later and clopidogrel was discontinued when anticoagulation was therapeutic.To our knowledge, these are the first cases to describe pulmonary hemorrhage immediately following percutaneous MVR. In both cases, upper and larger lower airway sources of bleeding were excluded by visual inspection during bronchoscopy and PE was excluded by CT chest. In the first case, PAH was confirmed by increasing blood on three sequential lavage aliquots. Differential diagnosis includes PAH with capillaritis such as Goodpasture syndrome, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positive vasculitis, and connective tissue disorders [3]. However, there was no clinical or laboratory suspicion for acute inflammatory process. Moreover, the patient’s hemoptysis resolved without targeted treatment for capillaritis. Bland pulmonary hemorrhage can be caused by antiplatelet therapy [4] and MR [5–7]. However, it is not clear why it would manifest right after the procedure predominately in the left lung and before clopidogrel loading. The second case represents a more dramatic pulmonary hemorrhage immediately following the procedure. Bronchoscopy showed a large blood clot in the left main bronchus with no evidence of airway bleeding after clot removal. BAL was negative for PAH in the RML and there was no clinical suspicion of systemic disease causing capillaritis. Like the first case, MR/CHF and aspirin therapy can result in pulmonary hemorrhage but the onset right after the procedure and severity of unilateral lung bleeding suggest that the procedure was a causative or precipitating factor. However, pulmonary hemorrhage after percutaneous mitral valve repair has not been noted by highly experienced interventional cardiology expertise and therefore further case descriptions of any similar adverse events will be helpful in solving this dilemma. Although hypothetical with no objective confirmatory evidence, potential theories are worth mentioning that would explain pulmonary hemorrhage after percutaneous mitral valve repair.During the MitraClip procedure, a stiff wire is used to cross the interatrial septum, providing a rail over which the steerable guide catheter is advanced into the left atrium. It is common practice to create a “J” tip on soft end of this stiff wire, creating an atraumatic tip that is then advanced into a left pulmonary vein for anchoring. While there are no prior studies describing pulmonary vein complications during a MitraClip procedure (such as pulmonary vein dissection), hemoptysis has been described immediately after dilation of the left upper pulmonary vein during percutaneous pulmonary vein stenting [8]. The occurrence of immediate pulmonary hemorrhage primarily in the left lung supports a theory of acute, transient left pulmonary vein obstruction. More studies are needed to assess this more systematically.Another contributing factor may be the effect of eccentric MR jets on the pulmonary veins. Despite overall procedural success after MitraClip, an eccentric residual MR jet may remain. Quantification of the severity of MR with eccentric or multiple jets can be challenging, and the significance of these residual jets may be underappreciated. While one prior study failed to demonstrate an association between jet direction and pulmonary vein patterns [9], it is conceivable that an unrecognized, severe eccentric jet could flood one or more pulmonary veins even transiently, resulting in unilateral or unilobar pulmonary hypertension, edema, and hemorrhage. Further studies are warranted to examine whether this phenomenon exists, and whether it could have a significant impact on pulmonary hemodynamics.In conclusion, we describe two cases of pulmonary hemorrhage in the left lung immediately following percutaneous mitral valve repair. The patients did well with supportive care and reinstitution of anticlotting agents was well tolerated.Dr. Guilherme Attizzani declares that he is a Consultant for Abbott Vascular.

When Is the Optimal Timing of Surgical Intervention for Severe Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation?
1Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto,  Japan2Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto,  JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Koichi Kaikita; pj.ca.u-otomamuk@katikiakReceived 18 April 2017; Accepted 25 May 2017; Published 19 June 2017Academic Editor: Hiroaki KitaokaCopyright © 2017 Nobuhiro Nakanishi et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a serious pathology to be noted for severe right heart failure (HF) and poor prognosis; however, the conventional assessment of TR has some limitations and the optimal timing of surgical intervention remains unclear. A 79-year-old Japanese female was admitted to our hospital to undergo cardiac surgery, because edema gradually got worse despite the increase in diuretics. She had a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic HF due to severe TR and had been treated with a furosemide for leg edema 4 years ago. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), transesophageal echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and cardiac pool scintigraphy demonstrated severe functional TR with tricuspid annular dilation, insufficient tricuspid valve coaptation, and reduced right ventricular ejection fraction (EF) but preserved left ventricular EF. In addition, Swan-Ganz catheter study showed normal pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Tricuspid ring annuloplasty was performed with MC3 ring. Postoperative TTE showed trivial TR, and she had no edema with normal sinus rhythm two months later. Annuloplasty to severe functional TR caused by tricuspid annular dilation due to AF dramatically improved right HF. Cardiologist should pay strict attention to the optimal timing of surgical intervention for TR.Morbidity of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases annually over the world [1]. In the management of AF, although thromboembolism is a critical problem in clinical practice, functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) which is caused by tricuspid annular dilation due to AF is also a serious complication leading to severe right heart failure (HF) because previous study showed that increasing TR severity was associated with poor prognosis, independent of biventricular systolic function and pulmonary artery pressure [2]. Surgical intervention which current guidelines recommended may improve the prognosis of patients with severe TR and right HF; however, the conventional assessment of the etiology and severity of TR has some limitations and the appropriate timing of surgery for functional TR without left-sided surgery remains unclear. Recently, transcatheter therapies for treating TR have been developed and could provide better treatment option for isolated severe TR [3–5]. Therefore the optimal timing of surgical intervention including transcatheter therapy needs to be determined urgently.A 79-year-old Japanese female with a history of AF, hypertension, chronic kidney disease [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 53.0 mL/min/1.73 m2], and deep venous thrombosis suffering from leg edema, previously diagnosed as right HF due to severe TR free of left-sided heart disease and treated with a diuretic agent furosemide 20 mg/day since 4 years ago, was referred to our institution to undergo cardiac surgery, because her renal function had gradually worsened (eGFR, 30.7 mL/min/1.73 m2) with increasing diuretics up to furosemide 40 mg/day for leg edema. On admission, jugular venous distention, extreme pretibial edema, and systolic regurgitant murmur in the third intercostal space at the left sternal border were observed during physical examination. Cardiac biomarkers were elevated [brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 129.1 pg/mL; high sensitivity troponin T, 0.0206 ng/mL] without liver function abnormality (alanine aminotransferase, 8 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 23 U/L; total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL) and anemia in the laboratory test. Table 1 shows other preoperative laboratory data. Electrocardiogram showed AF rhythm (Figure 1(a)). Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a tricuspid annular dilation (41 mm), insufficient tricuspid valve coaptation, reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (16 mm), dilated right atrium, dilated right ventricle, and cardiac output 2.4 L/min (cardiac index, 1.61 L/min/m2) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and severe TR was detected without left-sided heart disease by Doppler echocardiography (Figure 1(b)). Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography revealed tricuspid annular dilation (40.6 mm) and cusp separation without apparent leaflet tethering (Figure 1(c)). In addition, right ventricular EF was established by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and cardiac pool scintigraphy (39% and 57%, resp.) (Figure 2). However, there were no abnormalities in the structure of subvalvular and leaflets. Swan-Ganz catheter study revealed that pulmonary arterial wedge pressure was 5 mmHg, mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 8 mmHg, mean right atrial pressure was 4 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance index was 155 dynes  sec/cm5/m2, and cardiac index was 1.46 L/min/m2 measured by Fick method. EuroSCORE II was calculated as 2.76%, indicating low-to-moderate perioperative risk. On the basis of these findings and current guideline, tricuspid ring annuloplasty was planned. As the right atrium and ventricle were dilated, the tricuspid valve annulus was also dilated; however, tricuspid valve leaflets were intact. Tricuspid ring annuloplasty with MC3 ring (28 mm) was performed successfully. After the annuloplasty, her edema gradually disappeared with normal sinus rhythm (Figure 1(d)), and postoperative TTE showed trivial TR (Figure 1(e)) and increased cardiac output, 2.8 L/min (cardiac index, 1.88 L/min/m2). The plasma BNP was significantly decreased to 41.0 pg/mL at 9 months after surgery. Other postoperative laboratory data are listed in Table 1.Tricuspid valve disorders had traditionally tended to be ignored compared to left-sided valvular heart disease in spite of the association between increasing TR severity and long-term poor prognosis [2]. The major causes of TR (more than 80%) are functional (secondary) TR with right ventricular and tricuspid annular dilation due to pressure or volume overload, left-sided heart disease, or trauma, whereas primary TR is rare [6]. As in the present case, one of the causes of functional TR is AF, which often develops adverse right ventricular remodeling by altering right ventricular compliance, resulting tricuspid annular dilation, and leaflet coaptation defect [7]. In addition, previous study showed that AF caused more dilation of the tricuspid annulus than the mitral because the annular fibrous skeleton was less developed in the tricuspid than the mitral [8].Pharmacological therapy using diuretics is effective for systemic congestion in the early phases of the disease; however, such therapy does not affect prognosis. For the improvement of survival, surgical intervention should be performed with the optimal timing. It has been shown that right ventricular dysfunction is important for decision-making in surgery because perioperative adverse right ventricular function was a risk factor for poor prognosis. Kim et al. reported that right ventricular end-systolic area emerged as an independent determinant of clinical outcome after surgery in patients with isolated TR [9]. However, most patients with isolated TR in the previous study [9] had a history of left-sided valve surgery, and no study reported the prognostic impact of perioperative right ventricular function in patients with TR free of left-sided heart disease. In addition, because of complex geometry of right ventricle, right ventricular function cannot be evaluated reliably and reproducibly. In fact, the two imaging modalities (cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and cardiac pool scintigraphy) used in the present case showed quite different right ventricular EF. Therefore, further studies are warranted to clarify the prognostic impact of perioperative right ventricular function using multiple imaging modalities in patients with TR free of left-sided heart disease. Besides right ventricular function, hemoglobin level, TR jet area, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure were also predictors of mortality after surgery in the previous studies [9, 10]. The evaluation of these preoperative risk factors could be needed for improvement of clinical outcome after TR surgery.Current guideline regarding the indication for TR surgery indicated that TR surgery was recommended for patients with severe functional TR at the time of left-sided valve surgery [11]. However, the optimal timing of TR surgery for patients with isolated functional TR free of left-sided valve heart disease has not been established, as described above. In addition, if patients with severe functional TR were treated with diuretics, TR often would become mild. This transient improvement of TR grade might mislead the optimal timing for TR surgery. Although the timing when diuretics become unresponsive may be the appropriate timing when the TR surgery should be performed, more accurate indicators are needed to determine the optimal timing of surgical intervention for severe TR. In this regard, Dreyfus et al. proposed a new method for assessing functional TR using 3 parameters: TR severity, annular dilation, and mode of leaflet coaptation (extent of tethering) [7]. Based on this staging system, the present case, presenting severe TR, a tricuspid annular dilation (41 mm), and tricuspid leaflet cusp separation without tethering, was staged as category 3, indicating that the appropriate timing of surgery could improve her prognosis and quality of life free of heart failure despite the fact that conventional assessment showed right ventricular dysfunction without pulmonary artery hypertension and other organ failures except for renal dysfunction.Annuloplasty to severe functional TR caused by tricuspid annular dilation due to AF dramatically improved right HF. Recently, transcatheter therapies for tricuspid valve disorders are available. Cardiologists should revise their recognition for the assessment and optimal timing of surgical intervention for TR and need to stay aware of the indication of TR surgery even if TR is mild.This report was based on the approval for publication of the case report and any accompanying data by the Human Ethics Review Committee of Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medicine.Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying data.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Nobuhiro Nakanishi and Masanobu Ishii contributed equally to this work.

First Reported Case of Hemopericardium Related to Dabigatran Use Reversed by New Antidote Idarucizumab
1Department of Medicine, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY 11203,  USA2Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY 11203,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Steven Song; ude.etatsnwod@gnos.nevetsReceived 10 March 2017; Revised 8 May 2017; Accepted 23 May 2017; Published 14 June 2017Academic Editor: Magnus BaumhäkelCopyright © 2017 Steven Song et al.

The potential for life-threatening hemorrhagic events with the use of NOACs has been highly debated since the effectiveness of reversal agents such as idarucizumab is based primarily on pharmacologic data. It is known that cancer patients are at an increased risk of bleeding with anticoagulation, though specific studies demonstrating the risks or efficacy of NOACs in this population are lacking. We provide the first report of hemopericardium resulting in multiorgan failure related to dabigatran use that was successfully reversed by idarucizumab in a man with prostate cancer on chemotherapy.Dabigatran, the first novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) with a neutralizing reversal agent, ushered in a paradigm shift for the treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [1]. The inherent bleeding risk and the potential for life-threatening hemorrhagic events with the use of dabigatran and other NOACs have been a highly debated topic of interest. Until very recently, there was no approved antidote for these drugs, whereas reversal of warfarin toxicity can be accomplished with fresh frozen plasma or 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate [2]. Reports of atypical and unexpected hemorrhagic events in association with NOACs have surfaced, warranting the reassessment of the risk-benefit of these drugs along with the reliability of published clinical trials in different patient subsets [3, 4]. This case describes a spontaneous hemopericardium related to the use of dabigatran presenting as multiorgan failure and successful reversal by idarucizumab.An 84-year-old man with atrial fibrillation on dabigatran, and castrate resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases, was transferred to our medical center for further management of neutropenic fever and acute kidney injury. The patient stated he started feeling progressively weaker immediately after receiving his last dose of chemotherapy (enzalutamide and docetaxel) two weeks ago. The patient was compliant with his dabigatran (150 mg twice daily), last dose taken a few hours prior to presentation. Upon admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable but febrile to 101°F. Physical exam revealed significant bilateral lower extremity edema. Labs were notable for neutropenia; white blood cell count was  cells/L with an absolute neutrophil count of 400 cells/μL. Renal injury was evident with blood urea nitrogen of 53 mg/dL and creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, increased from his baseline of 14 mg/dL and 0.7 mg/dL, respectively, 10 days priorly. Serum potassium was elevated at 5.4 mEq/L. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was prolonged at 47.7 seconds. Liver enzyme tests were normal. Electrocardiogram showed rate-controlled atrial fibrillation with no acute changes. Chest X-ray showed probable infiltrates suspicious for pneumonia. Intravenous hydration was initiated and piperacillin/tazobactam administered for empiric coverage of his neutropenia and presumptive pneumonia. His home dose dabigatran was continued and he received his first dose the morning after admission.Within 24 hours, the patient was notably lethargic and oliguric. Labs demonstrated deterioration in renal function, worsening hyperkalemia, and acute elevation in transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase 635 mg/dL, alanine transaminase 383 mg/dL). Sepsis work-up was negative. Computerized tomographic imaging of the brain and abdominal ultrasound were also unrevealing. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a large pericardial effusion and decreased filling of the left ventricle and dilatation of the inferior vena cava with a decrease in inferior vena cava respiratory variation suggesting elevated right atrial pressure, indicating early cardiac tamponade (Figure 1). Computerized tomography of the chest confirmed the pericardial effusion (Figure 2). Dabigatran was immediately stopped. Cardiothoracic surgery and interventional radiology were consulted for emergent intervention, considering the patient was anticoagulated with dabigatran.Within hours, the patient became hemodynamically unstable with further deterioration in mental status. The examination was notable for prominent jugular venous distention, pulsus paradoxus, distant heart sounds, and diffuse bilateral wheezes and crackles on auscultation. Repeat labs demonstrated evidence of multiorgan failure with metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate 14 mg/dL, lactate 4.9 mg/dL) and significant deterioration in hepatic and renal function (blood urea nitrogen level 80 mg/dL, creatinine 2.9 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 826 mg/dL, and alanine transaminase 548 mg/dL). Electrocardiogram now revealed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and diffuse low voltage across all leads. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram now demonstrated cardiac tamponade. The patient was emergently transferred to the intensive care unit for cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure and subsequently started on norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. Idarucizumab was administered. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) shortly after idarucizumab administration normalized to 29.5 seconds (compared to 47.7 seconds on admission). The patient underwent successful interventional radiology guided pericardiocentesis without complication. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) the morning after pericardiocentesis remained normalized at 30.8 seconds. Initially 700 mls of grossly hemorrhagic fluid was removed, with an additional 200 mls over several days via the pericardial drain. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Red blood cell count by volume of the pericardial fluid was greater than 50% of serum, consistent with hemopericardium.The patient recovered to his baseline status over one week, with laboratory and clinical resolution of his multiorgan failure and no echocardiographic evidence of hemopericardium.NOACs pioneered a new era in revolutionizing oral anticoagulation treatment for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolic events [4, 5]. These agents have more predictable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties than warfarin and relatively lower (but not absent) potential for interactions with drugs, herbal, and dietary constituents, which has obviated the need for routine laboratory monitoring [4]. However, other considerations are important including the need for dosage adjustments in renal impairment and avoidance in severe liver impairment. Clinical trials demonstrate fewer hemorrhagic complications and drug interactions compared to warfarin, along with a more predictable steady state level in the blood [4, 6].Without the need for routine monitoring, physicians may be lulled into a false sense of security regarding NOACs’ bleeding risks. Paradoxically, the fear of bleeding with NOACs and lack of readily available reversal agents may lead to the underutilization of anticoagulation when indicated. Increased prescribing of dabigatran has been spurred by the advent of the first specific antidote idarucizumab in 2015, indicated for use in life-threatening bleeds [7, 8]. However, the evidence clearly demonstrates that patients at high risk of bleeding with traditional anticoagulation have similar high risks with NOACs [4]. Reports of atypical and severe bleeding presentations attributable to these drugs have emerged in the midst of the current fervor for NOACs [9]. Life-threatening hemopericardium is increasingly reported as a manifestation of adverse events attributed to NOACs [3, 10, 11].It is reported in literature that drugs which strongly affect P-glycoprotein, an ATP-dependent efflux transporter, can alter plasma concentrations of dabigatran, potentially potentiating adverse hemorrhagic events [11, 12]. The authors presume that the combination of previously administered docetaxel and enzalutamide in the index patient, both modulators of the P-glycoprotein system, in addition to severe renal impairment likely potentiated dabigatran’s anticoagulant effect. This resulted in the dramatic presentation of hemopericardium [12].Though monitoring of dabigatran activity is not routine, some measure of drug activity may be required in patients suspected to have high bleeding risks or in those with suspected dabigatran toxicity. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is reliably elevated, though with nonlinear pharmacokinetics with dabigatran use, and may be used as a proxy or a screening test in patients suspected to have a bleeding risk [13]. Normalization of aPTT shortly after idarucizumab administration as seen in this index case suggests idarucizumab’s effectiveness in the reversal of the anticoagulatory effects of dabigatran [14]. However, ecarin clotting time (ECT) and diluted thrombin time (dTT), tests which are not widely available, are more sensitive and accurate measures of dabigatran activity and idarucizumab effectiveness [14, 15].Consideration of patients’ comorbidities and drug interactions is crucial in anticipating lowered thresholds for life-threatening bleeds for patients on NOACs as oncology patients already have a significantly increased bleeding risk with NOACs compared to the general population [4, 12, 16]. Furthermore, in addition to basic consideration for drug interactions between the chemotherapy and the NOAC, review of nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, and bone marrow suppressive potential of the chemotherapy that may potentiate toxic levels of the NOAC is prudent. Until definitive practice patterns are established, NOACs should be cautiously used in the cancer population [12, 16]. Elevated aPTT levels, though suggestive, are not absolute in confirming supratherapeutic dabigatran levels. The authors hope this case sensitizes clinicians to utilizing and ordering ECT and dTT should there be a high suspicion for supratherapeutic dabigatran levels in patients at increased risk of bleeding to prevent life-threatening hemorrhagic events. Based on the presented clinical data, idarucizumab was effective in neutralizing dabigatran and was lifesaving in this presentation of massive hemopericardium [7, 8, 17, 18].The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Cardiac Dysrhythmias and Neurological Dysregulation: Manifestations of Profound Hypomagnesemia
1Heart & Vascular Institute, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI,  USA2Department of Medicine, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Sagger Mawri; gro.shfh@1irwamsReceived 30 January 2017; Revised 9 May 2017; Accepted 14 May 2017; Published 5 June 2017Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2017 Sagger Mawri et al.

Among its various roles, magnesium modulates calcium entry and release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and regulates ATP pumps in myocytes and neurons, thereby regulating cardiac and neuronal excitability. Therefore, deficiency of this essential mineral may result in serious cardiovascular and neurologic derangements. In this case, we present the clinical course of a 76-year-old woman who presented with marked cardiac and neurological signs and symptoms which developed as a result of severe hypomagnesemia. The patient promptly responded to magnesium replacement once the diagnosis was established. We herein discuss the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of severe hypomagnesemia and emphasize the implications of magnesium deficiency in the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Furthermore, this case highlights the importance of having high vigilance for hypomagnesemia in the appropriate clinical setting.Magnesium plays a fundamental role in many functions of the cell including nucleic acid and protein synthesis, energy utilization, maintenance of cell membrane function, and the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion [1, 2]. Magnesium participates in cellular second messenger systems and the regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone, thereby affecting blood pressure and altering peripheral vascular resistance [3, 4]. Magnesium is required for the stabilization of neuronal axons and plays a role in maintaining the threshold of axon stimulation [5]. Magnesium also exerts several important effects on the cardiac conduction system. It serves as an essential cofactor for the Na-K ATP pump, thereby helping to control sodium and potassium movement across cell membranes [6, 7]. Consequently, disruption in the function of this pump in the setting of hypomagnesemia impacts myocardial excitability and may result in cardiac arrhythmias [8]. Hypomagnesemia is common in the hospital setting [8, 9]. It is associated with various electrolyte derangements [10]. In severe cases, it could lead to profound clinical manifestations and serious consequences including death. Herein, we describe a unique case of an elderly woman presenting with severe neurological deficits and cardiac disturbances due to severe hypomagnesemia.A 76-year-old woman with history of hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, alcohol abuse, intractable diverticular bleed 5 months earlier status after subtotal colectomy, and recently diagnosed acute right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (off anticoagulation due to history of severe gastrointestinal bleeding) presented to the emergency department from a subacute rehabilitation center due to intermittent confusion for several days and new-onset shortness of breath of 1-hour duration.Due to alteration in mental status, history was predominantly obtained from the patient’s daughter who reported that her mother had been experiencing frequent loose bowel movements since her recent colectomy, diminished oral intake, and occasional nausea without vomiting. She reported that the patient had a recent hospitalization for dehydration and acute kidney injury at another hospital about a month ago. The patient had also been complaining of pain and tingling sensation in her feet and shaking of her arms that began about a week ago. The daughter noticed fluctuations in her mother’s mental status for the past week as well. There were no recent changes in the patient’s home medications which consisted of atorvastatin 10 mg daily, levothyroxine 100 mcg daily, and omeprazole 20 mg daily. The patient was not on any diuretics or laxatives prior to her hospitalization.On presentation, the patient was afebrile, normotensive, slightly tachypneic at 22/min, tachycardic at 166/min, and saturating 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed the patient to be in moderate respiratory distress. She was noted to have dry oral mucosa and skin tenting. Lung auscultation revealed clear breath sounds bilaterally without wheezing or crackles.Cardiovascular examination demonstrated tachycardia with an irregularly irregular rate with no murmurs and no jugular venous distention or pedal edema. Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with hyperactive bowel sounds. There was no suprapubic or flank tenderness. Neurological examination revealed the patient to be awake but alert and oriented to person only. There was evidence of resting tremors involving all extremities and impairing her speech. She had marked down-beating nystagmus and bilateral finger to nose dysmetria. There was hyperesthesia of her lower extremities and diminished vibration bilaterally distal to the tibial tuberosity. The remainder of her cranial nerve examination, strength, reflexes, and muscle tone were within normal range.An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained and demonstrated atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at a rate of 160/min with no PR or QT interval prolongation (Figure 1). Chest X-ray revealed no acute cardiopulmonary process. Initial laboratory studies revealed an elevated white blood cell count (14,100/μL), a low hemoglobin level (7.2 g/dL, near baseline), borderline potassium level (3.5 mmol/L), normal creatinine level with mildly reduced creatinine clearance (0.89 mg/dL, estimated GFR 80 mL/min/m2), normal glucose level, normal liver profile with low albumin level (1.9 g/dL), normal TSH level, low calcium (7.0 mg/dL) with a normal ionized calcium level (1.09 mmol/L), and unremarkable urinalysis. A 2D echocardiogram revealed preserved left ventricular function with ejection fraction of 65%, grade I diastolic dysfunction with no major valvular abnormalities, and normal atrial chamber size.The patient was given intravenous normal saline for hydration and a bolus of intravenous diltiazem for rate control. She underwent brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast which revealed chronic ischemic changes without any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction. A lumbar puncture revealed clear central spinal fluid, normal opening pressure, no elevation in cell count or protein content, and negative gram stain and microbiology testing. Given persistent neurological deficits and concern for cerebellar injury, the patient underwent brain MRI which revealed no evidence of pathologic postcontrast enhancement to suggest cerebellar infarction and only showed chronic small vessel ischemic changes. The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit for further monitoring and work-up.In the telemetry ward, repeat ECG revealed the patient to be in sinus rhythm and diltiazem was discontinued. The patient’s subsequent ECGs demonstrated various cardiac arrhythmias including sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions, sinus arrhythmias, and multifocal atrial tachycardia (Figure 2) which spontaneously resolved. The patient was not noted to have frequent ventricular ectopy or nonsustained runs of ventricular tachycardia on telemetry.Basic laboratory studies were rechecked together with an extensive panel of tests to evaluate for possible opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, and vitamin deficiencies including vitamin B12, vitamin E, and thiamine (given history of alcohol abuse). Based on signs and symptoms, the patient was then started on thiamine replacement parenterally for possible Wernicke’s encephalopathy. The patient was noted to have multiple loose bowel movements and thus stool analysis and clostridium difficile (C. Diff) stool assay were also checked.Repeat laboratory investigations approximately 12 hours later demonstrated the patient to have severe magnesium deficiency (<0.5 mg/dL; normal range: 1.8–2.3 mg/dL), lower potassium level (2.9 mmol/L), and calcium level (ionized 0.98 mmol/L). It was noted that a magnesium level had not been checked previously. Aggressive magnesium replacement was initiated with intravenous magnesium sulfate 2 g every 2 hours. Within the next 12 hours, the patient’s magnesium level improved to normal range (2.1 mg/dL). The patient’s potassium and calcium levels normalized.The patient responded remarkably well to magnesium replacement with rapid clinical improvement and by the next morning, her mental status returned to baseline and she had complete resolution of her nystagmus, tremors, and remainder of the neurological signs. No further cardiac arrhythmias were noted on telemetry and all subsequent ECGs showed normal sinus rhythm (Figure 3).Later, the patient’s pending laboratory tests revealed normal thiamine level, normal vitamin B12, vitamin E, and folate levels, and completely negative paraneoplastic work-up. She had no infectious etiology for her loose stools which were determined to be a consequence of her recent colon surgery. She had no urinary evidence of magnesium wasting state. The patient’s proton-pump inhibitor was discontinued and she was started on a histamine-2 receptor antagonist. She was discharged back to subacute rehabilitation center in stable condition on maintenance oral magnesium replacements.Magnesium is the second most common intracellular cation and is a required cofactor of over 300 enzyme systems including the Na+ - K+ - ATPase cell membrane pump found in cardiac tissue [3, 11]. Low magnesium levels decrease the activity of this pump resulting in a reduction in intracellular K+ levels, causing cell depolarization and lowering the threshold for action potential generation with prolongation of cell membrane repolarization time. This results in the increase in QTc and ultimately leads to excitability of cardiac tissue. Magnesium also acts as a physiological calcium antagonist in the myocardium with lower levels of magnesium increasing release of calcium from the L-type calcium channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum resulting in blockade. Thus, it is a beneficial treatment in Torsades de Pointes regardless of measured magnesium levels [12]. Magnesium is also required for the stabilization of neuronal axons and plays a role in activating calcium channel in neurons. In cases of hypomagnesemia, there is reduced activation of calcium channels resulting in increased cytosolic calcium concentration which reduces the threshold of axon stimulation and causes increase in the neuromuscular excitability.As with other ions, magnesium balance is a function of intake and excretion. There is no physiologic hormonal control of plasma magnesium and urinary magnesium excretion. Magnesium balance is achieved by absorption, mainly in the small bowel, and changes in urinary magnesium reabsorption in the loop of Henle and distal tubules of the kidney [13]. Hence, there are two major mechanisms of magnesium loss: gastrointestinal (GI) and urinary. There are continuous, unregulated GI secretory losses which contain magnesium; however, while such obligatory losses are generally mild, marked dietary deprivation may lead to progressive hypomagnesemia. GI losses most commonly occur with diarrhea rather than with vomiting, as the concentration of magnesium is higher in the lower GI tract secretions. Chronic disorders resulting in diarrhea, malabsorption, and steatorrhea as well as small bowel bypass surgery can lead to significant magnesium depletion. Recently, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) have come into light as a potential cause of hypomagnesemia, thought to be secondary to reduced active magnesium uptake through transient receptor potential melastatin 6 and 7 (TRPM6/7) channels present in the gut which become less active with decreased luminal pH levels [14, 15].There are various conditions that can lead to magnesium depletion from renal causes. These include primary renal magnesium wasting disorders involving dysfunctional transport systems of magnesium with potassium and calcium, nephrotoxic agents that impair magnesium reabsorption, hypercalcemia where high calcium filtered load can diminish magnesium reabsorption, volume expansion which may hinder passive magnesium transport in the extracellular fluid, alcohol due to ethanol-induced tubular dysfunction, and diuretics [15, 16]. Both loop and thiazide diuretics can inhibit net magnesium reabsorption, while the potassium-sparing diuretics may enhance magnesium transport and reduce magnesium excretion.Hypomagnesemia is common, occurring in about 20% of hospitalized patients and up to 65% of critically ill patients [8, 17]. Hypomagnesemia is generally asymptomatic. Symptoms commonly occur once the serum magnesium concentration falls below 1.2 mg/dL [13]. Symptoms occur due to neuromuscular irritability induced by hypomagnesemia and include muscular weakness, tremors, seizures, paresthesia, positive Chvostek and/or Trousseau signs, tetany, and a characteristic down-beating nystagmus [13, 18]. Such symptoms are congruent with those demonstrated by our patient with a magnesium level <0.5 mg/dL: opsoclonus, appendicular, and axial tremors, down-beating nystagmus, dysmetria, and encephalopathy.Hypomagnesemia rarely occurs in isolation. It is commonly associated with other electrolyte abnormalities including hypocalcemia and hypokalemia, which confer additional ECG changes including T-wave flattening, U-waves, and widened QRS complexes. It has generally been accepted that hypomagnesemia results in increased supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias and incidence of Torsade’s de Pointes [19]. A recent report from Tsai et al. presented a case of isolated hypomagnesemia suggesting an association with global T-wave inversions with prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval [20].In special patient populations, low magnesium concentrations have been associated with adverse outcomes. In acute ischemic heart disease, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in the first 24 hours is 2-3 times higher in patients with hypomagnesemia [21]. It has also been associated with development of atrial fibrillation in patients without underlying cardiovascular disease [22]. Such was the case with our patient who developed episodes of atrial fibrillation, sinus arrhythmia, and multifocal atrial tachycardia.Intravenous treatment is indicated in patients with cardiac disease, convulsions, other electrolyte abnormalities, and severe hypomagnesemia (Mg2+ < 1.0 mEq/dL). Magnesium sulfate formulations should be administered with 8–12 g given over the first 24 hours and 4–6 g given per day to replace body stores [23]. Rapid repletion in hemodynamically or actively seizing patients can be accomplished with 1-2 grams (8–16 mEq) over 1 minute. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 are at a higher risk for hypermagnesemia and a dose reduction of 25–50% should be given with close monitoring for signs including flushing, loss of deep tendon reflexes, hypotension, AV block, and respiratory depression.Our case demonstrates the profound clinical manifestations that may occur with severe magnesium depletion and, if left untreated, may have been fatal. Our patient’s severe hypomagnesemia was thought to most likely be due to gastrointestinal losses in the setting of frequent loose stools after colectomy. The patient’s nutritional status was also poor in the setting of her multiple hospitalizations and illnesses, as evident from severe hypoalbuminemia. The patient also had history of alcohol abuse before cessation five months before, further contributing to her poor nutritional status. In addition, the patient was taking daily proton-pump inhibitor which may have contributed to her magnesium loss. Each of the aforementioned contributing factors to magnesium loss was addressed accordingly and magnesium replacements were initiated with good success. We suspect the patient had been losing magnesium chronically, leading to onset of her neurological symptoms at the nursing facility and ultimately to her new-onset atrial fibrillation and other cardiac rhythm disturbances. Interestingly, there was no recorded prolongation of QT interval on ECGs, episodes of Torsade’s de Pointes, or ventricular ectopy recorded during the patient’s stay in the telemetry unit.This case also illustrates the cascade of events and extensive tests that were pursued in the evaluation of our patient’s marked symptomatology in the absence of an initial magnesium level in order to rule out various conditions, which happen to be in the differential diagnosis of severe hypomagnesemia. If not mistakenly forgotten during initial presentation, a serum magnesium level would have given an accurate, prompt diagnosis to explain our patient’s signs and symptoms and avoid extraneous testing. Fortunately, our patient’s diagnosis was established relatively quickly and the patient’s clinical status normalized after correction of her hypomagnesemia. Thus, it is important to maintain a high level of vigilance for hypomagnesemia in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with similar cardiac arrhythmias and neurological deficits, especially in those with a reason to have magnesium loss as with our patient.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Torsade de Pointes Induced by Hypokalemia from Imipenem and Piperacillin
Mount Sinai Hospital, Department of Cardiology, Suite L629, 1500 S. California Ave, Chicago, IL 60608,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Varun Kumar; moc.liamg@30knuravrdReceived 23 February 2017; Revised 2 April 2017; Accepted 23 April 2017; Published 30 May 2017Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2017 Varun Kumar et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Imipenem-cilastatin and piperacillin-tazobactam are two antibiotics with broad antimicrobial coverage. Besides the many well established adverse effects of these drugs, there have been few case reports of hypokalemia. Here we present an interesting case of resistant hypokalemia caused by these drugs leading to Torsades de Pointes which has never been reported in the past. Hypokalemia resolved with discontinuation of piperacillin. Torsades de Pointes (TdP) is one of the life threatening arrhythmias. It is associated with prolonged QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities are one of the common causes of prolongation of QT interval. Here we present a rare instance of imipenem-cilastatin (IC) and piperacillin-tazobactam (PT) causing hypokalemia leading to this potentially lethal ventricular tachycardia (VT).A 39-year-old female presented as a transfer from outside hospital for management of peritonitis and peritoneal abscess following colon perforation which occurred as a complication from oophorectomy and ventral hernia repair. Patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and diverting colostomy and a drain was placed for drainage of peritoneal abscess. Electrocardiogram (ECG) (Figure 1) at admission demonstrated normal QT interval and serum potassium was 5.2 mEq/L. No structural abnormalities were noted on echocardiogram.After 6 days of treatment with intravenous IC, she developed hypokalemia of 3.1 mEq/L, metabolic alkalosis, and prolongation of QT interval (QTc 533 ms). The rest of the electrolytes including magnesium and serum calcium were normal. Potassium was replaced and the antibiotic was switched to PT based on cultures after 2 days. Hypokalemia worsened to 2.9 mEq/L and continued to remain low despite replacement of potassium of 80–120 mEq/day. QTc further increased to 632 ms (Figure 2). No QT prolonging drug was administered in the previous 48 hours (see the following list). List of medications administered before the episode of Torsades de Pointes (TdP):(i)Acetaminophen(ii)Amlodipine besylate(iii)Calcium gluconate(iv)Chlorhexidine gluconate (last administered 5 days before episode of TdP)(v)Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (last administered 5 days before episode of TdP)(vi)Divalproex sodium(vii)Docusate sodium with senna(viii)Enoxaparin injection(ix)Fentanyl citrate in 0.9% NaCl (last administered 5 days before episode of TdP)(x)Furosemide injection (last administered 5 days before episode of TdP)(xi)Hydromorphone hydrochloride injection (last administered 5 days before episode of TdP)(xii)Imipenem-cilastatin (last administered 2 days before episode of TdP)(xiii)Lisinopril(xiv)Lorazepam injection (last administered 9 days before episode of TdP)(xv)Metoclopramide hydrochloride (last administered 6 days before episode of TdP)(xvi)Micafungin sodium (last administered 13 days before episode of TdP)(xvii)Midazolam hydrochloride (last administered 5 days before episode of TdP)(xviii)Morphine sulfate (last administered 10 days before episode of TdP)(xix)Olanzapine injection (last administered 4 days before episode of TdP)(xx)Pantoprazole sodium (last administered 4 days before episode of TdP)(xxi)Piperacillin-tazobactam(xxii)Potassium chloride(xxiii)Potassium phosphate(xxiv)Sertraline hydrochloride (last administered 3 days before episode of TdP)(xxv)Vancomycin hydrochloride (last administered 5 days before episode of TdP). Three episodes of self-terminating TdP were noted on telemetry, with approximately ten seconds being the longest duration (Figure 3). During these episodes, the patient experienced palpitations, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. Multiple episodes of nonsustained VT were also noted on telemetry. Intravenous magnesium was administered and potassium replenishment continued. Transtubular potassium gradient was calculated to be 6.5 indicating renal loss of potassium. Renin and aldosterone levels were normal. Repeat cultures demonstrated Enterobacter cloacae which was resistant to PT in addition to Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis. PT was switched back to IC as per recommendations by infectious disease specialist. Hypokalemia now responded to potassium replacement and improved to 4 mEq/L from 3.3 mEq/L and remained in normal range. QTc improved to 487 (Figure 4) and patient had no more events on telemetry. It has to be noted that during her entire hospitalization she did not develop diarrhea or vomiting to suspect gastrointestinal loss of potassium or acid.QT interval which is the time interval between beginning of Q wave and end of T wave represents electrical depolarization and repolarization of ventricles. The corrected QT interval (QTc) estimates the QT interval at a heart rate of 60 beats per minute which enables comparison of QT intervals at different heart rates. QTc is calculated using Bazett’s formula (QTc = QT/√RR interval). QTc of less than 430 ms in males and less than 450 ms in females are considered to be normal [1]. Prolongation of QT interval may be noted when there is a delay in myocardial repolarization secondary to ionic currents from electrolyte abnormalities. Phase 3 of myocardial repolarization is predominantly mediated through delayed outward rectifier potassium currents ( and ) which are in turn dependent on extracellular potassium concentration [2, 3]. In case of hypokalemia, there is decreased expression of these channels resulting in prolongation of repolarization [4]. This can cause early afterdepolarizations (EADs) from inward depolarizing currents through T-type calcium channels or sodium channels which appear as U waves on ECG. When these EADs reach threshold potential, they trigger premature action potential. Additionally, there could be heterogeneity of repolarization in myocardial cells especially in Purkinje cells and M cells in mid ventricular myocardium. EADs along with this dispersion of repolarization can initiate reentrant mechanism leading to ventricular tachyarrhythmias such as TdP [5, 6].TdP refers to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia where QRS complexes appear to twist around an isoelectric line in a sinusoidal pattern [7]. This potentially life threatening arrhythmia is usually short lived and self-terminating. However, when it occurs in quick successions, it can progress to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death [8, 9]. Some of the risk factors for prolongation of QT interval leading to TdP are as follows:(1)Congenital prolongation of QT interval (LQTS): Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome and Romano Ward syndrome(2)Electrolyte abnormalities: hypokalemia [10], hypomagnesemia [11], and hypocalcemia [12–14](3)Structural heart disease: congestive heart failure and early phase of myocardial ischemia [14](4)Bradycardia [15](5)Drugs:(a)Antiarrhythmic drugs: Class 1A (quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide), Class 1C (encainide, flecainide), and Class 3 (sotalol, dofetilide)(b)Psychotropic drugs: haloperidol, methadone, and lithium(c)Antibiotics: erythromycin and azithromycin(d)Anthracycline chemotherapeutic agents: doxorubicin and daunomycin(e)Antiemetic drugs: ondansetron. In the patient above, hypokalemia was the cause for prolonged QT interval with episodes of TdP. IC and PT are antibacterial agents which are structurally similar to penicillin and both have β-lactam ring. They are eliminated primarily through kidneys. Hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis are one of the rare adverse effects of these drugs. The two drugs behave as nonabsorbable anions in the renal tubules leading to electronegativity across the tubule. This results in increased delivery of sodium to distal nephron which in turn stimulates aldosterone causing absorption of sodium and secretion of potassium and hydrogen [16–18]. In the above patient, serum sodium and carbon dioxide levels increased to 151 mEq/L and 33 mEq/L, respectively, and potassium levels dropped to 2.9 mEq/L. Hypokalemia was relatively resistant to potassium replacements. Once the patient was switched from PT to IC based on culture and sensitivity, hypokalemia responded to potassium replacement and hypernatremia resolved.It is unclear if PT has higher tendency to cause hypokalemia than IC. There have been few case reports of PT causing hypokalemia [18–20]. Though there have been reports of the same with structurally similar meropenem [17], there have been no such reports with IC besides causing alkalosis [17, 21]. In our patient, mild hypokalemia and alkalosis developed first with IC. On switching to PT, hypokalemia worsened and remained resistant to replenishment along with development of hypernatremia. The battle with hypokalemia resolved once PT was switched back to IC. Patient remained alkalotic at the time of discharge to long term care facility (LTC) on IC.Though the patient had no prior history of syncopal episodes, family history of sudden cardiac death, or LQTS, there is a possibility that the patient may have had undiagnosed LQTS and hypokalemia may have unmasked this, as the QT interval was still mildly prolonged at the time of discharge even after the correction of hypokalemia. Our facility did not have the capability for genetic testing and patient was given a referral for outpatient testing. However, patient was lost to follow-up after she was discharged from LTC.Though electrolyte abnormalities causing prolonged QT interval and potentially fatal TdP are well established, physicians while treating patients with antibiotics such as IC and PT should be aware that they can cause difficult-to-treat hypokalemia with cardiac effects. The lacking of the full characterization of these drugs at the cellular model could have an enormous potential for in vitro studies.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
False Positive Transit Time Flowmetry Graft Failure in Multivessel Coronary Spasm following Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
1Cardiology Department, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cheltenham,  UK2Oxford Heart Centre, Oxford University Hospital, Oxford,  UKCorrespondence should be addressed to George Kassimis; rg.oohay@puskgReceived 23 March 2017; Accepted 8 May 2017; Published 28 May 2017Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2017 George Kassimis  and George Krasopoulos.

The VeriQ™ system is one of the currently available systems, which detects imperfections that may be corrected by graft revision. In this case report, multivessel coronary spasm (CS) post-CABG interferes with these intraoperative parameters misleading initially into false results. Cardiac surgeons should bear in mind the limit of VeriQ in distinguishing between graft failure and CS. Angiography may be considered in patients with decreased graft flow despite revision of anastomosis and vasodilatory treatment for the definitive diagnosis.Intraoperative Transit Time Flowmetry (TTFM) is currently recommended to assess graft patency during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), especially in presence of haemodynamic instability or inability to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass, new regional wall motion abnormalities, or significant ventricular arrhythmias. TTFM is effective in detecting imperfections that may be corrected by graft revision. This may reduce the incidence of graft occlusion and may reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality [1].The VeriQ system (MediStim ASA) is one of the currently available systems, which uses specially designed probes, which deliver a bidirectional ultrasound beam across a target vessel, and the system analyses the returning signal to calculate the blood flow through the vessel at a default filter setting of 20 Hz. A real-time flow waveform is displayed, together with the mean graft flow (MGF) in ml/min and derived values such as pulsatility index (PI). This information can be used to determine whether flow through the graft and its anastomoses is acceptable or not. MGF ≤ 20 ml/minute and/or a pulsatility index ≥ 5 predict technically inadequate grafts that need immediate revision before leaving the operating theatre. Coronary spasm post-CABG can potentially interfere with these intraoperative parameters misleading into false results [2].A 71-year-old diabetic man was admitted to the Oxford Heart Centre within 48 hours from an episode of angina at rest. Coronary angiogram demonstrated severe left main stem stenosis and three vessels coronary artery disease, with a preserved left ventricular systolic function. The patient underwent off-pump CABG using skeletonized left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the LAD and long saphenous vein (LSV) grafts to the OM and PDA arteries. After completion of the all three grafts, there was excellent flow in the arterial but not in the vein grafts. TTFM measurements with a mean arterial pressure of 80 mmHg were as follows: LIMA to LAD: MGF 83 ml/min and PI 1.4; LSV to OM: MGF 8 ml/min and PI 5.1; LSV to PDA: MGF 9 ml/min and PI 4.4 (Figures 1(a)–1(c)).At the end of the procedure the patient developed significant ECG ST depression. The sternotomy was reopened and all grafts were revised. LIMA to LAD was found to be widely patent but both vein grafts had minimal flow with no distal run-off. The patient’s conditions were stabilised with the use of inotropes and intra-arterial balloon pump (IABP). An urgent angiography confirmed the patency of all three grafts with wide spread evidence of spasm to native coronary arteries (Figures 1(d)–1(i)).The patient was started on glycerine trinitrate infusion; the adrenaline and noradrenaline were weaned successfully with complete ST resolution and he was discharged home on the 8th postoperative day with fully controlled diabetes and on 10 mg of isosorbide mononitrate, once daily, as a secondary prevention of coronary spasm for 3 months.The intraoperative assessment of graft flow with TTFM and Doppler techniques has been largely accepted and is recognized by 2014 ESC-EACTS guidelines on myocardial revascularization. TTFM is a useful tool towards the right assessment of graft patency and flow but in rare occasions can be misleading and it may fail to detect the real cause of poor flow through the grafts. Furthermore, interpretation can be challenging in sequential grafts and T-grafts [3–7].The assessment of the graft patency using VeriQ during coronary spasm can be misleading and can provide, as in our case, false positive results, which if not promptly identified can be the cause of increased mortality and morbidity.Perioperative CS is a potentially, life-threatening condition, which if not early detected and successfully treated can be catastrophic. Its prevalence during CABG is reported to range from 0.8 to 1.3% and has been documented in patients undergoing on- and off-pump CABG. Main risk factors for CS are smoking, hyperlipidaemia, advanced age, diabetes, chronic renal impairment and factors related to anaesthesia such as insufficient general anaesthesia, stimulation of the vagal nerve, hyperventilation, hypoxia, and use of large doses of catecholamines [8].The case described here represents also an extraordinary example of how, despite a generalized CS, the LIMA graft was somehow protected. It is well known how the particular structure of LIMA wall makes it less prone to spasm, even though not immune, compared to other arterial grafts. Endothelial integrity and its pronounced capacity of releasing nitric oxide may also play a significant role in preventing LIMA spasm. In this particular case, the LIMA was harvested in skeletonized fashion, questioning whether minimal thermic injury could effectively contribute to protecting the arterial graft against vascular spasm [9, 10].Pharmacological treatment of CS includes the administration of nitrates and calcium antagonists. Cardiovascular support devices such as IABP can also be very helpful in managing the acute phase of CS. If medical therapy and IABP are not proven to be sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may also become necessary to salvage the patient [9, 11].This case describes the occurrence of CS following off-pump CABG in a male patient with a poor controlled diabetes. TTFM measurements suggested impaired vein graft glow, but subsequent coronary angiography confirmed graft patency with significant CS.Cardiac surgeons should bear in mind the limit of VeriQ in distinguishing between graft failure and CS. Angiography may be considered in patients with decreased graft flow despite revision of anastomosis and vasodilatory treatment for the definitive diagnosis. The treatment for CS during CABG remains debated; time and vasodilators seem to be the most appropriate way of addressing this rare but dangerous clinical condition.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

Cardiac manifestation is rare in ALL, but it is very important and needs appropriate management. It usually presents as leukemic myocardial infiltration and in the presence of cardiac mass comprehensive evaluation for other etiologies is mandatory. We reported on a 6-year-old boy in remission phase of ALL and large cardiac mass in the right atrium with obscure early symptoms and signs, in whom infective endocarditis (IE) was diagnosed and appropriate medical treatment was performed. Because the mass was sustained, surgical resection was considered for the patient.Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) results in the malignant proliferation of lymphoid precursor cells of the bone marrow [1, 2] and is the most common cause of pediatric malignancy including 25% of all cancers in children [3]. It has been shown that prognosis would be dependent on the genetic characteristics of ALL, patient’s age, the white cell account, clinical status, and the function of major organs. The ALL is a systemic disease that was presented with different symptoms and signs [4]. Although cardiac manifestation is rare in ALL, it is very important and is needed for its appropriate management. The risk of infection in ALL is increased due to several factors including chronic use of indwelling venous catheters, multidrug resistant organisms, malnutrition and failure to thrive, frequent hospitalization, and chemotherapeutic agents [5]. Usually cardiac involvment in ALL manifested as leukemic myocardial infiltration and secondary hemodynamic changes including heart failure were seen due to systemic malignancy effects [6]. In the presence of cardiac mass comprehensive evaluation for other etiologies is mandatory. Intracardiac mass is very uncommon in ALL, but there are many reports of central nervous system (CNS) and testis involvement with lower prevalence in skin, bone, breast, neck, and head [7].We reported a 6-year-old boy with large cardiac mass in right atrium with obscure early symptoms and signs that infective endocarditis was diagnosed and appropriate treatment was done.A 6-year-old boy admitted in our hospital due to high grade fever, dyspnea, restlessness, and abdominal pain where in outpatient echocardiography the mass in right atrium (RA) was observed and for more evaluation he was referred to our cardiac center. His main disease was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), diagnosed one year ago after lower limb fracture accident that was refractory to conventional orthopedic therapy. The ALL was in the remission phase with seven courses of previous chemotropic. The history of central venous line insertion was detected. Parents mentioned that their child did not have any other disease in the past. His vital signs include the following: blood pressure, 120/85; pulse rate, 130; respiratory rate, 36; temperature, 38.5. On physical exam patient was pale and undernourished and had shortness of breath, tachypnea, and respiratory distress. On cardiac auscultation the S1 and S2 sounds were loud and grade 4/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border was heard. The liver was palpated four centimeters below rib. Both knees were swollen with tenderness. There was no significant skin lesion.Chest X-ray indicated cardiomegaly and suspicious to pleural effusion in both lungs. Abnormal ECG finding include the following: tall P wave and nonspecific ST-T changes. The laboratory results were the following: Hgb = 8.4 g/dl, WBC = 9300 cells/mm3 (Neut: 86.9%, lymph: 5.6%, and mixed: 7.5%), PLT count = 154000, and ESR > 120 mm. During two weeks the WBC increased to 20810 cells/mm3, Hgb = 10.8, and PLT count = 155000. Echocardiography finding includes the following: mild right and left ventricle enlargement, mild tricuspid valve regurgitation, mild mitral valve regurgitation, LV ejection fraction = 50%, and RA mass of 2.5 and 3 cm, mobile and attached to tricuspid leaflet in lower border (Figure 1). The CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of RA mass with sizes 34 and 30 mm; also thromboembolism (PTE) in the right lung and small segment of left lung with bilateral pleural effusion was reported. Perfusion lung scan also indicated PTE in lungs. The blood culture was negative for Bactria and fungi after 48 and 72 hours and one week and all other sampling during hospitalization.The diagnosis of infectious endocarditis was considered for child and experimental antimicrobial therapy with vancomycin and meropenem began. Anticoagulant therapy with enoxaparin was started for control of pulmonary thromboemboli (PTE). Rheumatologic consult was done for arthritis and crystalopathy was diagnosed.Despite antimicrobial therapy the high grade fever continued (>38.5°C) and antifungal treatment with amphotericin added to drug regimen. Serial echocardiography was done but there was no significant decrease in RA mass size. Because response to medical treatment after two weeks was not curative, the surgical mass resection was planned for patient. During the operation after the midsternotomy, the pericardium was thickened and there was adhision to the heart (Figure 2). On cardiopulmonary by-pass and on pump beating heart, after opening RA, there was a lesion in  cm (Figure 2) attached to anterior tricuspid valve (Figure 3). The mass was shaved completely from tricuspid valve and another mass was found near entrance of superior vena cava to right atrium that was resected completely (Figure 4). After surgery pathologic findings showed fibrinoleukocytic exudation with numerous collections resembling gram-positive cocci.After cardiac operation gradually the general condition improved, fever subsided, and in serial echocardiography there was not any cardiac mass.Because of nonspecific symptom and sign of infective endocarditis that may overlap with other clinical features in patients with ALL and irreparable burden of late diagnosis and treatment on the final prognosis, exact evaluation for on-time diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) is necessary. We encounter RA mass in children with a history of fever, respiratory signs, abdominal pain, and other symptoms and signs of IE during induction chemotherapy. According to Modified Duke Criteria our patients have definitely IE [8]. The pathologic criteria were demonstrated by the presentation of gram-positive cocci and fibrinoleukocytic exudation on histologic examination. Also one major criteria (Oscillating RA mass on tricuspid valve in echocardiography) and three minor criteria include fever with temperature > 38°C, predisposing factor as ALL and major arterial emboli confirmed the clinical criteria.Although Viridans group streptococci and staphylococci are common causes of IE in all ages but in immunocompromised patients, gram-negative Bactria is the main substrate for IE [9], although other rare organisms and fungi should be considered [10–14].In our patient all blood culture that was taken according IE sampling protocol was negative. These include specific culture for fungi and anaerobic microorganisms. Two reasons were explained in patients with IE that blood culture was negative: chronic antibiotic therapy and fastidious organism that in our case seems to be due to recent antibiotic therapy [15]. Kenio et al. reported a case of 15-year-old girl with Down syndrome and ALL; in this patient, source of IE was in the atrium and ventricle and IE was methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [16].Unlike fungal endocarditis, gram-positive cocci endocarditis in ALL was reported rarely specially when represented with isolated endocardial RA mass. When the patient does not respond to appropriate medical treatment especially when cardiac vegetation is large, surgical intervention for definite cure is necessary. With regard to the seven courses of chemotherapy in patient and history of central venous catheter (CVC) insertion it seems that indwelling catheter is the source of this event.In the study of Son et al. in patient with ALL, the IE pathogen was S. aureus but without CVC insertion [17]. ALL rarely involves the cardiac chamber; as a result any intracardiac mass in patient with ALL should be considered infective endocarditis.Schett et al. [10] reported a 60-year-old woman with endocarditis caused by Aspergillus terreus, aortic embolization, and splenic infarction. Despite chemotherapy, antibiotic treatment, and cardiac surgery for excision of cardiac vegetation she died because of multiple aortic septic emboli and multiple organ failure.In conclusion, we recommend performing an exact evaluation for diagnosis of cardiac vegetation in all children with ALL that presented with unexplained fever and other nonspecific signs suspicious of infectious endocarditis, and if the appropriate medical treatment did not elicit response, surgical intervention should be planned as soon as possible. Rational use of antimicrobial agents, prevention of long term inserted indwelling catheter, and continuous monitoring could help to decrease incidence of infectious endocarditis.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
A Rare Case of Pneumopericardium in the Setting of Tuberculous Constrictive Pericarditis

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 28-year-old Filipino male was admitted due to high-grade fevers and dyspnea on a background of chronic cough and weight loss. Due to clinical and echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade, emergency pericardiocentesis was performed on his first hospital day. Five days after, chest radiographs showed new pockets of radiolucency within the cardiac shadow, indicative of pneumopericardium. On repeat echo, air microbubbles admixed with loculated effusion were visualized in the anterior pericardial space. Constrictive physiology was also supported by a thickened pericardium, septal bounce, exaggerated respiratory variation in AV valve inflow, and IVC plethora. A chest CT scan confirmed the presence of an air-fluid level within the pericardial sac. The patient was started on a quadruple antituberculosis regimen and IV piperacillin-tazobactam to cover for superimposed acute bacterial pericarditis. Pericardiectomy was performed as definitive management, with stripped pericardium measuring 5–7 mm thick and caseous material extracted from the pericardial sac. Histopathology was consistent with tuberculosis. This report highlights pneumopericardium as a rare complication of pericardiocentesis. We focused on the utility of echocardiography for diagnosing and monitoring this condition on a background of tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, ultimately convincing us that pericardiectomy was necessary, instead of the usual conservative measures for pneumopericardium.Pneumopericardium is defined as the presence of an air-fluid level in the pericardial sac [1]. Although a rare entity, it can be the consequence of several procedures and conditions, some of which are iatrogenic (pericardiocentesis, open-heart surgery, etc.) in nature. We present a unique case of pneumopericardium in the setting of tuberculous constrictive pericarditis.A 28-year-old male with no known comorbid illnesses was admitted for a one-week history of night fevers reaching up to 39°C and progressive shortness of breath. Review of systems revealed he had a chronic history of intermittent cough with whitish sputum, as well as significant weight loss (10 kg) over the past month. One of the patient’s aunts living in their household was previously diagnosed and treated for pulmonary tuberculosis. He denied any vices.On physical exam, his blood pressure was stable at 90/60 mm Hg, but the patient was tachycardic (122 beats/minute) and tachypneic (25 breaths/minute). He had no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy, but neck veins were prominently distended. Breath sounds were decreased at the left base with crackles. The precordium was adynamic with no note of any heaves or thrills. Heart sounds were regular in rhythm and sounded distant. There were no appreciated murmurs, friction rubs, or pericardial knocks. Abdomen was flat and soft with no signs of hepatomegaly or ascites. No pedal edema was noted. Pulsus paradoxus was appreciated with a difference of 12 mm Hg between systolic blood pressure measurements during inspiration and expiration.The 12-lead ECG demonstrated classic signs of pericarditis (Figure 1) and the chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly with normal pulmonary vascularity (Figure 2(a)). A focused bedside echocardiogram showed a massive circumferential pericardial effusion with right atrial and right ventricular collapse during diastole. Left ventricular systolic function was preserved with adequate wall motion and an ejection fraction (EF) of 68%. Pulmonary artery pressure was also within normal limits.The patient was transferred to the ICU where bedside echo-guided subxiphoid pericardiocentesis was performed. Approximately 625 mL of grossly turbid, nonbloody yellow fluid was extracted over the course of 72 hours before the pericardial catheter was removed. Fluid examination yielded low glucose levels (20 mg/dL) with some leukocytes (2473 cells/microliter with neutrophilic predominance) and red blood cells (6680 cells/microliter). The KOH smear was negative for fungal elements, and cytologic analysis did not reveal any malignant cells. The initial Gram stain showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and in clusters, which failed to grow on standard culture media, possibly due to previous antibiotic coverage. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) diagnostic kits are not readily available in our country as of this writing, and therefore ADA level analysis was not performed. Sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears and HIV ELISA screen were negative. After pericardiocentesis, the patient’s shortness of breath improved but did not completely resolve. A chest radiograph taken after five days showed new pockets of radiolucency within the cardiac silhouette (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)).Follow-up echocardiographic studies were done to confirm the presence of pneumopericardium and check for constrictive physiology that would warrant pericardiectomy. Air microbubbles were visualized mainly in the anterior pericardial space (likely due to gravitational effects in the supine position), with a significant amount of reaccumulated pericardial fluid and frond-like structures (Figure 3). Even though diastolic collapse of the right-sided chambers was no longer observed, several indicators of constrictive physiology were demonstrated in this second study, such as marked thickening of the pericardium (Figure 3(a)), septal bounce due to interventricular independence (Figure 4), exaggerated respiratory variation in tricuspid and mitral inflow (Figure 5), and IVC plethora (Figure 6). Although pericardial thickness is better measured on cardiac CT or MRI, the other indicators provided sufficient evidence for pericardial constriction.A CT scan with contrast confirmed the diagnosis of pneumopericardium, manifesting as a clearly visible air-fluid level (Figure 7(a)). The study also revealed a left-sided pleural effusion with consolidation and atelectasis of adjacent lung segments, enlarged and confluent para-aortic and pre- and postcarinal lymph nodes, and several hypodense nonenhancing foci throughout the liver (Figure 7(b)). These findings were consistent with a pneumonic process on top of disseminated tuberculous infection involving the pericardium, liver, lymph nodes, and possibly the pleura. Importantly, there were no noted fistulous tracts between the pericardium and trachea/GI tract.The patient was started on oral quadruple combination anti-TB medications (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). Intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam was also given for fourteen days to cover for a possible bacterial superinfection on top of the tuberculous pericarditis, as well as possible nosocomial pneumonia. Since the patient already had features of constrictive physiology to begin with, we decided there would be little incremental benefit in administering corticosteroids to prevent progression of constriction, when weighed against the possible risks. Despite almost three weeks of anti-TB medications, the patient still complained of exertional dyspnea. Aware of the possibility of a repeat episode of tamponade from fluid reaccumulation, we decided to proceed with decompressive surgery.Surgical treatment consisted of pericardiectomy through a median sternotomy (Figure 8(a)). Intraoperatively, the thickness of the stripped pericardium was measured to be 5–7 mm (normal: <2 mm) [2] (Figure 8(b)). Caseous material was extracted from the pericardial sac (Figure 8(c)). Cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the pericardial sac contents were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other bacteria. However, histopathology was consistent with acute suppurative pericarditis on top of chronic granulomatous inflammation with Langhans-type giant cells and caseation necrosis, indicative of tuberculous pericarditis with superimposed bacterial pericarditis. AFB culture of the excised pericardial tissue was also positive after two weeks of incubation.Postoperative echocardiography revealed that constrictive physiology was no longer present, with preserved systolic function in both ventricles. He was discharged improved and completed the prescribed 6 months of anti-TB medications, with resolution of his symptoms and gain in weight back to preillness levels.The spectrum of etiologies for pneumopericardium is broad, including trauma, complications of procedures, fistulization from adjacent structures, barotrauma, and pericardial infections [3]. The most common cause remains to be trauma after penetrating or blunt chest injury [4].For our patient, the likely cause was iatrogenic introduction of air during the pericardiocentesis. Fistulization was ruled out through the CT scan. There have been documented reports of pericardial bacterial infections leading to pneumopericardium [5], and initially we could not rule out this possibility, hence the coverage with piperacillin-tazobactam. In retrospect, even with the negative bacterial cultures, this was a prudent decision since the histopathology report was suggestive of a bacterial superinfection.Table 1 summarizes the salient features of several published case reports on pneumopericardium. Our case shares similar characteristics with some of them, particularly Cases1 and 7. Our case is unique, however, in that the pneumopericardium occurred on a background of constrictive pericarditis from the patient’s disseminated tuberculosis infection. The constrictive features that were demonstrated and lack of improvement with medical treatment steered the patient’s management towards definitive pericardiectomy, rather than the conservative measures that are usually implemented in stable patients with normal echocardiographic hemodynamics.A retrospective study by Roque et al. [11] from the UP-Philippine General Hospital described the profile of 22 admitted patients with constrictive pericarditis over a span of two years. Tuberculosis was identified as the leading etiology in the local setting. On echocardiography, septal bounce and an exaggerated AV inflow pattern during inspiration were the most common findings (64% for both), followed by the presence of concomitant pericardial effusion (54%). The authors recommended pericardiectomy as the mainstay of treatment for this condition.Echocardiography had several vital applications in this case. Firstly, it served as a confirmatory test for the diagnosis of pneumopericardium initially detected on the chest radiograph. While CT scan may be a more accurate test for this purpose, the echocardiogram is a readily available and less costly exam, with diagnostic microbubbles that can easily be detected by an experienced sonographer.A unique advantage over CT imaging is the capability of echocardiography to monitor for signs of tamponade, a crucial consideration, since pneumopericardium can progress to tamponade [3, 7]. Equally important is the detection of constrictive parameters on echocardiography that would justify removal of the pericardial sac. The lack of tamponade physiology on the second echo exam was our basis for proceeding directly to pericardiectomy to relieve the constriction, instead of having to perform a temporizing pericardiostomy to drain the air/fluid.Lastly, postoperative echocardiography was able to demonstrate the success of pericardiectomy, with resolution of the constrictive physiology that was seen prior to surgery.We have presented a unique case of TB constrictive pericarditis complicated by iatrogenic pneumopericardium. We have demonstrated how the different modalities of echocardiography were used in diagnosis and therapeutic planning for our complex case. Instead of the typical conservative approach to such a complication, the concomitant constriction demonstrated on echo directed us towards definitive pericardiectomy. Knowledge of these complications is of paramount importance to guide the clinician in diagnosis and management.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

Since cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, beta-methyl-p--iodophenyl-pentadecanoic myocardial scintigraphy, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed no remarkable findings, we performed electron microscopic examination, which aided in diagnosing mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsy was also compatible with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes and DNA analysis also concluded it. Since muscle biopsy is less invasive for patients compared to endomyocardial biopsy, cardiologists need to consider it. The diagnosis of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy is helpful because it is a genetic condition and also for consideration of device therapy, as well as management for acute crisis.Mitochondrial disease is a heterogeneous group of multisystemic diseases due to mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. Although multimodalities aid the diagnosis, the diagnosis of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy is challenging because histological analysis is sometimes needed [1–3]. We report a case with 46-year-old man diagnosed with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy in the dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy diagnosed with muscle and endomyocardial biopsy and genetic analyses.A 46-year-old man visited an outpatient clinic complaining of appetite loss since a month ago. He was lean with short stature, weighing 31 kg, and 157 cm tall. He had been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at the age of 40 years and had sensory hearing loss and diabetes mellitus. An echocardiography one year ago showed diffuse left ventricular hypertrophy (interventricular-septal wall thickness: 12 mm, lateral wall thickness: 14 mm) with an ejection fraction of 52%. His mother had died at the age of 50 due to dilated cardiomyopathy and had a history of diabetes mellitus. His brother also suffered hearing loss. The patient was a nonsmoker with no history of hypertension. His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm and complete left bundle branch block (QRS duration: 128 ms) (Figure 1(a)). B-type natriuretic peptide was 176 pg/mL and troponin-T level was 0.18 ng/mL. Echocardiography revealed severely compromised global left ventricular systolic function, except the lateral wall, with an ejection fraction of 20% (Figures 1(b) and 1(c), Online video supplement 1, Supplementary Material available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/9473917). Serum lactate and pyruvate levels and cerebrospinal fluid lactate and pyruvate levels were elevated (24.4, 1.2, and 41.8, 1.4 mg/dL, resp.). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no late gadolinium enhancement (LGE); positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT) showed no remarkable findings (Figures 1(d) and 1(e)). Beta-methyl-p--iodophenyl-pentadecanoic (-BMIPP) myocardial scintigraphy revealed diffuse reduced uptake, except on the lateral wall (Figure 1(f)). Coronary angiography showed intact arteries. Endomyocardial biopsy revealed vacuolar changes in the myocardial cells (especially around nucleus) and perimysial fibrosis without inflammatory cells (Figure 2(a)). Electron microscopic examination showed increased numbers of mitochondria with various types of deformations, differences in size, and rare fraction of myofibril (Figure 2(b)). Since the patient was quite lean, we performed a muscle biopsy, which revealed ragged red fibers without cytochrome c oxidase activity, which is compatible with mitochondrial myopathy (Figures 2(c)–2(e)). Finally, mitochondrial DNA analysis of his blood sample showed m.3243A>G mutation and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. However, he denied any symptoms such as weakness and his MRI of the head did not show any remarkable findings.The diagnosis was concluded as mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and MELAS. After treatment with intravenous dobutamine for reduced output, he was given angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, beta-blocker, spironolactone, coenzyme Q10, and carnitine. Since he complained of nausea after dobutamine therapy, we performed a gastroscopy and stomach biopsy. Electron microscopic examination showed no mitochondrial deformation (Figure 2(f)). At 7 months’ follow-up after medical therapy, echocardiography revealed no change in systolic dysfunction and he had mild dyspnea on exertion (New York Heart Association, Class II). Troponin-T level remained elevated (0.18 ng/mL). He was then referred to another institute for the possibility of cardiac resynchronization and intracardiac defibrillation device therapy.We report a case, diagnosed with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy in the dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Although 30% of cases of mitochondrial myopathy showed LGE, the MRI in our case revealed no significant findings in contrast to a previous study [2]. PET-CT in our case showed unremarkable findings as well. There is no published report of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and PET-CT. Moreover, -BMIPP myocardial scintigraphy revealed diffuse reduced uptake except in the lateral wall and fatty acid metabolism disturbances, but it was indefinite because another study insisted -BMIPP hyperaccumulation is related to mitochondrial cardiomyopathy [3]. If we performed myocardial perfusion imaging, we would observe a metabolic-perfusion mismatch because of the intact coronary arteries. Since multimodal investigations revealed no conclusive findings, we performed electron microscopic examination, which aided in diagnosing mitochondrial cardiomyopathy [4]. Muscle biopsy was also compatible with MELAS and DNA analysis concluded MELAS. Since muscle biopsy is less invasive for patients compared to endomyocardial biopsy [5], cardiologists need to consider it. The diagnosis of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy as seen in our case is helpful because it is a genetic condition and also for consideration of device therapy, as well as management for acute crisis [6]. In our case, we could expect the response to CRT-D to decrease the risk of cardiac sudden death and heart failure symptoms, although cardiac MRI scan showed no LGE, which might suggest favorable outcomes [6–8].We report a case of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy presenting as dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy diagnosed with muscle and endomyocardial biopsy and genetic analyses. Since muscle biopsy is less invasive for patients compared to endomyocardial biopsy, cardiologists need to consider it regardless of muscle weakness.The authors report no conflicts of interest.
Aneurysm of the Pulmonary Artery in Fallot’s Tetralogy

Pulmonary artery aneurysms are a rare entity. Etiologies of these findings are multiple, but they are exceptionally associated with Fallot’s Tetralogy. In this study, we present an unusual case of an important aneurysm of the left pulmonary artery associated with Fallot’s Tetralogy disease. Case Presentation. A 30-year-old woman has been admitted for dyspnea and cyanosis. The data which had been obtained from echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and angio-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested the existence of an important aneurysm of the left pulmonary artery associated with a regular Fallot’s disease with a pulmonic stenosis. We have noticed the presence of a small restrictive patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Therefore, the patient was referred to surgical correction. Conclusion. Pulmonary artery aneurysms associated with Fallot’s Tetralogy are rarely reported. The natural history of these rare arterial aneurysms has to be clarified.Aneurysms of the pulmonary artery (PAA) are rarely reported in the literature [1]. Predisposing conditions include congenital and acquired heart disease, such as left-to-right shunting or pulmonary valve stenosis with poststenotic dilatation. Other causes include infections (tuberculosis, syphilis, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia), systemic vascularities (Hughes-Stovin’s disease, Behcet’s disease), collagen vascular diseases, connective tissue disorders, inherited disorders (Marfan’s syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), trauma (direct or blunt chest injury), mucoid vasculopathic changes, and idiopathic PAA. The diagnosis of these entities has been improved by the imaging methods such as echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Natural history of PAAs remains largely unknown and, up to now, guideline recommendations are not established for the optimal treatment.We report a 30-year-old female patient recently diagnosed with PAA associated with Fallot’s Tetralogy disease. She has been admitted to our clinic with the complaints of dyspnea and cyanosis. She has no infection medical history or trauma. A written consent form was obtained from the patient before the action; in addition the present study was approved by the Ibn Sina Ethical Committee after a thorough analysis. Clinical examination has revealed a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur on the left sternal border. There is no evidence of heart failure. Chest X-ray has shown a mild increased cardiothoracic ratio with coeur-en-sabot appearance associated with an unusual enlargement of the middle left cardiac border (Figure 1). Also, the electrocardiogram has exposed a right ventricular hypertrophy and a right auricular hypertrophy (Figure 2).Transthoracic echocardiography examination has revealed a congenital heart disease with characteristics of Fallot’s Tetralogy including perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defect, an overriding aorta, left and right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary valvular stenosis (mean gradient = 64 mmHg), without pulmonary regurgitation. In addition, dilatation of the left pulmonary artery has also been detected suggesting a poststenotic impact on the pulmonary artery. Cardiac catheterization has been performed. The hemodynamic results have made known the classic similar systolic pressure of the ventricular chambers and the aorta. The pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was 27 mmHg and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 17 mmHg (normal < 25 mmHg) [2].Pulmonary arterial angiography indicated a disharmonious pulmonary tree with a marked dilation of left pulmonary artery (dimensions = 47/65 mm) (Figure 3). There was a valvular obstacle with no pulmonary regurgitation. We have noticed the presence of a small restrictive PDA (Figure 4).An angio-MRI was also performed. It showed a Fallot’s Tetralogy with a dilated right ventricle associated with an aneurysm of the left pulmonary artery (Figures 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c)). Patient was referred to surgical correction.Pulmonary artery aneurysm is a rare disease. About half of the cases are associated with congenital heart diseases, such as patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defects, and ventricular septal defects that cause volume and pressure overloading in the right cardiac cavities [3]. This pathology can also occur due to inflammatory changes in the artery walls resulting from mycosis and syphilis, Behcet’s disease, and trauma [4, 5]. Isolated aneurysms may be existing with no known pathologies, but they are a very rare entity.PAAs are seen in most cases (66%) with a pulmonary arterial hypertension [1], regardless of the underlying cause. They are mostly asymptomatic. Symptoms are especially related to complications: bronchial or tracheal compression, dissection, rupture, or thrombus (caused by reduced blood flow velocity). The aneurysm can be discovered incidentally on chest radiography for unexplained dyspnea [6].Pulmonary arterial angiography is the gold standard test in diagnosis of PAA. Other recent technical modalities can also be used for optimal imaging in the workup such as echocardiography, MRI, and spiral CT which can demonstrate the patent lumen and detect any mural thrombus or other abnormalities of the vessel wall [1, 7].PAAs in Fallot’s Tetralogy are rarely reported. Only three cases are found in the literature [8–10]. Fallot’s disease usually gives a small and harmonious pulmonary tree. Echocardiographic findings and data that are obtained from cardiac catheterization and angio-MRI in the present case have suggested the existence of an important aneurysm of the left pulmonary artery associated with a regular Fallot’s disease with a pulmonic stenosis. The patient has no agenesis of pulmonic valve.A hypothesis of having a mycotic aneurysm which has developed secondary to bacterial endarteritis superimposed upon a patent ductus arteriosus is also probable. But no proof has been found. It should be noted that the association of Fallot’s Tetralogy to a PDA is exceptional.The etiologies of pulmonary artery aneurysms are multiple. But these entities are rarely associated with Fallot’s Tetralogy, as far as the present case is concerned. Some hypotheses have been discussed, but the natural history of these rare arterial aneurysms has to be clarified.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.The authors thank anyone who contributed towards the study by making substantial contributions to conception, design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data and who was involved in drafting the manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content.
Saphenovenous Graft Aneurysm: A Rare Complication of CABG
Royal Adelaide Hospital, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000,  AustraliaCorrespondence should be addressed to James Thomas Connell; ua.vog.as.htlaeh@llennoc.semajReceived 18 February 2017; Accepted 2 April 2017; Published 18 May 2017Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2017 James Thomas Connell. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Saphenovenous graft aneurysm is a rare complication of coronary artery bypass grafts that is likely underdiagnosed. It is typically asymptomatic, slow growing, and often diagnosed incidentally on angiography or following catastrophic rupture. There is no consensus on best management but PCI and surgery appear to have more favourable mortality outcomes relative to conservative management. We present the case of a 48-year-old male with a cardiovascular risk profile hallmarked by diabetes mellitus, end stage renal failure, recalcitrant hyperlipidaemia, and IHD previously treated with CABG. 11 years following his CABG, he was retrieved from remote Australia to a tertiary cardiology centre with stabbing chest pain. Serial cardiac enzymes were negative. Echocardiogram identified a mass compressing the right ventricular wall. Noncontrast coronary angiogram ultimately identified a large aneurysm at the proximal end of SVG to PDA. He was managed with aggressive risk factor modification prior to planned surgical intervention once medically optimized. His case supports the role of aggressive medical management combined with surgical intervention.Clinical Presentation. We present the case of a 48-year-old male from remote Australia. He reported a history of subacute onset, sharp, central chest pain, stabbing in nature. It was different in character to his previous angina and persisted for hours. He described no associated dyspnoea, palpitations, or diaphoresis.His cardiovascular profile was hallmarked by insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, end stage renal failure secondary to diabetic nephropathy, recalcitrant hyperlipidaemia, previous cigarette smoking and alcohol intake, and previous coronary artery bypass in 2003. At that time he underwent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft to his left anterior descending artery (LAD) and saphenous vein graft (SVG) to his posterior descending artery (PDA). The patient also had a strong family history of ischaemic heart disease, hyperlipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and renal failure.Investigations. Our patient had negative serial cardiac enzymes. ECG showed subtle anterolateral T wave inversion. He underwent an echocardiogram with an unanticipated and initially difficult to interpret finding. There was a 4.5 × 5 cm mass intimate and compressing the right ventricular wall. In the context of his ESRF, a noncontrast CT was undertaken to further quantify the lesion. This was suggestive of a large vascular structure with calcified walls, in keeping with an aneurysm. The origin of the vascular structure was indeterminate and the patient ultimately underwent a coronary angiogram (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). A mid segment left circumflex (LCX) lesion was successfully stented with a drug eluting stent. LIMA to LAD was found to be patent. Angiography of his SVG to PDA identified a unique finding. There was a diffusely ectatic large aneurysm at the proximal end of his SVG to PDA (Figures 1(a), 1(b), and 2).Management/Follow-Up. His case was discussed at a combined cardiology and cardiothoracic multidisciplinary meeting. The consensus was to pursue conservative management in the first instance and consider surgical intervention at a later date when medical management had been optimized. Aggressive risk factor modification was undertaken, particularly with regard to controlling his recalcitrant hyperlipidaemia. He remained under the surveillance of the cardiology department. After 18 months he returned for elective surgical intervention by ligation with bypass. His procedure was completed without complication and he recovered in cardiothoracic intensive care unit. He was discharged after 5 days and remains well at 6 months.In 2012, Ramirez et al. undertook a literature review analyzing all published cases of saphenous vein graft aneurysms since the first documented case in 1975. There were 168 publications comprising small case series and single case studies. There were 209 cases of SVG aneurysms included in the literature review [1]. One single centre retrospective study estimated incidence to be 0.07% based on 4 SVG aneurysms in a cohort of over 5500 cases of CABG that underwent surveillance over decades [2]. Whilst reported cases are extremely rare, their incidence is likely understated due to(i)typically asymptomatic clinical course,(ii)incidental findings on imaging or angiogram,(iii)no current screening guidelines,(iv)the potential for them to be missed on angiography if the lesion contains significant thrombus burden,(v)the fact that first presentation may be sudden death from rupture.Ramirez et al. found that they not only are rare but also are typically a late complication. 90% of cases are found greater than 5 years after bypass surgery with the mean time of diagnosis being 13.2 years after grafting [1].There were 9 publications that reported surveillance on aneurysm size. All 9 had a common finding of aneurismal growth over time [1]. The relationship between aneurysm size and rates of complication demonstrated a positive correlation between SVG aneurysm size and incidence of adverse outcomes. As aneurysm diameter approached 10 mm, adverse events increased proportionally. All-cause mortality within 30 days of diagnosis was reported at 13.9% [1].The most commonly observed treatment option has been surgery; however PCI has become increasingly popular over the past decade. Surgery has been advocated whenever compressive complications are present, when there is compromised myocardium that would benefit from bypass, and when the candidate is fit enough for an operation [3, 4]. The surgical techniques used have been aneurismal ligation or aneurismal resection plus/minus bypass revascularization [1, 3].Conservative management has been reported in 20% of patients. The approach has been secondary prevention, risk factor modification, and surveillance [5]. Mortality rates were higher in the conservative management specific cohort.PCI has been a popular modality with more favourable mortality rates. It has been the least trialed treatment pathway with 32 published cases. Coiled embolization, septal occlusion, and stenting have all been employed [1, 3, 6].Ramirez et al. concluded that surgery and PCI were viable treatment options for SVG aneurysms. The high rates of complications in even small aneurysms meant surveillance or conservative management was less appropriate [2]. They conceded that the number of small, stable aneurysms may be underdiagnosed and therefore complications and mortality incidence may be overrepresented in the conservative cohort [1, 7].Our case provides an example of a unique and underdiagnosed complication of CABG. The optimal management of SVG graft aneurysm has not yet been established, but there appears to be benefit from a combination medical and surgical intervention. Our patient was a high-risk surgical candidate who was relatively asymptomatic. By careful risk stratification we determined that aggressive medical management of his comorbidities was appropriate prior to ultimately proceeding to definitive surgical intervention.There are no conflicts of any relationship with industry to disclose.

Type A Quadricuspid Aortic Valve Infective Endocarditis Complicated by Multiple Aortocardiac Fistulae: Case Report and Brief Literature Review
1Mohammed VI University Hospital, Oujda University, BP 4806, 60049 Oujda,  Morocco2Department of Cardiology, Mohammed VI University Hospital, 60049 Oujda,  MoroccoCorrespondence should be addressed to Amine Ghalem; moc.liamg@4102idmahmmiharbReceived 17 March 2017; Accepted 3 May 2017; Published 18 May 2017Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2017 Amine Ghalem et al.

In infective endocarditis setting, their presence should prompt urgent surgery as patients can deteriorate rapidly. We report the case of a 78-year-old female patient with the first ever reported quadricuspid aortic valve infective endocarditis complicated by multiple aortocardiac fistulae. Additionally, we provide a brief review of ACF, in infective endocarditis and quadricuspid aortic valve.Aortocardiac fistulae are exceptionally due to infective endocarditis; they are usually congenital, posttraumatic, or complicate aortic dissection [1, 2]. In infective endocarditis setting, the rare presence of aortocardiac fistulae mandates urgent surgery given their poor prognosis [3].Our case describes a 78-year-old female patient with the first ever reported, to the best of our knowledge, quadricuspid aortic valve infective endocarditis complicated by multiple aortocardiac fistulae.A 78-year-old female with a history of severe mitral stenosis and mild aortic stenosis with subsequent mechanical mitral valve replacement in 2001 and a cholecystectomy in 2015 presented to our hospital with prolonged fever, exertional dyspnea, and orthopnea. Upon presentation, vitals were as follows: oral temperature of 38.3°C, blood pressure of 120/78 mmHg, heart rate of 105 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient was alert and oriented. Physical examination revealed signs of acute decompensated heart failure and a grade 4/6 continuous murmur in the aortic focus with normal prosthetic heart valve sounds. ECG showed atrial fibrillation. Laboratory tests were remarkable for elevated levels of NT-proBNP, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood cell count (WBC). Chest X-ray showed signs of pulmonary edema. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal-functioning mitral prosthetic valve, type A quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV), aortic valve vegetation with aortic periannular abscess, severe aortic regurgitation (AR), and mild aortic stenosis. Furthermore, we evidenced two existing interruptions of tissue continuity between the aortic root and left atrium (LA) traversed by a turbulent flow inside revealing abscess and left sinus of Valsalva fistulization to LA (Figures 1 and 2).The patient declined to perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Serial blood cultures resulted positive for Enterococcus faecalis. Aortic valve infective endocarditis (IE) was established. The patient was started on amoxicillin, gentamicin, and intravenous furosemide. Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) displayed two pseudoaneurysms and hypodense material, suggestive of an abscess, in the aortic root (Figure 3).Cerebral computed tomography scan (CT) was normal. Abdominal CT scan delineated splenic infarct. Given the bacteria incriminated in this case of IE, we performed a colonoscopy that was unremarkable. The hospital course was favorable with the disappearance of heart failure signs and apyrexia after the first week of treatment, along with regression of biological inflammatory syndrome. At this stage, we discussed cardiac surgery with the patient and her family who preferred conservative medical management. Unfortunately, on the 28th day after admission, the patient presented brutal, severe hypotension, and severe bradycardia followed rapidly by cardiac arrest. The patient died despite our best cardiopulmonary resuscitative efforts.The etiology of aortocavitary fistulas, abnormal connections between the aorta and cardiac cavities, is diverse. They can be congenital, caused by dissecting aneurysms and aortic dissection, secondary to blunt chest trauma, and they can also be seen after cardiac surgery especially operations involving the aorta or the aortic valve. Another cause, which is exceptional, is infective endocarditis (IE) [1, 2]. In a multicenter study of 4681 episode of IE, aortocardiac fistulae were diagnosed only in 1.6% of cases [4]. From a pathophysiological perspective, aortocardiac fistulae caused by IE are due to the extension of the infection to the perivalvular structures (aortic annulus and/or the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa) with the subsequent creation of an abscess or a pseudoaneurysm that ruptures into cardiac chambers [4, 5]. The four cardiac chambers and the three sinuses of Valsalva are equally involved in the fistulous tract [4]. Our patient had quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) IE complicated by two aortocardiac fistulae involving the left atrium. QAV is a rare abnormal development of semilunar valves that has been reported in 0.008%, 0.043%, and 1% in, respectively, autopsy series, two-dimensional TTE, and in aortic valve surgery [6]. However, thanks to advances in cardiac imaging technics, more cases have been reported. It is more often than not a solitary abnormality but is associated with patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, subvalvular and supravalvular aortic stenosis with left coronary atresia, and coronary ostia obstruction in nearly 10% of the cases [7]. AR is the most frequent complication of QAV accounting for 75% of the cases, where 9% have both aortic stenosis and regurgitation (isolated aortic stenosis is very rare) and 16% have normal-functioning QAVs [6, 8].Echocardiography, especially TEE, is the preferred imaging technique for the detection of aortocardiac fistulae and QAV [4, 7]. Echocardiographic high diagnostic performance for aortocardiac fistulae is explained by the significant pressure gradient between the aorta and the cardiac chamber, which results in a highly turbulent flow across the fistulous formation readily detectable by continuous and color Doppler mapping even in the case of small fistulas [4]. In QAV, echocardiography shows an X-shaped pattern during diastole and a rhomboidal image in systole [7] (Figure 1). It is worth noting that in aortic IE, MSCT is an excellent imaging technique as it not only allows detection of abscesses/pseudoaneurysms—like in our case—with a similar diagnostic accuracy to TEE but also provides probably more information regarding the extent and consequences of any perivalvular extension, including the anatomy of pseudoaneurysms, abscesses, and fistulas. Additionally, in aortic IE, CT may help surgical planning [3].Aortocardiac fistulae bear a poor prognosis; in the study previously mentioned, over 60% of patients with aortocardiac fistulae developed significant heart failure and over 40% died [4]. Thus, urgent surgery, along with antibiotics, is the treatment of choice in most cases; although some institutions send patients to surgery after completion of antibiotherapy unless other complications arose [2, 3, 5]. The primary objectives of surgery are total removal of infected tissues, replacement of the aortic valve using a mechanical or biological prosthesis, and closing of the fistula. Regarding the choice of the prosthesis to use, expert opinion favors cryopreserved or sterilized homografts [3]. In our case, the patient and her family refused surgery.Only a few cases of EI involving QAV have been reported [9]. However, to the best of our knowledge, our case is the first to describe an association between QAV infective endocarditis and multiple aortocardiac fistulae. Also, two other findings were peculiar in our case; the first is the fact that the patient had a history of aortic stenosis without aortic regurgitation, which is very rare, the massive AR discovered by echocardiography being most likely secondary to IE. The second is the fact that our patient had type A QAV (all four cusps being of equal size) according to Hurwitz and Roberts classification, which is the variant less prone to IE because of the lack of asymmetry or flow disturbance [6]. Previously to our case, only Matsukawa and al. presented a bacterial endocarditis in a 75-year-old patient diagnosed with type A QAV [10].Few QAV infective endocarditis cases have been reported. Our report is the first one to describe a unique association between QAV IE and multiple aortocardiac fistulae, which are dangerous complications bearing frightening prognosis. Echocardiography, especially TEE, is usually the preferred imaging technic for both QAV and aortocardiac fistulae, especially in African countries where MSCT is not always available. In the setting of IE, the presence of aortocardiac fistulae prompts urgent surgical intervention as patients can deteriorate rapidly.The authors declare no conflicts of interest.All authors have participated in drafting the article and revising it critically for important intellectual content.

Anomalous Papillary Muscle Insertion Causing Dynamic Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction without Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Anomalous papillary muscle insertion directly into the surface of the mitral valve leaflet is rare, especially in a subject without apparent evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We present a case of this isolated congenital malformation producing two hemodynamic sequelae of dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and severe mitral regurgitation.Congenital malformations of the papillary muscles, including their direct insertion into the mitral valve leaflet, are uncommon and associated primarily with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Herein, we present a rare case of isolated anomalous papillary muscle insertion into the anterior mitral valve leaflet, causing both dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and severe mitral regurgitation, in a patient without clear-cut evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We discuss potential mechanisms for the hemodynamics observed and underscore the importance of recognizing this clinical entity, as it may alter the surgical treatment.A 59-year-old healthy male sought an outpatient medical evaluation following two episodes of unwitnessed syncope that had occurred two weeks prior. He described the most dramatic event occurring after waking up from sleep in the mid-morning hours to urinate, when he was found by his family lying on the ground unconscious with a minor frontal scalp contusion. He denied any symptoms prior to the fall. His medical history was unremarkable for any atherosclerotic risk factors or rheumatic fever as a child. His vital signs were normal but physical examination was notable for a 2/6 crescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and a holosystolic murmur at the apex. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no signs of left ventricular hypertrophy and normal ST segments and T waves. An event monitor did not reveal any evidence of arrhythmia.A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular (LV) cavity dimensions and ejection fraction but color Doppler revealed significant turbulence across the LV outflow tract (LVOT). Pulse-wave Doppler of the LVOT revealed a late-peaking “dagger-shaped” systolic jet with a peak velocity of 3.94 m/s and gradient of 62 mmHg that, respectively, increased to 4.56 m/s and 83 mmHg with Valsalva maneuver (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). There was moderately increased LV wall thickness with the septal wall measuring 1.4 cm. A transesophageal echocardiogram more clearly pointed out the presence of systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)), but there was also a thicker subvalvular structure attached to the ventricular surface of the anterior mitral leaflet which was noted as not typical of chordae tendineae. The anterior mitral valve leaflet appeared redundant, and color Doppler demonstrated a severe, posteriorly directed mitral regurgitant jet into a moderately enlarged left atrial cavity (Figures 1(e) and 1(f)). The trileaflet aortic valve displayed normal mobility. Right and left heart catheterizations showed normal coronary arteries and filling pressures. Using a dual lumen pigtail catheter, simultaneous aortic and LV pressures were recorded showing an 84 mmHg peak-to-peak gradient that increased to 160 mmHg with induction of premature ventricular contractions as well as strain-phase Valsalva (Figure 2(a)). A pullback tracing of the same catheter from the mid LV cavity to just beneath the aortic valve in the LVOT showed normalization of the gradient, corroborating the subvalvular level of obstruction and the lack of aortic valve involvement (Figure 2(b)).The final impression following diagnostic testing was that this subject had developed symptomatic, dynamic LVOT obstruction and asymptomatic, chronic severe mitral regurgitation, which were felt to be best treated with cardiothoracic surgery. The operation was performed via a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest. After opening the left atrium, the mitral valve leaflets appeared thickened and myxomatous, but notably, the anterolateral papillary muscle was anteriorly displaced and inserted directly into the A1 scallop of the anterior mitral leaflet with minimal chordae tendineae attachments (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Furthermore, this displaced papillary muscle seemed to extend directly across the LVOT. Surgical management consisted of excision of the abnormally positioned papillary muscle and A1 portion of the anterior mitral leaflet and replacing this with a bovine pericardial bioprosthesis. The A3 chords of the anterior mitral leaflet and all chords of the posterior leaflet were preserved. A mitral valve repair only strategy was not felt to be a viable option given concerns that this would not provide durable relief from LVOT obstruction. Histologic analysis of the mitral valve tissue revealed nodular myxoid degenerative change, and the papillary muscle was characterized by myofiber hypertrophy. An echocardiogram performed on postoperative day 3 revealed the absence of any significant LVOT turbulence and marked reduction in the transaortic gradient to 14 mmHg. After an uneventful postoperative course, the patient was discharged home alive and well on postoperative day 5. At six-month follow-up, he still reported feeling well with no recurrent syncope.Congenital malformations of the LV papillary muscles, including their direct insertion into various portions of the anterior or posterior mitral valve leaflets, are rare. Our greatest understanding of anomalous papillary muscle insertion (APMI) comes from its identification in subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The largest two case series that included a total of 23 HCM subjects with APMI established its prevalence between 4.5 and 13% [1, 2]. In addition, a few case reports have described the clinical presentation and management of APMI in the HCM population [3–8]. In subjects who do not meet classic criteria for HCM, isolated APMI has been described in only four case reports to date, each describing papillary muscle attachment to either the basal or ventricular surface of the mitral valve leaflets [6, 9–11]. In two other case reports of non-HCM subjects, this aberrancy was shown to be present alongside discrete subaortic stenosis [12, 13].To our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe APMI in a non-HCM subject leading to two hemodynamic consequences, significant dynamic LVOT obstruction causing syncope and severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR). Dynamic LVOT obstruction that is characteristic of HCM is due to a thickened LV septal wall and anterior mitral valve leaflet SAM that results in mitral-septal contact during systole. Increasingly, primary abnormalities of the mitral valve apparatus in HCM, including abnormal leaflet coaptation, leaflet elongation, chordal slack, and papillary muscle displacement, have been recognized as promoting SAM and generating obstruction [14, 15]. Even in the absence of HCM, SAM has still been shown to occur following treadmill exercise or dobutamine stress [16, 17]. In these settings, intrinsic abnormalities of the mitral apparatus were postulated to be sufficient to cause SAM, independent of significant LV septal wall hypertrophy being present. In the current case, the mechanism of SAM is presumably related to abnormal leaflet coaptation from anterior leaflet restraint induced by the APMI. Furthermore, the anterior displacement of this aberrant papillary muscle may align the anterior mitral leaflet directly within the LV ejection pathway, and so both the papillary muscle and anterior mitral leaflet are swept toward the septum, consistent with previous descriptions [16, 18].The mechanism of coexistent severe MR appears to be twofold. In HCM subjects, MR is typically posteriorly directed. In the present case, the echocardiographic appearance and histology of the mitral valve leaflets were consistent with myxoid degeneration, and so it is likely that the redundancy of the anterior mitral valve leaflet led to even more compromised coaptation surface. Secondly, the tethering effect of the hypertrophied anterior papillary muscle causing ventricular displacement of the anterior mitral leaflet may have been contributory, as described previously [19]. The role of papillary muscle contraction in exacerbating this tethering effect cannot be discounted. These factors would certainly explain the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, which was likely long-standing given the moderate left atrial enlargement observed. Interestingly, the severe mitral regurgitation appears to have been an innocent finding with no clinical symptoms or signs of previous heart failure and normal ventricular filling pressures demonstrated at the time of cardiac catheterization.For the typical HCM patient with drug-refractory symptoms, surgery with septal myectomy is the first-line therapeutic approach [20, 21]. If mitral valve abnormalities are also present, then mitral valve repair may also be required. For cases of APMI, clinical judgment prevails as there is no standardized surgical approach. A mitral valve-sparing technique described previously involves performing an extensive septal myectomy that extends from the base down to the papillary muscle with a wider trough created toward the apex. By doing so, the mid and apical LV cavity is widened thus relieving the intracavitary obstruction [8, 15]. A different method incorporates mitral valve replacement altogether with concurrent resection of the anomalous papillary muscle, which was the operative technique employed in the current case as well as in two of the previously published case reports of isolated APMI that provided operative details [9, 10]. In all instances, the result was significant reduction in LVOT obstruction. In the first published series of HCM patients with APMI, those who underwent mitral valve replacement achieved a marked reduction in LVOT gradients down to 0–15 mmHg, as opposed to those who only underwent septal myotomy/myectomy who showed persistent 60–70 mmHg gradients and continued symptomatology [1].The preoperative diagnosis of APMI can be elusive, especially if one does not have knowledge of this congenital variant. In our case, this anomaly was diagnosed by direct intraoperative visualization but only retrospectively fully characterized when reviewing preoperative echocardiographic imaging. This concern has been raised even when examining HCM subjects; as in one series, 90% of necropsy HCM specimens were retrospectively characterized by echocardiography once the diagnosis was elucidated at autopsy [1]. In another series, two-thirds of all subvalvular mitral apparatus anomalies were identified only in the intraoperative setting [2]. This current report of APMI in a non-HCM subject illustrates that invasive hemodynamics generated in the cardiac catheterization laboratory do not reliably differentiate between the various forms of dynamic LVOT obstruction. The diagnosis of APMI relies on clinical knowledge of this entity, optimal echocardiographic delineation of the mitral valve and its subvalvular apparatus, and even cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to understand the mechanisms leading to pathology. Furthermore, a strong index of suspicion is necessary especially if clear-cut HCM is not present.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Pyridostigmine Induced Prolonged Asystole in a Patient with Myasthenia Gravis Successfully Treated with Hyoscyamine

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used as first-line treatment for myasthenia gravis. They improve symptoms by increasing concentration of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and stimulating nicotinic receptors. Serious bradyarrhythmias can occur from muscarinic stimulation in heart, which in rare cases may progress to asystole. These patients can initially be managed with hyoscyamine, a muscarinic antagonist. Persistence of bradyarrhythmias even after hyoscyamine treatment may warrant pacemaker placement. We present a case of 65-year-old female patient who presented with diplopia, dysphagia, and muscle weakness who was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. She developed significant sinoatrial node block with prolonged asystole after starting treatment with pyridostigmine which was successfully treated with hyoscyamine, thus avoiding pacemaker placement.Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junctions. It is characterized by decrease in the number of available nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at postsynaptic membrane due to presence of pathogenic autoantibodies [1, 2]. Reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used as initial treatment for MG and pyridostigmine is the most widely used drug. They improve symptoms by increasing concentration of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction leading to stimulation of nicotinic receptors at postsynaptic membranes [2, 3]. However, use of these drugs is associated with potential adverse effects due to stimulation of muscarinic receptors elsewhere. In heart, this results in slowing of sinoatrial (SA) rate and atrioventricular (AV) conduction [3]. Although sinus bradycardia and hypotension are common side effects of these drugs, prolonged asystole is very rare with only one case reported so far [4].We present a case of 65-year-old female patient who presented with diplopia, dysphagia, and muscle weakness who was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. She developed significant SA node block with prolonged asystole after starting treatment with pyridostigmine.A 65-year-old African American female presented with 4-month history of intermittent dysphagia, diplopia, fatigue, and muscle weakness which was more prominent in upper extremities.Examination of cranial nerves revealed diplopia on right gaze, bilateral ptosis on sustained upward gaze, and mild lower facial muscle weakness. Motor examination showed decreased muscle strength of 4/5 in proximal and distal musculature of all extremities and neck flexors. Sensory system was intact and reflexes were normal.In view of the above clinical presentation, MG was suspected and serological workup for MG was obtained which was positive for antibodies to acetylcholine receptor (AChR) with a titer of 14.6 nanomole/liter (0.0–0.4 nanomole/liter). Once diagnosis of MG was confirmed, she was started on pharmacological treatment with oral pyridostigmine (60 mg Q8 hours) and intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (125 mg daily). Computerized Tomography (CT) of chest was done to exclude thymoma.On 2nd day of treatment patient developed bradycardia with heart rate ranging from 40 to 50/min and frequent sinus pauses lasting from 1 to 3 seconds (Figure 2). She then developed an episode of asystole lasting 16 seconds (Figure 1), which was picked up by telemetry. Patient was asleep during this period and reported no symptoms. The etiology of this prolonged asystole was attributed to high grade SA node block caused by pyridostigmine. The dose of pyridostigmine was decreased to 30 mg q8 hours orally; however, patient continued to have sinus pauses and bradycardia. Therefore, treatment with oral muscarinic antagonist hyoscyamine (0.25 mg q6 hours) was initiated, which resulted in improvement in bradycardia and sinus pauses. Patient did not have any known history of bradyarrhythmias or dysautonomia. She did not report any symptoms (postural dizziness, syncope, or transient weakness) concerning for primary or secondary autonomic dysfunction. On reviewing the medications, no other drug besides pyridostigmine that can cause severe bradycardia or asystole was found. She was on continuous telemetric monitoring for 72 hours after starting treatment with hyoscyamine and no further episodes of bradycardia or asystole were reported. At 1-month follow-up after discharge, patient did not complain of any symptoms of dizziness or syncope. An electrocardiogram done at the follow-up visit showed normal sinus rhythm.Myasthenia gravis is the most common disorder affecting the neuromuscular junctions. It is caused by antibody mediated autoimmune attack against postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [1, 2]. The estimated incidence of MG is around 20 to 30 per 1,000,000 per year with increased incidence with age in males and females [5, 6].The characteristic clinical feature includes fatigable weakness of muscles with early involvement of facial and extraocular muscles [7]. Ptosis, diplopia, dysphagia, and dysarthria are common initial presentation of MG with weakness becoming more generalized and affecting the limb muscles in majority of patients in later stage of disease [2, 7]. Diagnosis of MG is clinical and suspected cases are confirmed with testing. Demonstration of autoantibodies in presence of clinical features is diagnostic of MG. Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies are most common and occur in 85% of patients [5]; however, small proportion of patients have other antibodies such as muscle specific kinase antibodies (anti-MuSK), anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and striational antibodies (anti-muscle titin and anti-ryanodine receptor) [8]. Electrophysiological studies such as repetitive nerve stimulation and single fiber EMG are also used for confirming diagnosis of MG. Tensilon test by injection of IV edrophonium and demonstration of improvement of muscle weakness is usually reserved in patients with typical clinical features and negative serological and electrophysiological testing [2].MG is known to have cardiac involvement manifesting in different forms, ranging from asymptomatic EKG changes to fatal arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death [9, 10]. Arrhythmia is the most common clinical manifestation of cardiac involvement in MG with increased risk of sudden cardiac death.Guglin et al. [9] studied 108 patients with MG and found that 16% of these cases have signs of cardiac involvement (atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular heart blocks, asystole, and sudden death) which were attributed to autoimmune myocarditis. The prevalence of cardiac involvement is higher in patients with thymomas (50%) as compared to patients without thymomas (12%) [10].Treatment of MG is with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and immunosuppression. Plasmapheresis and IVIG treatment are used in acute myasthenia crisis to expedite recovery. Pyridostigmine, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, improves symptoms by increasing acetylcholine concentration at neuromuscular junction and stimulating nicotinic receptors [3]. However, this beneficial effect of pyridostigmine at neuromuscular junctions is accompanied by unwanted muscarinic activity in other organs which can lead to serious side effects. In heart, augmentation of vagal nerve tone causes depression of the SA and AV nodes which can lead to fatal bradyarrhythmias. Arsura et al. [11] described 12 patients of MG from a pool of more than 1000 who suffered hypotensive episodes and syncope related to use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Out of these twelve patients nine suffered from severe sinus bradycardia, junctional bradycardia, or complete AV dissociation [11]. Gehi et al. [12] in 2008 reported a case of MG who presented with syncope caused by pyridostigmine induced high grade AV block. Patient was treated with hyoscyamine resulting in reversal of AV block and thus avoiding pacemaker placement. Said et al. [4] reported first case of pyridostigmine induced high grade SA block leading to asystole for 5.9 sec in a patient with MG. The patient continued to have sinus bradycardia and pauses despite being treated with anticholinergic medications and required pacemaker placement. In our patient, the asystole due to high grade SA nodal block caused by the pyridostigmine was more prolonged and lasted for 16 sec (Figure 1). SA nodal block responded to treatment with hyoscyamine and patient did not requir pacemaker placement. To our knowledge, this is second reported case of pyridostigmine induced high grade SA node block leading to prolonged asystole.This is a case of pyridostigmine induced high grade SA block with longest reported duration of asystole. Treatment of myasthenia gravis with reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like pyridostigmine may be associated with potential side effects such as bradyarrhythmias and in rare cases complete asystole and sinus arrest. These patients can initially be managed with hyoscyamine, a muscarinic antagonist. Persistence of bradyarrhythmias even after hyoscyamine treatment may warrant pacemaker placement.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Failed TAVI in TAVI Implantation: TAVI Dislocation Followed by Ensuing Surgical Graft Resection

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We are presenting a case report of failed valve-in-valve treatment of severe aortic stenosis. A control ultrasonography after TAVI implantation revealed a severe aortic regurgitation of the graft which was subsequently unresolved with postimplantation dilatation. Second TAVI was implanted with cranial dislocation to the aortic root. Patient underwent a CT examination to clarify the TAVI in TAVI position. Patient underwent a surgical resection of TAVI with implantation of biological aortic valve prosthesis. In situations where TAVI treatment fails or is complicated beyond the possibility of endovascular repair, surgical intervention despite its higher risks is the preferred choice.Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is rapidly progressing in becoming a leading treatment for severe aortic stenosis in high-risk or inoperable patients [1]. Over the past years, we had seen an increase in the number of implanted TAVIs, as well as broadening the spectrum for their medical indications [2]. Implanting TAVI in lower risk patients is one of the major transitions that was observed in recent years [3]. Degeneration of biological valves is extensively documented with median of ten years after surgical replacement [4, 5]. Despite the possibility of a potential failure, these valves are implanted into the elderly patients [5]. On the other hand, the degeneration of TAVI has been documented very rarely [6–8]. Currently, a limited number of works are concerned with systematic reviews of TAVI failures and complications [9, 10]. Dislocation and paravalvular aortic regurgitation are two of the most common technical complications associated with TAVI which must be addressed through endovascular or by surgical means [9, 11, 12].We are presenting a case report of failed TAVI in TAVI followed by surgical resection and implantation of bioprosthetic aortic valve.77-year-old polymorbid patient with severe aortic stenosis (AVAi: 0,42 cm2/m2), New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification: Class II, was admitted into our center for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The patient’s past medical history included ischemic heart disease (implantation of Resolute Integrity 3,5 × 12 mm stent into anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery in June 2015) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) after embolization into right middle cerebral artery (MCA) in February 2014 with reoccurrence in July 2014. The reoccurred TIA after embolization into the right MCA left patient in state of poor mobility with severe neurologic deficit on the left upper and lower extremity. Further patient’s past medical history contained arterial hypertension (WHO classification: II), left parailiac lymphadenopathy of unknown origin (based on CT examination in June 2015), and burn trauma to the lower extremities with defects on the lower legs.Patients Euroscore II (8,95%) with combination of reoccurred TIA after embolization into the MCA, poor mobility with severe residual neurologic deficit, and defect on the lower legs after burn trauma made us classify patient as a “high-risk”; thus, TAVI was indicated as a suitable treatment option.Under general anaesthesia, through right common femoral artery, a CoreValve 31 mm (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was implanted in a standard manner (through a 6Fr sheath using a guiding wire Confida (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), a Nucleus 25 mm (NuMED, Canada) balloon was used to dilate the aortic valve before valve implantation). After the valve implantation was completed, an angiographic and ultrasonographic verification of the valve’s position revealed its malposition deep inside the left ventricle. This was the cause of a severe residual aortic regurgitation persisting even after redilation of the valve with NuMED 28 mm (NuMED, Canada) balloon. For this reason, a second CoreValve 31 mm (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) was implanted. After implantation, the second graft was dislocated cranially into the aortic root, again with severe residual aortic regurgitation. At the time, due to the increase of aortic diastolic pressure up to 45 mmHg a further intervention was contraindicated. Femoral artery access point was treated with two Angioseals (St. Jude Medical, Angio-Seal™).After recovery from the endovascular procedure marked by multiple complications, a computed tomography (CT) and heart ultrasonography were performed to verify the grafts’ positions and the severity of aortic regurgitation causing congestive heart failure of the patient (Figure 1). Following the CT and heart ultrasonography which confirmed a severe residual aortic regurgitation, the patient was indicated for surgical resection of both failed TAVI devices and an aortic valve replacement.The procedure was performed in general anaesthesia, accessing the heart trough complete sternotomy. After standard cannulation for extracorporeal circulation, ascending aorta was cross-clamped. Aortotomy was performed revealing the failed TAVI (Figure 2). Both TAVIs were safely resected and removed from the aortic root and the ascending aorta after they were covered by a frozen saline solution. This caused the metallic structure of TAVIs to contract, thus allowing for an easy removal of the grafts. The aortic annulus was sized after the aortic valve leaflets were resected following the CE Perimount 27 mm valve (Carpentier-Edwards Perimount Magna Ease Aortic Heart Valve) implantation in a standard manner. After aortotomy closure, an ultrasonographic verification of the biological valve function was performed followed by a decannulation and sternotomy closure in a standard manner, respectively.Patient recovered from the procedure without any further complications and was discharged on the 9th postoperative day with normally functioning aortic biological valve prosthesis.Conventional aortic valve replacement is the gold standard for the treatment of aortic valve stenosis. However, TAVI has emerged and proved itself as a credible alternative for high-risk patients and patients in advanced age [1, 13]. The latest meta-analysis had shown the safety and efficacy of TAVI when compared to the standard surgical treatment [14]. The other decisive and promising medical indication is an implantation of TAVI into a failing bioprosthetic aortic valve [15]. With more frequent implantation of TAVI in younger and high-risk patients, postprocedural complications such as bleeding, stroke, atrial fibrillation, bacterial endocarditis, late TAVI embolization, TAVI thrombosis, and structural TAVI failure are becoming examined and documented more frequently [9, 16]. On the other hand, periprocedural complications except for paravalvular leaks are documented very rarely [9, 10, 17]. Paravalvular leaks were described as one of the greatest weaknesses of TAVI as they negatively impact mid- and long-term results [18]. However, our presented case shows that even “high-risk” patients may not necessarily benefit from TAVI implantation as the device failure will force the patients to undergo a conventional surgical aortic valve replacement with additional risk of adding TAVI explanation into the equation, thus prolonging and complicating the surgery [19].TAVI dislocation is a rare but serious complication which if left untreated can have a severe impact on patient’s prognosis. Ussia et al. described three main reasons for TAVI dislocation; accidental dislocation immediately after valve implantation, dislocation during the snaring manoeuvre to reposition a low deployment, and intentional dislocation performed as a bailout in cases of coronary ostia impairment [20]. Zahn et al. reported TAVI migration, to the ascending and descending aorta, occurring during few cardiac cycles following the valve deployment [21]. Mechanism of TAVI dislocation and its subsequent placement correction can be greatly affected by the TAVI deployment mechanism: self-expanding versus balloon-expanding [19].In this presented case, we experienced two types of acute TAVI dislocation. The first type of dislocation was caudal to the left ventricle. This type of dislocation was caused by known tendency of CoreValve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) to move downward due to very high radial forces that are inserted during implantation. The second dislocation was cranial to the aortic root. The main reason for this type of dislocation was postdilation in borderline high position most likely combined with extrasystole during fast pacing.High efficacy and safety of TAVI procedures in cardiac centers are strongly correlated with high-volume implantation and thorough analysis and documentation of complications and their solutions [22].Medical reports documenting TAVI dislocations are very rare. Their true incidence is most likely to be significantly higher. TAVI implantation is associated with a significant learning curve. Understanding the mechanisms of TAVI failures is crucial as the number of implanted TAVIs is rapidly growing.Submerging CoreValve into ice-cold saline solution causes the shrinkage of the metallic valve skeleton, thus allowing a technically easier resection of the graft assuming that it is not ingrown into the aorta or aortic annulus.Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s family for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

Sorafenib-Associated Heart Failure Complicated by Cardiogenic Shock after Treatment of Advanced Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Clinical Case Discussion
1University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX,  USA2Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Candace Wu; ude.nretsewhtuostu@uw.ecadnacReceived 1 November 2016; Accepted 13 April 2017; Published 27 April 2017Academic Editor: Kuan-Rau ChiouCopyright © 2017 Candace Wu  and Kamal Shemisa. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Background. Sorafenib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), targets multiple tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth. Studies suggest that inhibition of TKR impacts cardiomyocyte survival. Inhibition of VEGF signaling interrupts angiogenesis and is associated with the development of hypertension and compensatory hypertrophy. Compensated hypertrophy ultimately leads to heart failure. Case Description. A 76-year-old man with a past medical history of systolic heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy and stage IIIC hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presented with symptoms of decompensated heart failure. Four months prior to admission, he was started on sorafenib. Results. Our patient was treated with intravenous furosemide and guideline directed therapy. Clinical status was complicated by the development of low cardiac output and shock requiring inotropic support. Careful titration of heart failure medication led to hemodynamic improvement and discontinuation of dobutamine. Conclusion. Greater awareness of sorafenib cardiotoxicity is essential. As TKI usage grows for treatment of cancers, heart failure-related complications will increase. In our patient, routine heart failure management and cessation of sorafenib led to clinical improvement. Future studies on the treatment of sorafenib cardiotoxicity should be explored further in this unique patient population. Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets pathways involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth by inhibiting tyrosine kinase receptors and is recommended as a first-line drug for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma due to limited alternatives. The effect of sorafenib on the human body is not limited to hepatocellular cancer cells and has been linked to cardiovascular toxicity leading to the pathogenesis of clinical heart failure and resistant hypertension [1, 2].This report presents the clinical case of a patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy and advanced HCC who was started on sorafenib and subsequently developed heart failure complicated by cardiogenic shock. We will review the clinical case, the biological basis for TKI cardiac toxicity, and the therapeutic challenges and considerations for the treatment of sorafenib-associated hypertension and heart failure.A 76-year-old man presented with worsening dyspnea at rest and on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The past medical history was significant for single-vessel coronary artery disease (s/p percutaneous coronary intervention), systolic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 37%) due to ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe ventricular hypertrophy, chronic atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type two, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Stage IIIC hepatocellular carcinoma. Family history was positive for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type two. He was previously treated with guideline directed therapy for systolic heart failure (Table 1). The transthoracic echocardiogram was significant for moderately depressed left ventricular (LV) function, left atrial dilation, normal ventricular chamber dimensions, increased LV mass, and global hypokinesis (Figure 1).Eight months prior to admission, a cardiac MRI demonstrated findings suggestive of mild inferior wall myocardial ischemia on gadolinium imaging and moderately depressed systolic dysfunction. He was treated medically for ischemic heart failure without further risk stratification. Four months prior to admission, the patient was incidentally found to have a palpable right upper quadrant mass, which, by ultrasound, revealed a large heterogeneous echogenic density (measuring 13 cm). He underwent transhepatic biopsy and pathologic results were significant for poorly differentiated pleomorphic hepatocellular carcinoma. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was significant for tumor extension into the inferior vena cava and subdiaphragmatic space. A markedly elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (>10,000 ng/mL) was measured, suggestive of a high tumor burden.His WHO cancer staging was Stage IIIC based on clinical as well as imaging findings. The 1-year survival of Stage IIIC HCC is 6–8 months for patients and the recommended treatment is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) called sorafenib, which extends median survival length to 10.7 months [3].The patient presented to the emergency department hypertensive (169/79 mmHg) and tachycardic with a ventricular rate of 127 beats per minute (Figure 2). The physical exam was consistent with volume overload, and admission labs were notable for elevated BNP, abnormal BUN/creatinine, and elevated liver function tests (Table 2). Chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous congestion and a moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion.The clinical exam was consistent with decompensated heart failure. The patient was treated with intravenous furosemide, carvedilol, and lisinopril. After sufficient diuresis (10 liters of fluid), clinical symptoms improved minimally (Table 3). However, within the subsequent 18 hours, the patient developed persistent hypotension (MAP 60 mmHg), worsening renal function, and cool extremities indicative of impending cardiogenic shock. He continued to have elevation of JVP on physical exam, which suggested restrictive filling of the right ventricle (RV) as well as RV failure. A pulse wave Doppler across the LVOT suggested diminished stroke volume after calculation of the LV velocity time integral (Figure 3). A right heart catheterization was subsequently performed which showed mildly elevated right- and left-sided ventricular filling pressure, pulmonary hypertension, and low cardiac output (Table 3). He was then treated with continuous infusion of dobutamine and furosemide. An EKG at the time demonstrated improvement of the ventricular rate without evidence of ST-T wave changes (Figure 4).Based on the antecedent history of recent initiation of sorafenib followed by deterioration in cardiac function, sorafenib-induced decompensated heart failure was diagnosed. This case report serves as an example of the therapeutic challenges of heart failure management in patients treated for hepatocellular carcinoma with sorafenib. The cardiac toxicity of sorafenib is known and while many patients who have preexisting heart failure are not initiated on tyrosine kinase inhibitors for this reason, limited therapies for cancers such as HCC may compel care providers to do so. Cautious clinical decision-making, heart failure follow-up, and recognition of higher risk groups in this unique subset of patients are needed. It is our goal to discuss the mechanism of sorafenib-associated cardiac toxicity and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We also review clinical strategies for treatment of heart failure complications.Sorafenib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets multiple tyrosine kinase receptors involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth and is recommended as a first-line drug for the treatment of advanced HCC [1]. In cancer cells, tyrosine kinase activity is increased due to mutations in the genes associated with the fundamental regulatory components of the enzyme. Mutations in cancer cells can also lead to overexpression of the tyrosine kinase genes. Tyrosine kinase inhibition is mediated through binding of a ligand or antibody (inhibitor), thus preventing the receptor from achieving its activated form. Autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase subsequently activates a series of protein kinase cascades in one of two dominant pathways involved in cell proliferation, hypertrophy, function, and survival. These are the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway via AKT or the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade via RAS and ERK (extracellular signal regulated kinase) [4, 5].The Signaling Pathway of Tyrosine Kinases, Sites of Inhibition, and Cardiotoxicity Secondary to Trastuzumab following Treatment of HER2+ Breast Cancer. To further understand the reasons for sorafenib-associated cardiotoxicity, it is relevant to discuss the lessons learned from earlier generation TKIs, the exact cellular pathways affected, and the mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of clinical heart failure. Patients with ERBB2 receptor, also known as HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor), breast cancer that were receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy were 3.5 times more likely (8% versus 27%, ) to develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction on echocardiography or clinical heart failure [6]. Clinically significant predictors for cardiac toxicity among several cohorts receiving trastuzumab were history of cardiac disease at baseline, treatment with anthracyclines, and age > 70 years [7, 8].The true incidence of heart failure secondary to trastuzumab alone was likely unknown due to treatment confounding with anthracyclines and taxanes. Assessing the true clinical risk of cardiomyopathy among patients receiving trastuzumab has therefore led to clinical trials with prespecified cardiac end points which estimate the incidence to be less frequent when administered alone (4–7%) [9, 10]. Clinical follow-up data from these trials further demonstrated that trastuzumab cardiac toxicity is reversible shortly after discontinuation and may be responsive to medical therapy [11]. This would suggest that the severity of cardiac toxicity secondary to TKIs is most pronounced when the cardiac myocyte is simultaneously weakened by another process that creates an energy deficit, and, subsequently, the required metabolic signaling needed to maintain survival is hindered through the disruption of these critical pathways. As will be described, the degree of cardiac toxicity caused by TKIs depends on the inhibitory effect on the dominant signaling pathway of the cardiac myocyte, the selectivity of tyrosine kinase inhibition, the concomitant treatment with older cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, anthracyclines or taxanes, and the duration of treatment [10, 12]. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Promotes an Energy Deficit and Interferes with Cardiac Myocyte Survival Pathways. TKIs are considered very effective in the treatment of the respective cancers but, as was described, can have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. Both clinical experiences followed by basic investigations regarding deficient cellular signaling due to trastuzumab and bevacizumab have furthered our understanding of the importance of tyrosine kinase signaling in the pathogenesis of heart failure and hypertension in patients receiving these treatments for cancer. As newer TKIs are being developed, there is greater scrutiny for reporting adverse cardiovascular events during clinical trials. In the search for better and more effective anticancer drugs, multikinase inhibitors were developed to achieve greater inhibition of TKR and downstream signaling. The ultimate effect of less selectivity is the shutting down of signaling, ATP utilization, and the cell machinery for cell division. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, was designed for the inhibition of cell proliferation.Studies that have elucidated the cellular mechanisms behind cardiotoxicity due to sorafenib suggest that inhibition of RAF-1 and B-RAF kinase impact cardiomyocyte survival (Figure 5) [12]. RAF-1 signaling phosphorylates a series of kinases in the MAPK group, MEK1 and ERK1, which potentiates cardiac myocyte hypertrophic growth and survival [13, 14].The RAF-1 kinase also inhibits cell death pathways mediated by apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) as well as mammalian sterile 20 kinase 2 (MST2). Both ASK1 and MST2 are proapoptotic kinases and have roles in oxidant stress-induced injury. Deletions of RAF-1 in the heart result in ventricular dilation, reduced contractility, and increased cell death [12, 15]. When mice with deleted RAF-1 are subjected to pressure overload, cardiomyocyte death was increased, indicating that RAF-1 kinase activity may be cardioprotective [16].Nonselective TKIs such as sorafenib that target multiple kinases have great potential for intracellular toxicity. Myocardial cells require greater energy demands than other cells and therefore are particularly sensitive to deficiencies in energy production. Some case reports have indicated the potential for reversibility of sorafenib-induced cardiomyopathy after discontinuation though it is unclear to what extent or after what duration of treatment that reversibility is still feasible [17].Mechanism of Cardiotoxicity after Treatment with Sorafenib May Be In Part due to VEGF Inhibition. TKRs were initially noted to enhance gene expression and protein synthesis involved in cardiac hypertrophy [18]. Deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system were observed with inhibition of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and PDGF (platelet derived growth factor) receptors. Inhibition of VEGF signaling with bevacizumab was shown to increase vascular tone and disrupt microvascular blood flow [19, 20]. Clinical consequences of disrupting VEGF signaling include a higher risk for worsening hypertension and a twofold greater risk for heart failure among patients with cancers of solid tumor origin [21, 22]. Among patients undergoing treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with sorafenib, 68% had some form of cardiovascular toxicity, with most cases (59%) having worsened hypertension. Newly diagnosed heart failure, defined as an elevation in NT-proBNP and a decline in LVEF, occurred in 40% of patients on sunitinib and in 4% of patients on sorafenib [2]. In a meta-analysis of 21 randomized controlled trials with patients undergoing treatment of HCC, there was a 2.7-fold greater heart failure risk in those that received TKIs compared to those who did not (2.39% versus 0.75%, ) [23]. Therapeutic Challenges and Considerations in the Treatment of Hypertension. Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in the world and typically presents in advanced stages. Standard treatments during early stages include partial hepatectomy, local ablation, and liver transplantation. Sorafenib is recommended as a first-line drug for the treatment of advanced HCC [1, 2].In the case of sorafenib-induced hypertension, blood pressure is treated with conventional therapy and appears not to impact or worsen progression-free survival among patients treated for metastatic RCC [24]. Early intervention of hypertension is essential to reduce subsequent risks of developing cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The Angiogenesis Task Force of the National Cancer Institute Investigational Drug Steering Committee recommends regular blood pressure monitoring before treatment as well as during treatment, weekly during the first cycle and then every 2-3 weeks, with a goal BP of less than 140/90 mmHg for most patients and a goal BP of less than 130/80 for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease [25]. Sorafenib is also associated with the development of proteinuria, and it is recommended that urine protein be tested before and after treatment initiation. When patients develop proteinuria, clinicians should strive to control blood pressure with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), which have been recommended as first- and second-line agents (Figure 6) [26]. Treatment with ACE-I is contraindicated if patients develop hyperkalemia, severe cough, or angioedema or have advanced chronic kidney disease. Transitioning to angiotensin receptor blocker is possible in those patients intolerant to ACE-I though clinical data is limited. Discontinuation of sorafenib can be considered in patients with resistant hypertension.Therapeutic Challenges and Considerations in the Treatment of Systolic Heart Failure. Although it is typically recommended that chemotherapy be discontinued when significant heart failure develops, case reports have shown that sorafenib can be used to treat advanced HCC for as long as 12 months and may be reduced in those that develop heart failure [1]. It is difficult to know which heart failure medications would benefit patients exposed to TKIs. Very few clinical studies have investigated the treatment of heart failure due to TKIs in a prospective fashion. Newer generation TKIs are less selective than their predecessors, and while the cancer cell growth is strongly halted, the potential for cardiac toxicity is higher. At this time there are no medications that specifically target and reverse TKI-related cardiotoxicity. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents should be monitored carefully. A baseline echocardiogram prior to treatment with TKIs in patients with cardiac risk factors and close follow-up in monitoring for heart failure symptoms is appropriate [27, 28].In patients that develop clinical heart failure or systolic dysfunction on echocardiography, treatment with a combination of guideline directed ACE-I, and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce heart failure-associated mortality and improve cardiovascular morbidity [27]. The most well studied agents in the treatment of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy are carvedilol and enalapril though the mechanism, severity, and toxicity of anthracyclines differ from the cardiotoxicity of TKIs [29, 30]. Aldosterone antagonists have also been shown to further reduce mortality in advanced heart failure in patients with systolic heart failure, LVEF < 35%, and NYHA III-IV. Treatment of salt and water retention in systolic heart failure is further treated with loop diuretics. Implantable defibrillators used as primary prevention for sudden cardiac death are recommended in those with greater than a 1-year life expectancy with persistently severe LV dysfunction for greater than three months despite optimal medical therapy. In patients that develop heart failure symptoms and successfully complete treatment with TKIs, follow-up echocardiography is appropriate to assess for reversal of LV dysfunction [26]. Dobutamine Treatment May Be Considered in Those with Severe Heart Failure. Baseline diminished contractile reserve with subsequent exposure to sorafenib led to the development of cardiogenic shock in our patient who was subsequently treated with dobutamine, an inotrope with weaker chronotropic effects, which successfully restored a normal hemodynamic profile. While it is well known that inotropic support is associated with adverse long-term cardiovascular outcomes, the clinical efficacy of inotropes after exposure to cardiac toxic medications is unknown. Dobutamine’s pharmacologic function does not depend on tyrosine kinases but rather on G-protein coupled receptors. Whether sensitivity to beta-1 adrenergic activation by dobutamine is increased after tyrosine kinase inhibition is unknown. In response to isoproterenol, the presence of genistein was shown to potentiate beta-adrenergic sensitivity in the heart of animal models [31].In our patient with underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, the management of heart failure in the setting of coexisting malignancy poses interesting and new clinical challenges. Sorafenib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets multiple tyrosine kinase receptors involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth. Unfortunately, sorafenib-associated cardiotoxic effects such as hypertension, reduced LVEF, and heart failure are of great concern and contribute to the challenging nature of HCC management. It is essential that TKI-induced hypertension be treated aggressively with standard treatments and regular monitoring. Guidelines also recommend echocardiogram monitoring for patients started on chemotherapeutic agents, especially those with cardiac risk factors, prior to treatment initiation, once heart failure symptoms develop, and after treatment completion. There are currently no specific recommendations for managing TKI-induced heart failure, and patients are typically managed with standard heart failure treatments. Beta-adrenergic effects of dobutamine may actually be potentiated by tyrosine kinase inhibition.We initially considered more common causes for heart failure exacerbation in our patient. Patients with restrictive heart failure often develop worsened heart failure symptoms due to sustained periods of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Prior to hospitalization, however, the patient’s ventricular rate was well controlled with beta blockade, and it is our belief that the interval decline in ventricular function led to increased left atrial pressure and presentation of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Furthermore, there were no EKG abnormalities suggestive of myocardial infarction or evidence of severe valvular regurgitation on echocardiography. There was the possibility that overdiuresis due to an inability to accurately estimate the filling pressures on physical exam led to inadequate preload leading to low cardiac output shock. However, the patient’s right heart catheterization reflected that the filling pressures remained elevated after diuresis and that the etiology of low cardiac output was mainly attributed to diminished contractility.After successful titration of guideline directed treatment and discontinuation of dobutamine, a repeat echo demonstrated baseline LV function. A repeat trial of sorafenib at a lower dose was offered to the patient but was declined. Although sorafenib is the potential predisposing factor for the patient’s decompensation, the causal relationship between this drug and heart failure is still unclear since rechallenge was not performed. The patient was discharged home with palliative care follow-up for coordination of hospice.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
A Novel, Modified Reverse Controlled Antegrade and Retrograde Subintimal Tracking Technique for Bypassing the Calcified Proximal Cap of Coronary Total Occlusions
1Department of Cardiology, Sendai Kousei Hospital, Sendai,  Japan2Department of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery, Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital, Yokohama,  JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Tsuyoshi Isawa; pj.oc.oohay@oyust_asiReceived 1 November 2016; Revised 15 March 2017; Accepted 13 April 2017; Published 26 April 2017Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2017 Tsuyoshi Isawa et al.

However, it is sometimes difficult to penetrate the proximal hard cap with guidewires, especially in the case of CTOs of anomalous coronary arteries because of a lack of support. Herein, we describe a novel, modified reverse controlled antegrade and retrograde subintimal tracking (CART) technique in which the dissection reentry was intentionally created in the proximal segment of the vessel, not within the occluded segment, using retrograde guidewire and the aid of an antegrade balloon. This technique facilitated retrograde crossing of CTOs by avoiding the proximal hard cap and may provide a viable option for patients in which conventional reverse CART is not possible.A chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) is defined as the complete obstruction of a coronary artery that is more than 3 months old [1]. The recent meta-analysis revealed that successful recanalization of a CTO resulted in the overall improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction, reduced adverse remodeling, and an improvement of survival [2]. In percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO, antegrade crossing is commonly used to target CTO lesions [3]. However, penetrating the proximal hard cap with guidewires is challenging, especially in cases of anomalous coronary arteries. Consequently, contemporary reverse controlled antegrade and retrograde subintimal tracking (CART) [4], one of the most common techniques used in retrograde PCI, cannot be applied in such cases due to failure in antegrade preparation (creating an antegrade dissected space using an antegrade wire and balloon). To overcome such obstacles, we herein present a novel, modified reverse CART technique in which the dissection reentry is intentionally created in the proximal vessel, not within the occluded segment, by an antegrade balloon, which is followed by maneuvering the retrograde guidewire through the subintimal space into the proximal true lumen.A 65-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes mellitus presented to our hospital with Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class III angina despite being on optimal medical therapy, including beta-blockers and long-acting nitrates. An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 66 beats/min without abnormal QS wave patterns. An echocardiogram revealed normal overall left ventricular function. The diagnostic angiography showed a CTO in the mid-segment of the anomalous right coronary artery (RCA) with a high anterior take-off from the ascending aorta and a proximal cap ambiguity of RCA-CTO because of side branches, including the sinoatrial node artery and right ventricular artery, arising near the occlusion site. The Japan-CTO score, a 5-point scoring system to assess the difficulty of CTO crossing [5], was 3. The distal vessel received several tortuous epicardial collateral channels between the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and posterior descending artery via the apex. To note, there were no interventional collateral channels from the septal arteries to the distal RCA (Figure 1).After discussion among the clinical heart team, PCI of a RCA-CTO was scheduled. Vascular access was obtained using bilateral femoral 7-Fr and 8-Fr long sheaths. Particularly, 7-Fr Hyperion AL 1 (Asahi Intecc, Aichi, Japan) and 7-Fr CLS 3.5 (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) with side holes were utilized to engage RCA and the left main coronary artery, respectively. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) examination from the right ventricular artery revealed that the heavily calcified plaque blocked entry of the CTO, suggesting difficulty in any guidewires penetrating into the CTO lesion (Figure 2).Therefore, a primary retrograde strategy using the epicardial collateral channels via the apex was performed. A Corsair Pro (Asahi Intecc) catheter was advanced into the distal LAD over a workhorse wire. Tip contrast injection revealed epicardial collateral channels. A SION guidewire (Asahi Intecc) was used as a first-line guidewire to cross the collateral channels, but it was unable to be crossed. Instead, for smoother and softer channel navigation, a SUOH 03 guidewire (Asahi Intecc) was used, which successfully traversed the collateral channels, while forming a knuckle, and thereafter a Corsair Pro catheter could follow (Movies 1 and 2 in Supplementary Material available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/3850646). Reaching the distal end of CTO, the SUOH 03 guidewire was exchanged for a Gaia Third guidewire (Asahi Intecc). It was advanced retrogradely into the subintimal space past CTO ostium (Figure 3). Then, an antegrade balloon-assisted communication with the subintimal space was created proximally to the occluded segment using a 4.0 × 15.0 mm trek (Abbott Vascular), where the retrograde Gaia Third guidewire was entered, successfully penetrating the proximal true lumen (Figure 4) and reaching the aorta in a retrograde manner (Movie 3). The Corsair Pro was advanced similarly, followed by retrograde guidewire externalization with an RG3 300 cm guidewire (Asahi Intecc). The IVUS showed that the externalized guidewire traversed the CTO lesion, avoiding the heavily calcified plaque of the ostium (Figure 5). Afterwards, four drug-eluting stents were sequentially deployed from the distal to proximal RCA, and the final angiogram provided assurance, thereby allowing the procedure to be completed without any complications (Figure 6). The patient is currently free of symptoms after a 1-month follow-up.In this case report, we described a novel modified reverse CART technique for impenetrable CTOs in combination of epicardial collateral channels crossing using a SUOH 03 guidewire. The present case revealed that the novel modified reverse CART was feasible in CTO lesions with severely calcified proximal cap, even if an antegrade guidewire could not advance into the CTO segment, by retrogradely advancing a controllable guidewire into subintimal space past the CTO ostium, with a retrograde guidewire bypassing the calcified proximal cap of CTO.In this novel technique, dissection was intentionally created in the proximal vessel, not within the occluded segment, using an antegrade balloon inflation, and reentry was achieved in the proximal vessel, using a retrograde guidewire. Strictly speaking, we did not check if the antegrade balloon actually caused intimal disruption with intravascular ultrasound. However, a balloon that was large enough to cause intimal disruption was chosen, although the balloon-to-artery ratio should always be less than 1.19 for preventing coronary perforation [6].In the contemporary reverse CART technique, the connection is established within the occluded segment to minimize the length of subintimal stenting and prevent side branch loss [4]. However, reverse CART technique requires antegrade preparation, where a small antegrade balloon is inflated near the distal end of CTO, before retrograde wiring [4]. On the other hand, the novel technique we described here can be applied to impenetrable and suspected impenetrable CTOs even if antegrade preparation is impossible or unsuccessful. In comparison with the previous report [7], in this study, dissection is created proximal to the CTO and reentry is also achieved in the true lumen proximal to the CTO. The method presented here is included in the “Hybrid Approach” in PCI of the CTO lesions. In the Hybrid Approach, retrograde intentional dissection is very frequently used to get around heavily calcified CTO segments. Our novel method has several advantages. First, it can be applied to any CTO lesions where strong backup support by the antegrade guiding catheters is difficult to obtain. Entering into the proximal cap of CTO requires enough backup force, which would have been difficult in our patient with anomalous RCA-CTO without any side branches suitable for the anchor balloon technique. On the other hand, entering into the distal occluded segment by retrograde guidewire is easier because the distal cap of the CTO lesions is usually softer than the proximal cap [8]. Another advantage of our technique is that proximal reentry into the true lumen is easier than distal reentry because of the larger caliber vessel. Lastly, the availability of IVUS, if suitable side branch is present, can help operators confirm the position of the retrograde guidewire within the vessels.A new specific guidewire, SUOH 03, is of great use in crossing epicardial collateral channels, which is one of the most important steps in reverse CART. Septal collateral channels are safer than the epicardial ones and should be preferred in most cases [9]. However, we have no choice but to use epicardial collateral channels in cases where the septal connections cannot be visualized. Epicardial channels are challenging for generally recommended guidewires, such as SION and Fielder XTR (Asahi Intecc). We have demonstrated that introduction of the SUOH 03 guidewire allowed for much smoother and softer channel navigation. It is extremely flexible from the tip; the tip load is only 0.3 gram-force and therefore enables crossing the small bended vessels, as shown in the present case.There are a few limitations to this modified reverse CART technique. It cannot be applied to occluded vessels that have significant proximal side branches because subintimal reentry and subsequent stent deployment can cause side branch loss. Establishing retrograde access through collateral channels is mandatory for application of this technique but is not always successful. In addition, diffuse and very heavy calcification within CTO, which disturbs direct retrograde crossing or knuckle wiring, may prevent use of this technique.In summary, a modified, reverse CART technique combined with a retrograde approach for bypassing the calcified proximal cap was effectively and safely utilized in our patient. Successful passage of tortuous collateral channels, which is an important step of this technique, was accomplished by the use of a new specific guidewire, SUOH 03.Clinical description of this case report was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Sendai Kousei Hospital.Informed consent or substitute was obtained from the patient in this study.Dr. Masahiko Ochiai has served on the Speakers’ Bureau for Abbott Vascular, Asahi Intecc, and Boston Scientific.

Cryoablation for Ventricular Tachycardia Originating from Anterior Papillary Muscle of Left Ventricle Guided by Intracardiac Echocardiography
1Division of Pacing and Electrophysiology, Cardiovascular Center, Padeh-Poriya Hospital, Tiberias,  Israel2Davidai Arrhythmia Center, Heart Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer,  IsraelCorrespondence should be addressed to Ibrahim Marai; li.vog.htlaeh.airop@iaramiReceived 14 January 2017; Accepted 27 February 2017; Published 20 April 2017Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2017 Ibrahim Marai et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Papillary muscles (PMs) were reported to be origin of ventricular arrhythmia (VA). Radiofrequency (RF) ablation was reported to be acutely effective in eliminating VA. However, the recurrence rate is high. Recently, cryoablation guided by intracardiac echocardiography, 3-dimensional mapping system, and image integration was introduced as alternative strategy for this challenging ablation. We present a case of ventricular tachycardia originating from anterior PM of left ventricle treated by cryoablation guided only by intracardiac echocardiography.Papillary muscles (PMs) were reported to be origin of ventricular arrhythmia (VA). Radiofrequency (RF) ablation was reported to be acutely effective in eliminating VA [1]. However, the recurrence rate is high. Recently, cryoablation was introduced as alternative strategy for this challenging ablation.A 75-year-old woman was admitted because of wide complex tachycardia with right bundle branch block pattern and right inferior axis. She was treated with adenosine and verapamil with no effect. Sinus rhythm was achieved by DC shock. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal systolic function without wall motion abnormalities, moderate concentric hypertrophy, and severe aortic stenosis. Coronary angiography showed nonsignificant stenosis of left anterior descending artery.The patient underwent electrophysiological study. The procedure was performed under conscious sedation. Standard multielectrode catheters were placed in the His bundle region, coronary sinus, and RV apex through the right and left femoral veins. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) resembling the clinical tachycardia was easily induced by programmed electrical stimulation from the RV apex. The arrhythmia was nonsustained and became sustained after isoproterenol infusion. Spontaneous changes in QRS morphology were observed (Figure 1). 6 mm cryoablation (Freezor MAX 3, Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) catheter was advanced into the left ventricle (LV) via deflectable sheath through a transseptal and transmitral approach. Intravenous heparin was administered to maintain an activated clotting time of 300 s. A 2-dimensional intracardiac echo (ICE) probe was advanced via femoral vein and localized at right ventricular outflow tract to visualize real-time location of cryocatheter during mapping and ablation. Activation mapping by the cryocatheter revealed that the site of origin was at anterior PM of LV as confirmed by ICE (Figure 2). No Purkinje potentials were recorded at the ablation site during sinus rhythm. Prepotential preceding the surface QRS by 35 milliseconds was recorded at the ablation site during VT (Figure 3(a)). The VT was mechanically interrupted by the contact of the cryocatheter with the base of anterior PM but nonsustained VT recurred until freezing was started. During and after the first application, VA could not be induced with and without isoproterenol (Figure 3(b)). Another 2 applications were done at both sides of anterior PM (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). Finally, 3 applications up to 240 s with freeze-thaw-freeze cycles were done. During 45 minutes after the end applications, no VA could be induced. No mitral regurgitation was seen at the end of the procedure. Three-dimensional mapping system was not used. The patient was free of VA and free of mitral regurgitation during follow-up of 4 months.Catheter ablation of PM VAs is challenging compared with the other VA in the LV [1]. The complex anatomic structure of PMs may lead to multiple QRS morphologies and causes difficulties in catheter manipulation and stabilization during mapping and ablation [2]. The maneuverability of the catheter is more challenging if a deflectable sheath is not employed. This can explain the high recurrence rate after RF ablation.Yamada et al. [2] reported their experience of RF ablation for VA originating from LV PM using 3-dimensional (3D) electroanatomic mapping system. In all () patients, transthoracic and intracardiac echocardiography and left ventriculography revealed that the successful ablation sites were localized at the base of the PMs in the LV. Additional ablation targeting a relatively wide area around the first RF lesion was required to completely eliminate the VAs in all patients. Multiple QRS morphologies were seen spontaneously and after the ablation in 47% of patients. RF lesions on both sides of the PMs were required in these patients. During the follow-up, VAs recurred in 58% of patients.Rivera et al. [3] performed focal cryoablation, up to 240 s with freeze-thaw-freeze using an 8 mm cryoablation catheter via a transmitral approach in 10 patents with PM VAs. In this study, VAs foci were localized to anterior or posterior PM using 3D mapping system, multidetector computed tomography (CT), and ICE. Termination of VA was observed in all patients during ablation. VA recurred in 1 (10%) patient.In another study, Rivera et al. [4] compared outcomes and complications of catheter ablation of VA from the PM of the LV (localized using 3D mapping system, multidetector CT, and ICE) with either cryoenergy or RF. Acute success rate was 100% for cryoenergy and 78% for RF radiofrequency (). Catheter stability was achieved in all patients treated with cryoenergy and only in 25% patients treated with RF (). Incidence of multiple VA morphologies was observed in 77.7% patients treated with RF, whereas none was observed in those treated with cryoenergy (). VA recurrence at 6 months’ follow-up was 0% for cryoablation and 44% for RF ().The acute and long-term advantage of cryocatheter over RF catheter is stability during energy application. Keeping good contact of RF catheter with tissue during the whole period of RF application is very difficult because of contractility of both LV and PM. In addition, ablation of wide area on both sides of the PMs might be required to completely eliminate VA as changes in QRS morphology and a shift in the breakout site to the opposite side of the PM can occur spontaneously and after the ablation [2]. During freezing, within few seconds the cryocatheter adheres to tissue leading to maximal stability during all the time of application as showed nicely by Rivera et al. [4]. In our case, during the first application we tried to induce VA by pacing from RV apex without affecting stability of cryocatheter.The uniqueness of our case is that cryoablation was guided by ICE without 3D mapping system or CT image integration. Cryocatheter can be integrated with the NavX system but not with the CARTO system. So we could not use 3D mapping system as we have only the CARTO system in our laboratory. Many centers have only 1 3D mapping system. In addition, ICE can help to localize the origin of arrhythmia, although differentiating ventricular arrhythmias originating from the papillary muscle and the fascicles is challenging and not always possible [5]. It can facilitate 3D electroanatomical mapping allowing for real-time creation of precise geometries of cardiac chambers and endocavitary structures [6]. Nakahara et al. reported that multipolar catheters may be helpful for identifying tachycardia origins arising from the posterior papillary muscle [7]. Thus, the feasibility of performing cryoablation of papillary muscle with the guidance of ICE without 3D mapping system is very important.In summary, cryoablation guided only by ICE of VA originating from papillary muscle is feasible and should be considered as alternative strategy in this challenging condition.There are no conflicts of interest.
Left Atrial Myxoma in Pregnancy: Management Strategy Using Minimally Invasive Surgical Approach
1Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai,  Thailand2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai,  Thailand3Cardiology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai,  ThailandCorrespondence should be addressed to Noppon Taksaudom; moc.liamtoh@nopponrdReceived 15 February 2017; Accepted 6 April 2017; Published 16 April 2017Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2017 Noppon Taksaudom et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.This case report concerns a young woman who, during her pregnancy, suffered severe mitral regurgitation. It was discovered at the same time that she had a left atrial myxoma. During the early postpartum period she successfully underwent an anterior minithoracotomy to remove the left atrial myxoma in conjunction with repair of the mitral valve. The thoracotomy approach in this specific patient was chosen as it would give a better chance of successful mother-child bonding because the patient would be able to avoid the precautions which would have been necessary following a sternotomy, especially the limitation of her ability to hold her child during the first 4–6 weeks postoperatively.Cardiac myxoma is the most common type of benign cardiac tumor which can occur at any age. It occurs mostly in women and is sometimes detected during pregnancy [1]. Cardiac myxoma in pregnant woman is extremely rare; the most recent literature review published in 2015 reported only 51 cases from 44 publications, and its management is also very difficult [2]. The overall perinatal mortality is very high in pregnant woman undergoing cardiac surgery especially if the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is used and in early gestational period [3]. The management decision in this particular case drew on the experience of numerous specialists including a cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, obstetrician, pediatrician, and a neonatologist. The multidisciplinary team approach has a crucial role in ensuring the best outcome for both mother and child [4]. The standard operative technique for dealing with a cardiac myxoma is the median sternotomy approach which allows the removal of the mass under cardiopulmonary bypass [1]. However, the sternal precautions needing to be applied after the sternotomy in order to avoid sternal dehiscence include using wound support, lifting restrictions, mobility aid restrictions, and driving restrictions [5]. These restriction protocols, especially weight lifting restrictions, may lead to poor child-mother bonding especially during the first 3 to 6 months after surgery and may interfere with breast feeding. In this particular complex situation, the operation was not solely dependent on the surgeon’s preference alone but a holistic approach from both the family’s perspective and the medical team needed to be applied.This report describes the case of an immediate postpartum patient with a very large left atrial myxoma and severe mitral regurgitation. The corrective surgery was carried out via the minithoracotomy approach in Chiang Mai University Hospital.A 28-year-old Burmese pregnant woman was referred to our institute because of complicated pregnancy. Two years previously, she had a history of progressive dyspnea and orthopnea. A thorough investigation was carried out, a large left atrial mass was diagnosed, and she was scheduled for surgery. Due to economic problems and poor communication the patient was lost from the schedule and all attempts to contact her failed. She arrived at the hospital again and was pregnant. The pregnancy was unplanned and she had had no antenatal care. The estimated gestation by ultrasound was 24 weeks. The patient reported constant dyspnea on exertion in NYHA II without any progression in symptoms. On physical examination, vital signs were stable with a pansystolic murmur grade IV at apex. The chest film showed cardiomegaly and the cardio : thoracic ratio was 60%. Electrocardiography showed a normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria. On echocardiographic examination, as shown in Figure 1, a large, smooth surface, mobile mass, measuring at least 9 × 4 cm was found in the left atrium. There was no calcification or bleeding in the mass. The stalk of the mass was attached to the interatrial septum. The mass protruded into the mitral valve orifice causing both significant left ventricular inflow obstruction and severe mitral regurgitation with mitral annular dilation. The left ventricle was dilated with a good ejection fraction at 70.1%. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes were 53 mL and 157 mL, respectively. The estimated pulmonary pressure was 75 mmHg which indicated severe pulmonary hypertension.The patient was admitted immediately. A multidisciplinary team was established to deal with this special situation including cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, obstetricians, anesthesiologists, pediatrics, and neonatologists. After extensive discussion, the conclusion was to wait for lung maturity and schedule her for an epidural, painless vaginal delivery with a back-up emergency plan for worst case scenario. At the 32nd week of gestation, corticosteroids were given to promote pulmonary maturity and labor was induced. Intensive fetal and maternal monitoring occurred at every step. A painless vaginal delivery was enabled by epidural anesthesia and only a mild degree of pulmonary edema was detected during labor. The male preterm neonate was considerably healthy for his age, with a weight of 1,900 gm and APGAR scores of 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes. The patient was returned to the cardiac intensive care unit for intensive monitoring. There was no clinical deterioration and she was still in NYHA II.Two weeks after delivery, the patient was scheduled for cardiac surgical correction. All preoperative investigations were within normal limits. The operative procedure was conducted under general anesthesia with single-lumen intubation. A central venous catheter was placed on the left internal jugular vein and a 6 Fr vascular sheath was placed on the right internal jugular vein. Transesophageal echocardiography was set up routinely. The patient was placed in a supine position with an inflatable bag placed beneath her right chest wall elevating the right side of the chest to achieve greater exposure. Standard antiseptic preparation was made. A 3 cm right inguinal incision was made allowing exploration of the common femoral artery and vein. Purse string sutures were placed on both vessels. A right submammary 5 cm incision was made and the pleural cavity was entered via the 4th intercostal space. Skin protector was placed round the incision without using a rib spreader. The patient was full heparinized and peripheral CPB was established from the right groin. The femoral arterial and venous cannulas were size 17 Fr and 20 Fr, respectively. Both cannulations were performed using Seldinger’s technique under TEE guidance. An additional venous cannula, number 14 Fr, was placed percutaneously via the right internal jugular vein again using Seldinger’s technique. A thoracoscopic port was inserted via the 3rd intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After achieving full bypass, ventilation was stopped and the lungs were collapsed. The pericardium was opened longitudinally from the superior vena cava (SVC) to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and 2 to 3 cm anterior to the right phrenic nerve. Both SVC and IVC were snared with large heavy silk. A cardioplegic cannula was placed in the ascending aorta. A Chitwood aortic clamp was passed from a separate small incision through the 2rd intercostal space at the midclavicular line. An aortic cross clamp was applied and the heart was arrested by the antegrade route with crystalloid Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate solution. Both SVC and IVC were fastened to achieve total bypass. The right atrium was opened along the atrioventricular groove. The interatrial septum was incised at the lower border of the fossa ovalis. A hanging stitch was placed and the interatrial septum was excised keeping 0.5 to 1 cm from the stalk of tumor. The tumor was removed easily without any adhesion with the residual atrial wall or mitral valve. The mass was delivered, with some additional rib traction, via submammary thoracotomy incision. The reddish bulky tumor was 8 cm × 5 cm × 6 cm in size and had a smooth and sleek surface with a small dense stalk attached to the limbus of the fossa ovalis as shown in Figure 2. The left ventricular venting cannula was placed after the mass was removed. Mitral valve analysis was done and revealed a grossly normal valve apart from a significant annular dilation. A saline test also showed a significant regurgitation. A mitral valve annuloplasty was done with Carpentier-Edwards Physio annuloplasty ring (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) number 34. The atrial septal defect was closed directly using continuous polypropylene 4/0 running sutures. The right atrial wall was closed. After rewarming and deairing, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the CPB was weaned off and terminated uneventfully. All wounds were closed and one chest drain was placed in the right pleural cavity. Total operative time was 3 hours and 40 minutes; cross clamp time and total bypass time were 105 and 160 minutes, respectively. Intraoperative TEE showed good results; there was no residual atrial defect and a resultant good competent mitral valve. The patient was extubated the next morning 14 hours after the operation; then she had a normal recovery with no significant complications. The chest drain was removed on the 2nd postoperative day and the chest film was normal.The patient was discharged 7 days after surgery. There was a delay of 3 days due to her preterm baby’s condition. She was clinically stable in NYHA I. However, early postoperative echocardiography showed severe reduction in ejection fraction of 20% with competent valvular function and no residual tumor. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes were 102 mL and 131 mL, respectively. However, heart size from the chest film gradually decreased on each visit until it became normal size as demonstrated in Figure 3. She was prescribed heart failure medications and warfarin as the mother could not breast feed due to no lactation occurring. Serial echocardiography 2 months postoperatively showed cardiac function was significantly improved with an ejection fraction of 42% and normal left ventricular size (left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes were 38 mL and 72 mL, resp.). Pathology report later confirmed the diagnosis of myxoma.Primary tumors of the heart are relatively rare and the most common are atrial myxomas which account for 50% of all primary cardiac tumors [1]. Left atrial myxoma in pregnant patients is extremely rare, only 51 cases being reported in the most recent literature review in 2015 [2]. From the comprehensive review the management of tumors in pregnancy is very varied; procedures include termination of pregnancy, tumor resection during pregnancy, delay in resection until the 3rd trimester is reached, or delayed cardiac surgery until after delivery. Both maternal and fetoneonatal outcomes are dependent on the shorter gestational age and the use of CPB [3, 6]. A previous publication suggested attempted delivery ahead of surgery/CPB or to defer surgery till late pregnancy [3]. However, cardiac myxoma has the associated risk of embolism especially in the hypercoagulable condition of pregnancy. Therefore, another publication suggested that a surgical excision be performed in all pregnant women [4]. In our case, this was a 28-year-old pregnant patient with a long history of left atrial myxoma without any history of embolism and she had both a very large left atrial myxoma and a significant mitral valve insufficiency which may have necessitated a more complicated operation and longer duration of surgery. From these reasons, our multidisciplinary team, including a cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, obstetrician, pediatrician, and neonatologist, reached a consensus in the management of this patient to delay the operation until 32 weeks’ gestation was reached increasing neonatal lung maturity. This patient successfully delivered, well-being being maintained using intensive monitoring of both fetal and maternal parameters without any significant complications.The median sternotomy was considered as a standard surgical approach for myxoma removal with a very low complication rate. However, there were numerous concerns about sternal precautions needed after the sternotomy to prevent sternal instability especially regarding weight lifting restrictions. There was no exact weight specified although data from a web-based survey in Australia by Tuyl et al. reported the common use of a weight restriction of 2 to 5 kg [5]. This may interfere with a normal maternal-child relationship and bonding because the mother would need to avoid holding her child due to pain and breast feeding may be difficult. In this case, we selected a right anterior minithoracotomy approach in order to avoid these issues.Several publications have reported using a minimally invasive approach in the treatment of cardiac myxoma [7–9]. Yang et al. also reported higher quality of life using a robotically assisted approach in atrial myxoma excision [10]. An anterior thoracotomy approach however is an excellent approach via both the right and left atria including the advantage of good mitral valve exposure. In our institute, minimally invasive mitral valve surgery is one of the standard approaches for simple valvular pathology and this has enhanced our experience in the minimally invasive field so we were not reluctant to use the minimally invasive approach for complex myxoma removal and mitral valve surgery. To enable a smaller incision, a video-assisted approach is a crucial adjunct procedure because the mitral valve visualization could be very difficult if the incision is placed medially to the right atrium. The patient had a rapid recovery and could have been discharged on the 4th day postoperatively but she needed to be admitted until her child was discharged. The poor ejection fraction recorded on the echocardiogram after surgery may represent the real ventricular function resulting from the eradication of the regurgitation through mitral insufficiency. However, the poor myocardial protection during minimally invasive approach is also considered as one cause of this myocardial suppression. In this case, we used single dose of crystalloid Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate solution. This cardioplegic solution needs proper topical cooling in the pericardial sac during operation. But from minimally invasive field, this would be hard to achieve from small incision. Nevertheless, the deairing maneuver during minimally invasive cardiac operation is also hard to complete because the surgeon is unable to complete the deairing maneuver directly. However, echocardiography was repeated before discharge and showed a gradual improvement of cardiac function. Unfortunately, lactation did not occur, so it was possible to prescribe normal heart failure medications including a beta-blocker, aldosterone antagonist, and warfarin. However, the patient could hold her child as much as she wished without any of the limitations that would have been from a sternal procedure which has made mother-child bonding much easier and hence more successful.In conclusion, the minimally invasive approach for atrial myxoma removal as a concurrent procedure with a mitral valve repair is feasible and safe with good cosmetic outcomes. Moreover, in a postpartum patient, this approach could avoid the numerous limitations resulting from a sternal incision and promotes excellent mother-child bonding during the crucial early period of a child’s life.The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

While early, periprocedural device embolization can normally be managed with snare and percutaneous retrieval, late embolization requires a different management strategy due to inability of the device to deform to allow passage into a large caliber sheath. We present a case of asymptomatic device embolization recognized six months following implantation and discuss the challenges encountered in successfully retrieving the device.Percutaneous device closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been utilized as a therapy for the prevention of recurrent cryptogenic stroke. With appropriate patient selection, low rates of recurrent embolic events can be achieved, with accrual of benefit seen with long-term follow-up [1, 2]. Procedural complications are uncommon, with vascular injury [3], cardiac perforation [4], air embolism, device fracture [5], and cardiac arrhythmia [6] reported. Device embolization is uncommon in PFO closure, particularly when compared to device closure of atrial septal defects. When device embolization occurs, it is typically recognized early, with delayed or late retrieval uncommon.We describe the late retrieval of an asymptomatic embolized patent foramen ovale occlusion device 6 months following device implant. The complicating issues relevant to late retrieval are discussed including the lack of deformability of the device and risk of distal embolization when difficulty with percutaneous retrieval is encountered.A 58-year-old man was referred for patent foramen ovale closure following a presumed cryptogenic stroke. The patient presented with transient hemiparesis, with MR imaging suggesting a previous additional, unrecognized cerebellar infarction. CT angiography of the neck and intracranial vessels was unremarkable. Ambulatory ECG monitoring did not detect any atrial fibrillation. Contrast transthoracic echocardiography suggested the presence of a patent foramen ovale with subsequent transoesophageal echocardiography confirming the presence of a PFO with an aneurysmal interatrial septum. In view of the absence of alternative mechanisms of stroke, MR imaging suggesting previous embolic events, and the desire to avoid lifelong anticoagulation, the patient was referred for percutaneous device closure.Under general anaesthesia and transoesophageal echocardiography guidance, a 30 mm Amplatzer fenestrated atrial septal occluder was delivered using a 9 Fr delivery system. The device was released uneventfully (Figure 1) and the final appearance on fluoroscopy (Figure 2) and transoesophageal echocardiography was excellent; device position was confirmed with a “push-pull” maneuver prior to device release. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed the following day demonstrating satisfactory device position with no evidence of pericardial effusion. The patient was then discharged on aspirin and clopidogrel. The patient remained asymptomatic. Routine repeat transthoracic echocardiography was undertaken six months following device implantation to assess for any residual shunt. The Amplatzer occlusion device was not visualized on transthoracic imaging with strongly positive right to left shunt noted. Subsequent transoesophageal imaging demonstrated absence of the occluder across the interatrial septum consistent with device embolization; the device could not be visualized in the main or branch pulmonary arteries. CT angiogram of the thoracic and abdominal aorta was performed and the device was located in the visceral abdominal aorta. There was no compromise of flow noted to either the visceral vessels or distal aorta.Arrangements were then made for percutaneous device retrieval. The right common femoral artery was exposed using a transverse incision and a 20 Fr Cook sheath was advanced through the right common femoral artery. Heparin was administered intravenously. The device was located in the abdominal aorta (Figure 3) with no compromise of mesenteric vessels observed. The device was initially snared with a 20 mm gooseneck snare; however the device could not be retrieved into the sheath due to lack of compressibility when withdrawal into the 20 Fr sheath was attempted. The gooseneck snare was then substituted for an ANL retriever; despite multiple attempts the device would not deform to allow passage into the 20 F sheath (Figure 4). The device was partially distorted and could be retracted into the right common iliac artery. Once positioned into the common iliac artery, the patient underwent open retrieval via a right sided Rutherford Morris incision.Peripheral pulses were present at the end of the retrieval and no distal angiogram was performed. However, the postsurgical course was complicated by bilateral lower limb claudication. This was the result of nonocclusive embolism to the tibial vessels requiring surgical thrombectomy after attempted percutaneous aspiration. No metal was present in the retrieved tissue which was thought to be chronic thrombus and fibrin detached off the device during attempted withdrawal into the sheath.The patient was subsequently commenced on apixaban with no recurrent thromboembolic complications during 12 months’ follow-up.Percutaneous device closure of the patent foramen ovale represents a therapeutic option for prevention of paradoxical emboli when considering the aetiology of cryptogenic stroke. Orthopnoea-platypnoea [7], decompression illness [8], and migraine [9, 10] have also been treated with this percutaneous technique. Procedural complications are uncommon, with PFO closure considered less technically challenging when compared to atrial septal defect closure. While complications such as cardiac perforation, arrhythmia, and air embolization are common to both PFO and ASD device closure, device embolism is rare in PFO closure cases. Imaging of the tissue margins in ASD closure is essential for device sizing and placement; when an ASD has inadequate tissue rims, device positioning may be problematic with an accompanying risk of device embolization. In addition, the desire to avoid device oversizing to prevent the complications related to device erosion may result in selecting a smaller device than necessary which may also predispose to device embolization. These issues are specific to ASD closure and are therefore not encountered in PFO closure.When septal occlusion device embolization is encountered following percutaneous ASD closure, a number of strategies to facilitate percutaneous retrieval are recognized [11]. The use of a large caliber vascular sheath to allow device removal is recommended; creating a notch in the sheath tip may further facilitate device retraction into the vascular sheath. In order to appropriately compress the device and retract it into the sheath, retrieval requires snaring of the locking mechanism on the right atrial disc. This can be achieved typically with a gooseneck snare [12]. Difficulty may be encountered when the device embolizes into the left heart, as negotiating the aortic and mitral valves may be problematic. In this case, despite snaring the device appropriately in the abdominal aorta, it could not be retrieved into a large caliber sheath due to inability of the device to deform, likely reflecting the late timing of retrieval attempt. Furthermore, the lack of ability to deform the device may predispose to device fracture and contribute to distal embolization as encountered in this example.The mechanism of device embolization is unclear. The device embolized into the left heart, the Amplatzer 30 mm fenestrated atrial septal defect occluder, has a 30 mm disc on the right atrial aspect, compared to 25 mm on the Amplatzer 35 mm PFO occlusion device. The use of the fenestrated ASD device in this case should theoretically reduce the risk of device embolization into the left heart. The device position was confirmed prior to release with the device advanced and then retracted while maintained on the delivery cable; it is possible that the device was partially dislodged at this stage. It is fortuitous that there was no left heart outflow obstruction or features of arrhythmia noted with device embolization.Percutaneous PFO closure is an important therapeutic option in the treatment of cryptogenic stroke. Procedural complications are fortunately rare. This case highlights that the possibility of device embolization is not limited to ASD device closure, noting that no cases of device embolization were reported in the PROTECT trial. Importantly, in cases of late recognition of device embolization, the operator should be aware of the inability of these devices to retract and compress as they would when initially deployed which has implications for the potential for percutaneous retrieval.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Absence of Left Circumflex Artery: A Rare Congenital Disorder of Coronary Arteries
Department of Internal Medicine, Temple University/Conemaugh Memorial Hospital, 1086 Franklin Street, Johnstown, PA 15905,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Noman Ahmed Jang Khan; gro.hguamenoc@nahknReceived 27 October 2016; Revised 10 February 2017; Accepted 20 March 2017; Published 16 April 2017Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2017 Saad Ullah et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Congenital absence of left circumflex artery is a rare occurrence and very few cases have been reported in literature. It is a benign incidental finding; however some patients present with sudden onset chest pain mimicking acute coronary syndrome often resulting in detection of this rare anatomy on coronary angiography. Coronary computed tomography angiography is a relatively new noninvasive imaging modality which can be used to confirm this suspicion and diagnose this unique morphology reliably. Coronary artery anomalies are the second most common cause of sudden cardiac deaths among young athletes, with an overall prevalence of about 0.3% to 5.6% among the general population [1]. Congenital absence of left circumflex artery (LCX) is a rare anatomical defect which is invariably associated with right dominant circulation. Patients with congenital absence of LCX can present with variable symptoms ranging from dyspnea on exertion to acute onset myocardial infarction. In this article, we describe a case of a 58-year-old female presenting with exertional dyspnea who underwent stress test which was positive for ischemia in left anterior descending (LAD) territory. Coronary angiography was suspicious for absent LCX which was later confirmed with the gold standard, coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).A 58-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department from her primary care physicians office for the evaluation of exertional dyspnea and chest tightness for the last six months. She had remote history of hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypothyroidism. Physical examination revealed a well-nourished obese female with a pulse of 56 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/72 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and peripheral arterial oxygen saturation of 96%. Cardiovascular examination revealed regular S1 and S2 heart sounds with no additional heart sounds or murmurs. Initial 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia, normal axis with no ischemic changes. Routine blood work including cardiac enzymes and chest radiography was also within normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function with ejection fraction of 65% with mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Pharmacologic stress test with nuclear imaging revealed medium size area of reversible moderate intensity ischemia in the base to the distal anterior wall suggestive of significant stenosis of LAD territory. Coronary angiography revealed a long left main (Figure 1), normal LAD and absence of LCX with super-dominant RCA (Figures 2 and 3 and video 1; see Supplementary Material available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/8710135) and no obstructive lesion of the coronaries. Left ventriculography was normal with an ejection fraction of 55%. Aortography was also performed which did not reveal any anomalous origin of LCX. CCTA was ordered to confirm the suspicion which revealed absence of left circumflex artery (Figure 4) and a right dominant circulation (Figure 5). CT pulmonary angiogram was also performed which failed to reveal anomalous origin of LCX from pulmonary arteries.Congenital absence of left circumflex coronary artery is an extremely rare anomaly with a reported incidence between 0.003% and 0.067% [1]. More commonly encountered anomalies involving this artery include LCX originating from proximal right sinus of valsalva, often sharing a common ostium with RCA, or as a proximal branch of right coronary artery [1]. Complete absence results from agenesis of LCX in the left atrioventricular groove. In this condition, lateral wall of the left ventricle is supplied by a super-dominant right coronary artery or occasionally by a multiple diagonal branches of LAD [1, 2]. It is an incidental benign finding on coronary angiography. However, it can present with significant clinical symptoms in up to 20% of the cases. Most of the patients present with exertional chest pain. One hypothesis that can explain exertional symptoms is steal phenomenon. This phenomenon results from increased metabolic demands in the LCX territory resulting in ischemic changes in LAD or RCA territories mimicking an acute coronary event [1, 2]. Varela et al. [3] reported a case of a 52-year-old male with congenital absence of LCX who presented with 90% stenosis of super-dominant RCA resulting in inferolateral and posterior wall myocardial infarction. Although anomalous origin of LCX has been associated with accelerated atherosclerosis because of abnormal wall stress, mechanical trauma, and abnormal flow strain, the absence of LCX has not been associated with major cardiac events [3].The currently available diagnostic modalities for this rare entity include transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), and invasive angiography. The role of stress test as a screening tool for exertional chest pain is limited in case of coronary artery anomalies [4]. TTE has been compared to invasive angiography in detection of congenital coronary artery anomalies (CCAA). The incidence of CCAA on TTE was reported to be 0.17% as compared to 1.07% with invasive angiography which makes TTE a less favorable screening tool for detection of CCAA and warrants further testing necessary. Based on this incidence of CCAA on invasive angiography, the importance of coronary angiography cannot be undermined, although invasive angiography provides only a two-dimensional image when compared to three-dimensional CCTA [1]. Although cardiac MRI is also a noninvasive imaging modality which does not require use of contrast agent or radiation, its inability to visualize smaller coronary arteries limits its use for CCAA evaluation [1].CCAA are commonly detected incidentally on invasive coronary angiography or CCTA when the patient is being evaluated for suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). In appropriate clinical settings (symptomatic patients with low to intermediate risk for CAD who cannot exercise or cannot have pharmacologic nuclear stress test or have equivocal stress testing) because of noninvasive nature, safety, rapid acquisition of results, lower radiation exposure, better sensitivity, and more widespread availability CCTA is emerging as a reasonable first-line tool for evaluation of coronary anatomy to rule out CCAA [2, 5, 6]. Recently, American College of Cardiology also included CCTA as a first-line tool for known or suspected anomalies, provided appropriate criteria are used [5, 6]. Though, invasive angiography remains gold standard in patients with high pretest probability of CAD [6]. Ghadri et al. compared CCTA and invasive angiography for prevalence of coronary anomalies. The reported prevalence of coronary anomalies on noninvasive CCTA was 7.85% compared to 2.02% on invasive angiography () which highlights CCTA as an important tool for assessment of suspected coronary anomalies [5]. In a small series of 16 patients, CCTA detected 100% of coronary anomalies as compared to 53% of anomalies on invasive angiography further supporting its use as a better tool for coronary anomalies [5]. In addition, CCTA also offers highly accurate description of coronary anomalies because it can present a three-dimensional image and reliably delineate the origin, course, and termination of coronary arteries and their relationship to cardiac and noncardiac structures [2, 5].Because CCAA obscures the normal coronary anatomy and increases the risk for accidental damage to the anomalous vessels during bypass surgery and cardiac catheterization, it is imperative to identify CCAA before opting these cardiac procedures [3]. CCAA has been associated with sudden cardiac deaths in young population particularly athletes which highlights the importance of early diagnosis [5].There is no specific treatment for absent LCX but it is decisive to differentiate 100% occluded LCX from absent LCX to avoid accidental damage to the LCX and choose appropriate revascularization approach if ischemia is detected [3].Congenital absence of LCX is an uncommon coronary vasculature pattern often detected incidentally during various cardiac imaging studies, usually on cardiac catheterization or coronary computed tomography angiography. Physicians should be aware and be able to identify this rare entity particularly in patients undergoing bypass surgery to ensure adequate reperfusion of myocardium and to avoid any iatrogenic injuries to these anomalous vessels during these procedures.The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.
Severe Dilatation of Coronary Artery Ostium Complicating Sinus of Valsalva Aneurysm: Differential Diagnosis and Review of the Literature
John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, NSW 2305,  AustraliaCorrespondence should be addressed to Nicholas Collins; ua.vog.wsn.htlaehenh@snilloc.salohcinReceived 11 January 2017; Accepted 26 March 2017; Published 13 April 2017Academic Editor: Renee BornemeierCopyright © 2017 Paul Bamford  and Nicholas Collins. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Coronary artery dilatation may be due to various aetiologies including congenital anomalies, atherosclerotic coronary disease, and Kawasakis disease. We describe a case characterised by apparent severe dilatation of the right coronary artery ostium in an asymptomatic male. Subsequent imaging and surgical intervention documented the presence of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm extending into the ostium of the right coronary artery. This represents an unusual manifestation of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. The underlying pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, role of surgical management, and outcomes are discussed.The aortic sinuses of Valsalva are areas of dilatation of the aortic root that arise from the three cusps of the aortic valve [1]. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is characterised by intrinsic abnormalities within the vessel wall producing aortic dilatation at the level of the coronary sinus. It is an uncommon congenital abnormality affecting less than 0.1% of the population [2]. The clinical presentation varies, with most symptomatic patients presenting following sinus of Valsalva aneurysm rupture, with consequent manifestations reflecting the involved sinus, size of aneurysm and the site of decompression [3]. Other risks associated with sinus of Valsalva aneurysm include compression of adjacent cardiac structures and aortic regurgitation [4].Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm most commonly involves the right coronary cusp, extending toward the right atrium and ventricle. In this case, the aneurysm extended into the coronary artery ostium. Coronary artery aneurysm, in contrast, is defined as coronary artery dilatation which exceeds the diameter of the largest normal coronary artery by 1.5 times. Coronary artery aneurysm is an uncommon clinical issue found in less than 5% of patients undergoing coronary angiography with giant coronary aneurysm considerably less frequent and defined as an artery greater than 2 cm in diameter and found in 0.02% of those undergoing coronary angiography [5, 6].We report an unusual manifestation of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm involving the ostium of the right coronary artery producing an appearance typical of a giant coronary aneurysm. Relevant issues in terms of the management in an asymptomatic patient are discussed, as are the potential alternative causes of coronary artery aneurysm.A 41-year-old Caucasian gentleman with a background of surgical closure of atrial septal defect aged 2 years old underwent routine echocardiography (surgical details unknown). The study was remarkable for the presence of a dilated right coronary ostium. No previous imaging was available for comparison, reflecting the remote nature of the patients’ previous surgery. There was no history of collagen vascular diseases. There was no suggestion of an episode typical of Kawasaki disease in childhood. The patient was asymptomatic with preserved effort tolerance. Physical examination was normal. Specifically, there was no evidence of cardiac failure and no murmur was noted on examination. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated aortic root dilatation at the level of the sinus of Valsalva (4.9 cm) with an appearance suggestive of right coronary artery ostial dilatation; the proximal ascending aorta measured 4.1 cm. The remainder of the echocardiogram was within normal limits. There was no evidence of resting ischaemia or previous infarction. Given these findings, CT coronary angiography was performed which demonstrated dilatation involving the right sinus of Valsalva extending into the ostium of the right coronary artery (Figure 1). The remainder of his right coronary artery and the left sided coronary arteries were of normal calibre and had minor irregularities only noted. Subsequent diagnostic cardiac catheterisation confirmed the appearance of severe dilatation of the right coronary ostium (Figure 2). There was no obvious stenosis noted distal to the aneurysmal dilatation.Due to concerns regarding possible subsequent coronary artery dissection, aneurysmal thrombus formation, and aneurysm rupture, the patient underwent surgical intervention.Following redo sternotomy, a transverse aortotomy was performed. Inspection confirmed a right coronary sinus of Valsalva aneurysm involving the right coronary ostium. A bovine pericardial patch was placed between the aortic annulus and sinotubular junction excluding the aneurysm. The true ostium of the right coronary artery was then anastomosed to a saphenous vein graft; the internal mammary artery was of insufficient length to serve as a conduit. The postoperative course was uneventful.Postoperative echocardiography was within normal limits. Repeat CT imaging confirmed bypass graft patency and no residual right coronary ostial dilatation (Figure 3).Congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm results from intrinsic deficiencies of elastic and muscular tissue at the junction of aortic media and annulus fibrosus of aortic valve. This leads to focal dilatation producing a diverticulum in the involved coronary sinus [7]. The incidence is four times greater in males and more commonly affects people of Asian origin [8]. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm typically occurs in the right sinus (75–90%), followed by noncoronary sinus (10–25%), with the remainder in the left coronary sinus [1]. Sundaram et al. established criteria to differentiate between acquired and congenital aneurysms, with acquired cases usually extending superiorly [9]. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is often associated with congenital defects particularly ventricular septal defect (30–50%), aortic insufficiency (20–30%), and bicuspid aortic valve (10%) and less commonly coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary stenosis, and atrial septal defects [10]. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm may also complicate degenerative diseases (atherosclerosis, connective tissue disorders, or cystic medial necrosis) and infectious aetiologies, such as infective endocarditis, tuberculosis, and syphilis [2, 3].When present, the appearance on imaging is typically of focal sinus dilatation adjacent to, rather than involving, the coronary ostia, producing a finger-like diverticulum [2, 7]. The aneurysm will typically extend toward either the right ventricle or right atrium, with extension into the ostium of the right coronary artery not previously reported.In this case, the unusual site of the sinus of Valsalva aneurysm created an appearance suggestive of an ostial giant coronary artery aneurysm. Giant coronary artery aneurysm, which is defined as areas of coronary artery dilatation >2 cm, occur extremely infrequently. There are various potential aetiologies for the development of coronary artery aneurysms. Primary congenital anomalies of coronary arteries are rare, seen in less than 1% of patients undergoing diagnostic angiography, with the majority of coronary aneurysms being the result of atherosclerotic disease. Less common causes include Kawasaki disease and disorders of connective tissue in a manner similar to sinus of Valsalva aneurysm.Clinical presentation, as in this case, may be asymptomatic prior to rupture and noted incidentally on imaging. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysms ruptures more frequently into the right ventricle and will typically produce symptoms, with the nature of symptoms depending on the site of rupture. Patients can present with chest pain, acute dyspnoea, palpitations, cardiogenic shock, or sudden death [11]. Once rupture has occurred, mean survival is 1 to 2 years. Death is usually due to congestive heart failure, but infective endocarditis has been reported as a cause of death in approximately 8% of cases [11].Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography can detect up to 75% of all patients with sinus of Valsalva aneurysm [12]. The gold standard for diagnosis is cardiac catheterisation with aortography, and oximetry analysis may add to the diagnostic yield; other imaging techniques include MRI and CT angiography [13].The decision to intervene on an asymptomatic, unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm depends upon aneurysm size and involvement of adjacent structures. Rigorous blood pressure control is recommended for all patients, with surgical repair when aortic root diameter exceeds 5 cm [14]. The association with aortic incompetence may mandate aortic valve replacement in addition to aneurysm repair. The serious complications that may complicate rupture, combined with the low perioperative death rates, have triggered some authors to recommend operating on asymptomatic patients [15]. Surgical closure is either by simple suture or by patch closure of the sinus of Valsalva with the recurrence rate varying from 0% to 20% [16]. With regard to coronary artery aneurysm, the indications for the surgical treatment include severe coronary stenosis, fistula formation, compression of adjacent cardiac chambers, and rapid increase in aneurysm size [17].The decision to proceed to surgical correction in cases of unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm remains difficult. In this case, due to concerns regarding the possibility of ischaemic complications from the unusual involvement of the coronary ostia and as there was no serial imaging to compare rate of growth, it was felt that surgical correction to prevent subsequent complications was appropriate.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Reversible Myocardial Injury and Intraventricular Thrombus Associated with Aluminium Phosphide Poisoning
1Laboratory of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Tangier, Abdelmalek Essaâdi University, Tangier,  Morocco2Department of Cardiology B, Ibn Sina Hospital, Mohammed V University, Rabat,  Morocco3Laboratory of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Rabat, Mohammed V University, Rabat,  MoroccoCorrespondence should be addressed to Abdelkader Jalil El Hangouche; moc.liamg@lilaj.ehcuognahleReceived 27 December 2016; Accepted 26 March 2017; Published 9 April 2017Academic Editor: Gianluca Di BellaCopyright © 2017 Abdelkader Jalil El Hangouche et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Aluminium phosphide (ALP) is widely used as a fumigant pesticide. In case of ALP poisoning, it is responsible for myocardial dysfunction, related to toxic myocarditis, and hemodynamic disorders. We report a case of a 28-year-old female who had intentionally ingested ALP and was admitted with cardiogenic shock. The transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) at the time of admission showed severe global myocardial hypokinesia with the presence of a giant left ventricular thrombus. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) revealed extensive toxic myocarditis with a left ventricular systolic dysfunction. All cardiac lesions were reversible after symptomatic treatment, within 6 months. We aim, by reporting this case, to evidence the complete reversibility of cardiac injury due to aluminium phosphide poisoning documented by transthoracic echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance.In Morocco, ALP poisoning is a serious healthcare problem [1], with a high mortality despite the progress of critical care. Most poisoned patients die from refractory cardiac shock [2].Few cases of reversible myocardial injury have been described in the literature. None of them has been evaluated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance [2].A 28-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with profuse sweating and dizziness, two hours following intentional ingestion of 1 tablet of aluminium phosphide, of which the confirmation was based on toxic ingestion history reported by the case’s relatives. She was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit and received gastric lavage.Physical examination at the time of admission revealed general malaise, pulse rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air (pulse oximetry).Chest X-ray was normal. The electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in AVr lead with ST-segment depression in inferior and anteroapical leads (Figure 1).Blood analysis revealed increased cardiac troponin I concentration of 17.5 ng/mL (50 times the ULN), glycemia of 0.90 g/dL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, and potassium of 3.8 mEq/L.One hour after admission, the patient developed signs of cardiogenic shock: hypotension (85/40 mmHg), sinus tachycardia (142 bpm), polypnea (28 cycles/min), and GCS score of 12.The patient was assisted by mechanical ventilation and intravenous inotropic and vasopressor agents (dobutamine 20 μg/kg/min, dopamine 20 μg/kg/min) with remarkable hemodynamic improvement 24 hours later.On the second day of intoxication, a transthoracic echocardiography was performed and objectified global hypokinesia of the left ventricule with an ejection fraction of 20% and an apical left ventricular thrombus extending to the anterior and anterolateral walls measuring 25  30 mm (Figure 2). The global longitudinal strain of the left ventricule was evaluated at −3.5% (Figure 3(a)). The right ventricule had a preserved systolic function (Figure 4).Regarding the echocardiographic findings and after clinical stabilization, an adjuvant treatment including diuretics (furosemide 40 mg per day), beta-blockers (carvedilol 12 increased to 25 mg twice daily), and spironolactone (25 mg increased to 50 mg per day) was introduced.Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed using a high performance 1.5-Tesla magnet. It showed an intramyocardial subepicardial signal anomaly in the anterior, inferoseptal, and anterolateral walls in T2 and in late gadolinium enhancement in T1-weighted images (after 10 min of gadolinium injection) suggesting acute toxic myocarditis (Figures 5(a) and 6). Additionally, a left intraventricular thrombus was found.On follow-up, there was progressive improvement of the hemodynamic, biologic, electric, and echocardiographic parameters. Both the left ventricule ejection fraction and the global longitudinal strain increased, respectively, to 55% and to −13.5% (Figure 3(b)), after 25 days of ALP ingestion. Regression of the intraventricular thrombus, of the hyperintense signal in the anterior wall in T2 (Figure 5(b)), and of late gadolinium enhancement in inferoseptal, anterior, and anterolateral walls in T1-weighted images (Figure 7) was confirmed by CMR control in two months.The patient remains asymptomatic at one-year follow-up.ALP is one of the most abused suicidal chemical agents in Morocco. It is marketed as dark gray tablets of 3 g, consisting of aluminium phosphide (56%) and ammonium carbamate (44%) [3].When it comes in contact with gastric hydrochloric acid or with atmospheric moisture, ALP releases a lethal phosphine gas [4].It is a mitochondrial toxin that causes depression of cardiac contractility, secondary to toxic myocarditis, and hemodynamic disorders.The accurate mechanism of cardiotoxicity of ALP is not well defined [5]. It includes corrosive action of phosphine, inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase, and formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals [6]. Indeed, indicators of oxidative stress reach peak levels within 48 h of exposure to the poison, approaching normalization on the fifth day [7].The clinical presentation depends on the amount of toxin ingested, the route of administration, and the time elapsed since exposure to the poison [8].Within a few minutes following the toxic ingestion, the patient develops symptoms of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and nervous systems deterioration. Then, a few hours later, symptoms of hepatic and renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation appear [9].The acute cardiovascular collapse secondary to phosphine-induced myocardial damage is the most common mode of presentation (60–100% of cases) [8].Several studies noted electric abnormalities, as conduction disorders, cardiac arrhythmias, and nonspecific ST-T wave changes, resulting from focal myocardial necrosis and changes in membrane action potentials [9]. Singh et al. reported that electrocardiogram changes revert to normal pattern within 10–14 days in survivors [10].The transthoracic echocardiogram of our case showed an important reduction in the left ventricular systolic function with global severe hypokinesia. Similar cases have been reported with a significant decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction. Bhasin et al. demonstrated a similar pattern of global hypokinesia of the left ventricule walls in 80% of their cases. Elabbassi et al. had reported normalization of echocardiographic findings in aluminium phosphide poisoning survivors by the fifth day [11]. Concerning our case, the TTE control showed a gradual improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction by the 14th day.To our knowledge, we are reporting the first case of left intraventricular thrombus of ALP poisoning.Cardiovascular magnetic resonance, a noninvasive, nonradiating technique, has been successfully used in the evaluation of both ischemic and nonischemic heart diseases. The ability to detect early myocardial changes missed by other imaging techniques, using tissue characterization, makes CMR an excellent diagnostic tool for early and detailed assessment of cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, CMR is the best noninvasive tool currently used for the detection of myocarditis. It has become actually the leading noninvasive imaging modality of myocarditis. The consensual use of the 3 criteria “Lake Louise Criteria” (signal intensity increase in T2-weighted images “edema,” early gadolinium enhancement in T1-weighted images “hyperemia,” and late gadolinium enhancement in T1-weighted images “necrosis and fibrosis”) has standardized the CMR protocol for myocarditis diagnosis [12].In our case, CMR showed myocardial edema in the T2-weighted images and myocardial areas of late gadolinium enhancement in the early phase. Follow-up CMR in two months showed favourable evolution with regression of the above finding. Furthermore, CMR provided valuable information about the systolic function of both right and left ventricles and the left intraventricular thrombus. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing finding of CMR in ALP ingestion.Since there is no specific antidote to ALP poisoning, the management of ALP intoxication remains primarily supportive care. The use of different therapeutic modalities was reported in the literature with varied degrees of success, including magnesium sulphate [13], N-acetyl cysteine [14], triiodothyronine [15], intra-aortic balloon pump [16], and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as an assist device [8].The majority of poisoned patients die despite intensive medical care [8]. However, our patient survived with no sequelae and remind free of symptoms at one-year follow-up because of symptomatic treatment.Myocardial injury following ALP poisoning is responsible for high mortality, mainly due to hemodynamic failure attributable to toxic myocarditis [3]. However, this injury could be reversible few days after intensive medical care as shown in our case. That underlines the interest in the use of transthoracic echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance to track the progress of myocardial dysfunction and look for thrombotic complications in the early phase of ALP intoxication.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest concerning this article.
Surgical Repair of Subacute Right Ventricular Perforation after Pacemaker Implantation
1Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Omura Municipal Hospital, 133-22 Kogashima-machi, Omura, Nagasaki 856-8561,  Japan2Department of Cardiology, Omura Municipal Hospital, 133-22 Kogashima-machi, Omura, Nagasaki 856-8561,  JapanCorrespondence should be addressed to Takeshi Oda; pj.mocedaj@adoReceived 18 January 2017; Accepted 30 March 2017; Published 6 April 2017Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2017 Takeshi Oda et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We report an 84-year-old woman who presented with right ventricular perforation 4 days after pacemaker implantation for syncope due to sick sinus syndrome. Median sternotomy revealed no pericardial effusion, but the pacing lead had penetrated the right ventricle and pericardium. When the pleura was opened, the tip of the lead was seen in the visceral pleura. The lead was cut in the pericardial cavity and extracted from the left subclavian wound together with the generator. The right ventricular perforation was sutured and a temporary pacing lead was placed on the right ventricular wall intraoperatively. Ten days after the surgery, a new pacemaker lead was placed in the ventricular septum via the right axillary vein. Right ventricular perforation is a rare complication after pacemaker implantation. Typically, it occurs at the time of implantation or within 24 hours after implantation. In the present case, the perforation of the right ventricle which needed urgent surgery occurred 4 days after implanting the pacing lead at the right ventricular apex. Great care should have been taken not to overlook this life-threatening complication even more than 24 hours after pacemaker implantation.Cardiac perforation by a pacing lead is rare, but life-threatening complication of pacemaker implantation usually presents within 24 hours of implantation and is uncommon after that. This complication tends to be more frequent when the tip of the pacing lead is placed at the right ventricular (RV) apex rather than the ventricular septum [1]. Independent predictors of cardiac perforation after pacemaker implantation were reported to be the use of a temporary pacemaker, helical screw-in leads, and oral steroid therapy [2]. The options for treating this complication can be divided into surgical or percutaneous therapy. We report an elderly woman who presented with RV perforation by the pacing lead. After the lead was extracted surgically, the tip of a new permanent pacemaker lead was placed at the ventricular septum via the right axillary vein.An 84-year-old woman with a history of syncope was referred to a general hospital by her primary doctor. Sick sinus syndrome was diagnosed and a ventricular demand pacemaker was implanted via the left axillary vein. The tip of the implanted lead (5076-52 cm, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) was a screw type. The lateral chest X-ray film obtained just after pacemaker implantation demonstrated that the tip of the lead was in the correct position (Figure 1(a)) and the pacemaker threshold was normal. Two days after implantation, she complained of the sudden onset of pain in the left precordial region. On the fourth day after implantation, a bulge appeared in the left sixth intercostal space at the site of the pain. A lateral chest radiograph obtained on the same day demonstrated displacement of the pacemaker lead (Figure 1(b)). Transthoracic echocardiography did not identify a pericardial effusion, but the position of the lead tip could not be seen accurately. Computed tomography (CT) confirmed penetration of the lead though the RV into the subcutaneous tissues of the left thoracic cavity (Figure 2). There was no pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. The patient was sent to our hospital for emergency treatment. Because transvenous removal of the pacing lead was thought to be risky, surgical removal and RV repair were performed. Median sternotomy was chosen as the approach because it would be easy to establish cardiopulmonary bypass if required. There was no pericardial effusion, but the pacing lead was seen protruding through the anterior wall of the RV apex and penetrating the pericardium (Figure 3). When the left pleural cavity was opened, the pacing lead was found to be embedded in the anterior visceral pleura, but the left lung was not injured in agreement with preoperative CT findings. A purse string suture was placed around the lead in the RV wall and a pledgetted mattress suture was added for reinforcement. Then the part of the lead protruding from the RV was grasped with forceps and cut in the pericardial cavity. Next, the pacing lead and generator were extracted from the left subclavian wound without any resistance. At the same time, the purse string suture and then the mattress suture were tied in this order, and the remaining part of the lead was extracted from the pleura with little resistance. There was no bleeding at the site where the lead had pierced the pleura. A temporary pacing wire was placed on the RV wall intraoperatively. Ten days after surgery, a new permanent pacemaker was inserted, with the tip of the lead being placed at the ventricular septum via the right axillary vein without any problems.The incidence of perforation of the heart by the pacing lead after pacemaker implantation ranges from 0.1% to 0.8% [3]. While this complication is rare, it may be fatal if discovered too late. Most perforations manifest within 24 hours after pacemaker implantation [4]. In the present patient, the tip of the lead was correctly positioned in the lateral chest X-ray film obtained just after implantation, but the lead tip had obviously advanced outside the heart by the fourth day. Symptoms of cardiac perforation vary, including extracardiac muscle stimulation, chest pain, shortness of breath due to pneumothorax, and hemothorax, hemopneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and/or pericardial tamponade [5]. Our patient started to complain of anterior chest pain on the second day after implantation, suggesting that the tip of the lead had gradually advanced to reach the pleura on that day. At surgery, the screw tip was found embedded in the intercostal subcutaneous tissue. If treatment had been delayed further, the skin might have been penetrated, resulting in infection.There are two options for the management of ventricular perforation by a pacemaker lead, which are surgical or transvenous procedures. According to a review of 25 patients by Refaat et al. [5], the lead was extracted surgically in 14 cases and was managed transvenously in 11 cases. Severe complications occurred in two of the 11 patients receiving transvenous management, with one patient dying 10 days after lead extraction [6] and the other developing pericardial tamponade after transvenous lead extraction that required pericardiocentesis [7]. Although surgical extraction is more invasive than transvenous management, the surgical option seems to be safer. When surgery is performed, median sternotomy is more common than left anterior thoracotomy as the approach. Indeed, the left anterior thoracotomy is less invasive and has the advantages in avoiding mediastinitis or adhesion after the operation. However, we chose median sternotomy because it is the best approach for repairing RV perforation and damage to adjacent structures, we believe. It is also easy to establish cardiopulmonary bypass in an emergency when median sternotomy is chosen.Amara et al. reported that there was a higher risk of cardiac perforation in thin elderly female patients, as well as patients on anticoagulants or steroids [7]. Our case was a thin elderly female patient, but she was not taking anticoagulants or steroids.A change in the pacing threshold can be a sign of RV perforation by the pacemaker lead. While a chest X-ray film is convenient for detecting displacement of the lead, CT should subsequently be performed for accurate diagnosis if RV perforation seems likely.To reduce the risk of RV perforation, placing the tip of the lead at the ventricular septum is recommended rather than implantation in the RV apex or free wall. This is because the ventricular septum is typically thicker than either the RV apex or free wall, and even if a pacing lead penetrates the septum the tip will remain in the left ventricular chamber.RV perforation is a rare, but potentially fatal, complication of pacemaker implantation. It usually manifests within 24 hours, but our patient presented four days after implantation. This case emphasizes that careful postoperative observation is necessary, even if the pacing lead is positioned correctly. To avoid RV perforation, implantation of the pacemaker lead at the ventricular septum seems to be safer than selecting the RV apex or free wall.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.The authors are grateful to Yoko Motomura for her assistance in preparing the manuscript.
Life-Threatening Hemopericardium Associated with Rivaroxaban

The use of this medication has expanded over the recent years with resultant expansion of side effect profile. We present a case of a 56-year-old female who presented with shortness of breath and chest pain 12 weeks after starting rivaroxaban for left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. She was later diagnosed with spontaneous hemopericardium requiring pericardial fluid drainage. Rarer side effects like this will be encountered more often with the increasing use of novel oral anticoagulants. The clinicians should be cognizant of this entity among patients with shortness of breath and chest pain for timely diagnosis and intervention.Rivaroxaban is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved novel oral anticoagulant for treatment of venous thromboembolism and for stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The use of rivaroxaban has been in the rising trend because of its ease of use as it does not require periodic monitoring. This increasing use has led to a rise in the observed side effects. Many bleeding side effects such as intracranial, gastrointestinal, or retroperitoneal bleeding have been associated with rivaroxaban [1].Spontaneous hemopericardium with cardiac tamponade due to rivaroxaban, however, is a rare entity and only 4 cases have been reported so far [1–4]. Here we report a case of a 56-year-old female who presented with spontaneous hemopericardium secondary to rivaroxaban use.A 56-year-old female with a history of pulmonary embolism, myotonic dystrophy, and complete heart block on pacemaker presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset shortness of breath and substernal chest pain radiating to the back. There was no history of fever, chills, cough, sore throat, or chest trauma. Her history was negative for any gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, or neurological symptoms. She was taking rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for deep vein thrombosis of the left axillary vein diagnosed 7 weeks ago. There was no prior history of tuberculosis, chest irradiation, or chemotherapy. She had a history of pulmonary embolism in 2007 for which she was on coumadin for a year. She had a biventricular pacemaker placed in 2008 for complete heart block induced nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Complete heart block was diagnosed at the same time and was believed to be secondary to myotonic dystrophy. The pacemaker device reached elective replacement indicator and was replaced with a Medtronic Protecta D314TRG device in 3/2012. She was on Tylenol 500 mg as needed for back pain, levocetirizine 5 mg twice daily for seasonal allergies, and rivaroxaban and zolpidem 5 mg nightly as needed. The above-listed medications do not have p-glycoprotein altering activity or CYP3A4/5 or CYP2J2 inhibiting activity [2, 5]. The past surgical history and family history were unremarkable.In the ED, her blood pressure was 78/48 mm Hg, pulse 106/minute, temperature 36.5°F, and respiratory rate 18/min with saturation of 87%. Her height and weight were 1.7 m and 180 lbs, respectively. Cardiac examination was normal. Chest examination was significant for bibasilar rales. Electrocardiogram revealed ventricular paced rhythm. There was no associated electrical alternans. Lab tests revealed negative troponin, INR of 1.3, and PTT of 28 s. Complete blood count and basic metabolic profile were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) on chest showed no pulmonary embolism but revealed a large hyperdense pericardial effusion (Figure 1). Echocardiogram showed moderate-sized circumferential effusion with a swinging heart consistent with pericardial effusion (prior echo 4 years ago showed no pericardial effusion) (Figure 2). Inferior vena cava was dilated with no respiratory collapse and right ventricle outflow tract collapsed in diastole. With the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, emergency subxiphoid pericardial window was performed and a total of 300 mL of bloody pericardial fluid was drained. Hemostasis was achieved and was satisfactory. Transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed emptying of the collection as well as improved cardiac function. There was immediate improvement in her hemodynamic status. Postprocedure images showed complete resolution of the effusion. Further etiologic workup was unrevealing. Pericardial fluid culture was negative with normal cytology. Pericardial tissue biopsy was negative for malignancy. Thyroid and liver function tests were normal. ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-saccharomyces cerevisae antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody, C3, C4, and anti-liver-kidney-muscle antibody were negative making the autoimmune cause unlikely. Myotonic dystrophy was considered to be an unlikely cause of her hemopericardium as pericardial involvement has not been reported with it [6]. In addition, her previous echo was negative for pericardial effusion. There was no temporal relation to the axillary vein DVT and the pacemaker lead implantation as CT scan done in 2013 and echocardiogram done in 2015 mentioned a normal pericardium with appropriately implanted leads. Intraoperatively, there was no mention of pacemaker lead induced pericardial perforation. Further hospital course, unfortunately, was complicated by healthcare associated pneumonia with septic shock and multiorgan failure. The autopsy was not done.Rivaroxaban inhibits factor Xa and prothrombinase. This increases the propensity for bleeding in rivaroxaban users; however, the tendency for pericardial bleeding per se is unknown. Rivaroxaban has been approved for prophylaxis of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, treatment and prophylaxis of DVT and PE, and prophylaxis of DVT following hip or knee replacement surgeries. The FDA approval of rivaroxaban for the above indications is supported by 3 trials: ROCKET AF trial, Bleeding Events in the Pooled Analysis of EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies, and EINSTEIN extension clinical study. In these trials, a total of 16326 patients received rivaroxaban and the major bleeding reported was intracranial and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. There was a decreased risk of intracranial bleeding and an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients on rivaroxaban compared to warfarin. Rivaroxaban had a statistically insignificant higher rate of major bleeding. In the Bleeding Events in the Pooled Analysis of EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies, intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, and intraarticular bleeding were observed, while in the EINSTEIN extension clinical study, gastrointestinal bleeding and menorrhagia were observed [5].Hemopericardium, however, was not reported in any of these studies making it a rare form of lethal major bleeding side effect. Postmarketing experience has not identified it as an adverse effect either [5]. It might be due to the fact that this drug is relatively new and it is possible that increasing use of this drug might have led to the occurrence and detection of rarer adverse effect like spontaneous hemopericardium which were not detected in the clinical trials and postmarketing experience. Spontaneous hemopericardium in our patient was attributed to rivaroxaban after a thorough workup to exclude all the major etiologies [2–4, 6]. Spontaneous hemopericardium has also been associated with other novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) like dabigatran and apixaban [7–10]. Hemopericardium has been reported with vitamin K antagonists but no studies comparing NOACs to these medications have been done yet [11].Evaluation for pericardial effusion with an echocardiogram in a patient on rivaroxaban who presents with unexplained shortness of breath seems to be a reasonable recommendation we can make. As echo has a very good sensitivity and can detect as low as 20 mL of pericardial fluid, it can be considered a reliable diagnostic modality in these patients [12]. The biggest concern with the widespread use of rivaroxaban is that it does not have an approved reversal agent or lab test to predict its anticoagulant effect [6]. It is reasonable to stop the responsible anticoagulant, assess the risks and benefits, and resume another anticoagulant if needed [8].Rivaroxaban, like other anticoagulants, is associated with increased bleeding risk. Spontaneous hemopericardium, including cardiac tamponade due to novel oral anticoagulants, is a rare side effect and only few cases have been reported so far. Clinicians should be aware of this little known but life-threatening adverse effect of rivaroxaban, so that they can identify these patients early and institute appropriate interventions which can be lifesaving. Whether periodic echocardiogram should be done in these patients to identify early pericardial effusion needs further research.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Peeled Guidewire Coating with Debulked Plaque Obtained by Directional Coronary Atherectomy

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Percutaneous directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) is a plaque debulking method performed in Japan, and recently a renewed DCA device has been launched. We present a case with a tight left anterior descending lesion undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with application of DCA. After several sessions of DCA, white plaques accompanied by green, stringed materials were obtained from the device; some materials were considerably long (approximately 15 mm in length). A drug-eluting stent was subsequently implanted, and the procedure was completed successfully without any complications. The extracted plaques and artificial materials were pathologically examined, and no inflammatory changes were detected on plaques adjacent to the material. Assessing pathological findings and structure of the DCA catheter, the obtained artificial materials were considered as peeled guidewire, possibly resulting from the friction between the guidewire and metallic bearing in the housing of DCA catheter. Of note, this phenomenon has been recognized even in other DCA cases in which guidewires of the other kind are used. We report this phenomenon for the first time, warning of theoretically possible distal embolization of artificial materials caused by any debulking devices.Percutaneous directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) had been utilized dating back to late 1980s as an adjunctive procedure during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the reduction of plaque volume, especially for bifurcation or ostium lesions [1, 2]. However, the advent of coronary stents including drug-eluting stents overwhelmed the benefit of DCA. Moreover, given the technical expertise required for the DCA procedure which further reduced the clinical indication, DCA had gone out of use [3]. Nevertheless, a renewed DCA device has been recently launched in Japan, and potential benefits have been shown in the integrated strategy using DCA followed by stenting in selected populations [1]. We report a case treated with use of the renewed DCA device (Atherocut, NIPRO, Tokyo, Japan), in which artificial materials that potentially belonged to a guidewire coating were obtained as well as atheromatous plaque.A 73-year-old male with effort angina was referred to our hospital, and diagnostic coronary angiography revealed a tight stenosis in proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) (Figure 1(a)), which demonstrated a fractional flow reserve (FFR) of 0.68. Given the positive FFR and clinical symptom, PCI was indicated. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) revealed an eccentric fibrous plaque with mild calcification predominantly to the direction to myocardium. With the use of a 300 cm guidewire (Gland Slam, ASAHI INTECC CO. Nagoya, Japan), we performed IVUS-guided DCA. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show DCA catheter debulking targeted plaque. After 7 sessions of debulking, white plaques accompanied by green, stringed materials were obtained from the device (Figure 2). Some extracted artificial materials were considerably large, approximately 15 mm in length (Figure 2(b)); some were clumped and attached to plaques (Figures 2(c)-2(d)). The green, stringed, and tangled materials were speculated to be an artificial fragment of the guidewire coating to the eye balls. A drug-eluting stent was subsequently implanted with an optimal stent expansion, and this procedure was completed successfully without any complications. The extracted plaques and artificial materials were pathologically examined (Figure 3). Plaques were mainly fibrotic with partial hyalinization and myxoid changes. A few calcium deposits and cholesterol crystals were identified as well. There was no atheromatous change or intraluminal thrombus attached to the plaque. Green-colored materials consisted of cluster of fine granules, the colors of which were black in hematoxylin and eosin stain and blue by the polarizing microscope. Inflammatory changes were not detected within the plaque adjacent to the materials.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of peeled artificial materials obtained by the recently relaunched DCA device. DCA has potential advantage in reducing residual plaque volume with combined use of IVUS and the appropriate understanding, as well as in obtaining targeted plaque by tissue [4–6]. The complications of prior DCA device included coronary perforation, dissection, and deforming implanted stent [3, 7]; although DCA device has been renewed and the availability is limited to a specific country, this report is of potential importance for theoretically possible distal embolization of artificial materials caused by any debulking devices [8].DCA device cut plaques off by a fast rotating cutter, at approximately 6000 rpm, which is pushed on the coronary plaques by inflated balloon equipped to the DCA catheter. The renewed DCA catheter, in order to hold the axis of the cutter to the center of the device, mounts “a guidewire-supporting bearing” at the distal end of the cutter housing. As this metallic bearing tightly holds the guidewire, the friction between guidewire and the bearing is produced during cutting, which may have resulted in a peeling of the wire surface. These hypotheses are supported by the pathological examination, which revealed that there were no inflammatory changes found in the attachment of plaques and the materials, implicating that this phenomenon occurred inside the DCA catheter. In our case, the target plaque, which was pathologically a fibrous tissue, was effectively reduced without clinical complication; however, the extracted artificial material could have caused significant myocardial damage by distal embolization, considering the size of the materials that was approximately 15 mm in length. Of note, at our institution, this phenomenon has been recognized even in other DCA cases in which guidewires of the other kind are used (FLEXI-wire, Abbott Vascular Japan, Tokyo, Japan; ABYSS DCA support 300, Nipro, Osaka, Japan). This phenomenon is not uncommon; in the recently performed consecutive 10 cases treated by using this DCA device, foreign artificial materials (presumably wire-coating debris) were recognized in four cases by eye balls.Although the peeled materials have been confirmed inside the DCA devices in these cases, we could not cancel the possibility of distal embolization of these materials if they are prolapsed from the housing of debulking cutter. Given the specification of the device, the high rotational speed and tight wire bearing of the device, it might be difficult to have a complete solution to this phenomenon because wire coating is not likely to be tolerable to the friction. Nevertheless, potential improvement of wire coating or coaxial movement of the cutter along a guidewire may reduce this unfavorable phenomenon. Additionally, considering the possible mechanism of this phenomenon, the most efficient ways to prevent distal embolization would be to limit the number of cuts and to be cautious not to open the housing while the device is being withdrawn into the guiding catheter, keeping the nose-cone not filled up with obtained materials. Distal protection device could be an option in regard to minimization of the risk of distal embolization, yet the safety and effectiveness are not validated. Further studies are warranted to precisely investigate the mechanism of peeling and the adverse effects in clinical settings.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
Pulmonary Embolism and Intracardiac Type A Thrombus with an Unexpected Outcome
1Cardiology Department, Hospital Senhora da Oliveira, Guimarães,  Portugal2Escola de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade do Minho, Braga,  Portugal3Cardiology Department, Centro Hospitalar de Leiria, Leiria,  PortugalCorrespondence should be addressed to João Português; moc.liamg@seugutropmoaojReceived 16 November 2016; Accepted 23 February 2017; Published 2 April 2017Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2017 João Português et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Detection of right heart thrombi (RHT) in the context of pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) is uncommon (4–18%) and increases the risk of mortality beyond the presence of PE alone. Type A thrombi are serpiginous and highly mobile and are thought to be originated from large veins and captured in-transit within the right heart. Optimal management of RHT is still uncertain. A 79-year-old woman, with a history of recent total hysterectomy with adnexectomy and a Wells procedure, presented to the emergency department following an episode of syncope. Computed tomography revealed bilateral PE and the presence of a right atrial thrombus. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a free-floating type A thrombus in the right atrium, protruding into the right ventricle, and signs of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricle dysfunction. Considering the recent surgery and clinical stability, treatment with heparin alone was decided. Subsequent clinical improvement was observed and echocardiographic follow-up revealed complete thrombus dissolution and complete recovery of right ventricle function. Most authors recommend treatment of PE with RHT with thrombolysis or embolectomy followed by anticoagulation, although evidence is scarce. Individual risk of hemorrhage and operatory-related mortality should be taken into account when defining the treatment strategy especially when benefit is not firmly established.Venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism, is a common disease that carries significant morbidity and mortality. The presence of heart right thrombi (RHT) in the absence of atrial fibrillation, structural heart disease, or catheters in situ is rare and almost exclusively found in the presence of clinical manifestations of pulmonary embolism (PE). In view of the reported high mortality, it constitutes a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment. Although there are different treatment options for PE, the optimal management of right ventricular thrombi is still uncertain.We report a case of a patient with a free-floating type A thrombus with a favorable outcome with a conservative approach and review the related literature [1].A 79-year-old woman presented to the emergency department following an episode of syncope. She had undergone a total hysterectomy with adnexectomy and a Wells procedure for complete rectal prolapse 2 weeks before and had history of resting dyspnea in the previous week.Upon examination she was hypotensive (85/49 mmHg), tachycardiac (110 bpm), and tachypneic (25 bpm). Oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. The electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with no other changes. Fluid therapy was promptly initiated and the patient rapidly became normotensive.Urgent computed tomography angiography revealed bilateral PE (Figure 1) and dilatation of the right ventricle and suggested the presence of a long thrombus on the right atrium (Figure 2).Transthoracic echocardiography documented a big worm-like mass floating in the right atrium, protruding through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle in diastole (see video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/9092576). Severe dilatation of the right heart chambers (right ventricle: 41 mm), significant tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure: 58 mmHg) were also documented (Figures 3 and 4).Considering the high risk of hemorrhage with the recent surgery and the patient’s clinical stability, conservative treatment was decided with no thrombolytic therapy or surgical embolectomy. Anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin was started immediately with a 5000 IU bolus, followed by an infusion of 18 IU/Kg targeting a therapeutic aPTT level between 46 and 70 seconds. At admission in the cardiac intensive care unit she presented mild dyspnea at rest with no other symptom and her blood pressure was stable (systolic BP > 100 mmHg).The following day the patient’s symptoms had improved, with no resting dyspnea, although the echocardiography assessment showed no improvements. On the third day the patient became completely asymptomatic. The echocardiographic evaluation on the fourth day of hospitalization showed no signs of intracardiac thrombus, and partial recovery of right ventricle function with free-wall hypokinesis and mild tricuspid regurgitation with no signs of pulmonary hypertension was observed.At discharge (9 days after admission) the transthoracic echocardiography was unremarkable, with normal right ventricle function (Figure 5). The patient was discharged from the hospital on anticoagulation with warfarin.In the setting of PE, echocardiography is currently indicated for the diagnostic work-up in suspected high risk PE and for prognosis assessment in intermediate-risk patients [2]. Echocardiography is considered the examination of choice for the detection and morphology assessment of RHT, although computed tomography has also been shown to be an accurate diagnostic tool in this setting [3]. Bedside echocardiography is an invaluable tool in the management of these patients, allowing serial assessment of right ventricular chambers size and function and of changes in thrombus size or morphology.Despite the increase in the diagnosis with the widespread use of echocardiography, free-floating RHT are still considered a rare finding. They can be identified in less than 4% of unselected patients with PE, but their prevalence may reach 22% in high risk patients [3–6].Three patterns of RHT have been described. Type A thrombi are morphologically serpiginous, highly mobile, and associated with deep vein thrombosis and PE. It is hypothesized that these clots embolize from large veins and are captured in-transit within the right heart. Type B thrombi are nonmobile and are believed to form in situ in association with underlying cardiac abnormalities while type C thrombi elicit intermediate characteristics of both type A and type B [7]. Our patient presented a serpiginous thrombus moving through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle compatible with a type A thrombus.Mobile RHT are associated with RV dysfunction and higher early mortality beyond the presence of PE alone. The presence of RHT at the time of acute PE was found to predict all-cause death, PE-related death, and recurrent venous thromboembolism, particularly in patients without haemodynamic compromise [6].A meta-analysis including all reported cases in the literature up to 2002 reported a 27% mortality rate, with 100% mortality in untreated patients [8]. Observational studies also report high early mortality rates, ranging from 29% to 50% [4, 9, 10]. More recent meta-analysis data suggest a slightly lower mortality rate of 16.7% [11].However, it is still unclear whether RHT are a direct cause or just an indicator of adverse outcomes. In the Right Heart Thrombi European Registry, short-term prognosis was associated with clinical and haemodynamic consequences of PE and not RHT characteristics such as size, morphology, or mobility [12].In view of the reported high mortality, the coexistence of PE with RHT is regarded as a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment. Contemporary treatment modalities for PE vary, ranging between heparin alone, thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapy, and surgical embolectomy. However, the optimal management of PE associated RHT remains unclear owing to the low number of cases and the lack of randomized controlled trials.The haemodynamic benefits of thrombolysis in patients with PE are well established and it is currently recommended for high risk and selected intermediate-high risk patients [2]. Thrombolytic treatment has the potential to dissolve the clots at three locations: the intracardiac thrombus, the pulmonary embolus, and the venous thrombosis. The benefit of using systemic thrombolysis can also be attributed to its easy availability, rapid bedside initiation, and simplicity of treatment. Good outcomes with thrombolysis were reported in some small series of patients with RHT [13, 14]. Torbicki et al. proposed that the favorable result after thrombolysis could be related to the shorter delay between the presumed onset of symptoms and hospitalization in patients where pulmonary embolism was associated with mobile clots in the right heart (2.2 versus 4.5 days) [4]. In one case series, half of the clots disappeared within 2 hours of thrombolysis, whereas the remainder disappeared within 12 to 24 hours. This delayed disappearance of the thrombi supports the decision to defer surgery after thrombolysis until at least 24 hours [13].Surgical embolectomy with exploration of the right heart chambers and pulmonary arteries under cardiopulmonary bypass is another treatment option [2]. However, it is not readily available in many centers and it carries the risk of inherent delay of a few hours, general anesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass, and the inability to remove coexisting pulmonary emboli beyond the central pulmonary arteries. It should be considered particularly for cases in which thrombolysis is contraindicated or if thrombolysis is ineffective or in patients with patent foramen ovale with potential for systemic embolization.Emerging catheter-directed therapies for PE include percutaneous catheter-directed thrombolysis or high-frequency ultrasound exposure near the surface of the clot; endovascular mechanical thrombectomy using fragmentation and a capture device; and endovascular aspiration of the clot directly from within the atrium, ventricle, or pulmonary arteries [15–17]. These methods are also promising in patients with RHT with some successful cases reported [18–21]. However evidence is still scarce and there is still a lack of general availability and expertise.Anticoagulation is recommended for virtually all PE patients and should be promptly initiated while awaiting the results of diagnostic tests [2]. In the presence of an intracardiac thrombus it can be used alone as first-line therapy or as an adjunctive following other interventions. The use of isolated parenteral anticoagulation is sometimes dismissed in patients with RHT because it is thought to be potentially hazardous as the thrombi may embolize to the already compromised pulmonary circulation, although thrombolysis may also pose similar risks [8]. However, its use as a first-line therapy in these patients is proposed in stable patients, especially when there is a high bleeding risk [9].Few studies have analyzed the differential impact on mortality of these therapies. Older meta-analysis data showed no differences among available treatment options [22]. More recently, Rose et al. reviewed 177 cases presenting with RHT described on literature and described an improved survival rate with thrombolytic therapy that was statistically significant when compared to either anticoagulation therapy or surgery [8].However, case series of consecutive patients comparing these therapeutic approaches failed to find significant differences on mortality, although the results are most likely limited by the small number of patients included [4, 9, 10]. More recent data using propensity scores to compare reperfusion therapy to anticoagulation alone found no significant difference in mortality and bleeding, with a higher risk of recurrence with reperfusion therapy [23].The presence of a right heart thrombus is rare, and it is unlikely that a randomized trial with two or three different treatment arms would be performed in the near future. Thus, choice of therapy is based on the physician’s discretion and clinical judgment and based on availability and patient factors which often preclude the development of one-size-fits-all treatment algorithms.In this case, a favorable course with complete thrombus dissolution and right ventricle function recovery was observed with a conservative approach with heparin alone. This highlights the importance of taking into account individual risk of hemorrhage and operatory-related mortality and considering less invasive strategies such as isolated anticoagulation in these patients.Although it is widely recognized as an ominous finding, the existing literature does not offer a clear consensus for management of PE with coexisting mobile intracardiac thrombus. Existing evidence suggests the superiority of thrombolysis over anticoagulation alone, and most authors advocate immediate treatment with thrombolysis and/or embolectomy followed by effective anticoagulation with heparin, even though there are no prospective randomized trials to support this decision. Percutaneous treatments may play an important role for the management of patients with RHT in the future, but evidence is still lacking.This case illustrates the difficulty in the management of such high risk patients in the absence of hard evidence and highlights the importance of taking into account individual risk of hemorrhage and operatory-related mortality when defining the treatment strategy. Avoiding high risk procedures should always be carefully considered when benefit is not firmly established (primum non nocere).The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We describe a case of a young male without stroke risk factors who presented with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness, left hand numbness, and left eye blurriness. CT scan of the head without contrast and diffusion-weighted MRI of the brain with contrast revealed an ischemic stroke in the right middle cerebral artery distribution. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed a mobile pedunculated mass on the posterior surface of the mitral valve. This mass was resected and pathology showed a cardiac papillary fibroelastoma (CPFE), which was determined to be the cause of the patient’s cardioembolic stroke. Further workup also found that patient had microcytic anemia secondary to β-thalassemia intermedia, a rare hematologic disorder due to defective hemoglobin synthesis. Recently, another case report suggested β-thalassemia major may underlie the pathogenesis of CPFE. β-Thalassemia major causes a state of chronic inflammation and endothelial damage, which can mediate CPFE formation. Based on literature review, this is the first case report of a CPFE in a patient with β-thalassemia intermedia. This hypothesis-generating case report calls attention to the need for elucidating the relationship between CPFE and β-thalassemia in future studies to better understand the diagnosis and management of a rare cardiac tumor.Primary tumors of the heart are rare, occurring at a frequency of 0.001–0.03% based on autopsy studies [1, 2]. Cardiac papillary fibroelastomas (CPFEs) are historically known as the second most common primary cardiac tumors after cardiac myxomas. However, more recent studies suggest that CPFEs may be the most common cardiac tumor due to increasing diagnosis with echocardiography [3]. CPFEs consist of a small, papillary, pedunculated, and avascular tumor covered by endothelium surrounded by a hyaline stroma [4], though some authors believe that CPFEs are hamartomatous instead of neoplastic [5, 6]. Most of CPFEs are found on the valvular endocardium of the aortic and mitral valves, followed by the tricuspid and pulmonary valves and nonvalvular sites scattered in the atria and ventricles [7]. Multiple CPFEs can also form at the same location [3].Although CPFEs are histologically benign and are usually asymptomatic, symptoms can occur when either the tumor itself or a thrombus embolizes. The most common clinical presentation is stroke or transient ischemic attack, followed by angina, myocardial infarction, sudden death, heart failure, syncope or presyncope, and systemic or pulmonary embolic events [7, 8]. Both transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) can be used to diagnose CPFE with high sensitivity and specificity [9]. On echocardiography, the tumor appears as a well-demarcated homogeneous round or oval structure and can appear “speckled” with stippling around the perimeter if the image quality is high [8, 9]. This report describes a case of a young male who presented with a cardioembolic stroke secondary to a CPFE diagnosed on TEE who was found to have β-thalassemia intermedia.The patient was a 29-year-old African American male without significant past medical history who presented to the emergency room with sudden weakness in his left lower extremity. While at work he suddenly felt lightheaded dizziness. Then, his left leg “gave out” while walking. Two days priorly, patient also had noted that his vision in his left eye suddenly became blurry, and his left hand clenched together uncontrollably and felt numb. Physical examination was normal except for mild loss of sensation in his left forearm. Troponin I was 0.196 and hemoglobin and MCV were 10.7 gm/dL and 70.8 fL, respectively. Urine drug screen was positive for cannabinoids. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with early repolarization changes. CT scan of the head without contrast showed loss of grey-white matter differentiation in the right insular cortex signifying a subacute ischemic stroke in the right middle cerebral artery distribution. He was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and statin and was admitted for further workup.The patient lacked significant cardiovascular risk factors that often cause ischemic stroke. He was young and normotensive and denied a family history of early cardiovascular disease. He smoked less than half a pack of cigarettes per day and used marijuana recreationally. He denied any IV drug use. He was generally active, with his most recent episode of prolonged immobilization being a six-hour car ride two weeks prior to presentation. He denied any past DVTs or a family history of hypercoagulability. The patient’s neurological exam returned to normal within 48 hours of hospital admission.For stroke workup, patient underwent CT angiogram of the head and neck, which was normal. MRI of the brain with contrast showed abnormal signal in the right parietal lobe and other areas of small bright signals in the temporal lobe, occipital white matter, and right cerebellum consistent with multiple subacute infarcts (Figure 1). Transesophageal echocardiogram showed an  mm pedunculated mass on the atrial aspect of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (Figure 2), suggesting either a cardiac tumor or a vegetation of infectious or noninfectious etiology. Endocarditis was considered less likely due to lack of fever, along with four sets of negative blood cultures. In terms of the risk for endocarditis, the patient only met one minor Duke criterion, which was having a vascular phenomenon such as thromboembolic event.The patient was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery and the lesion was resected three weeks later (Figure 3). Repeat TEE demonstrated the complete removal of the pedunculated mass (Figure 4). Pathology showed papillary structures lined by endothelium consisting of fibromyxoid stroma with dense areas of hyalinized stroma, confirming the diagnosis of a papillary fibroelastoma of the mitral valve (Figure 5). Fragments of this cardiac tumor were deemed the source of his cardioembolic ischemic stroke. After surgery, the patient was stable without further thromboembolic events or neurologic deficits. Hypercoagulable workup, including lupus anticoagulant, PT/PTT, anticardiolipin, homocysteine, and ANA, was negative. HIV serology was negative. Further workup of his microcytic anemia showed normal ferritin level of 197. Notably, on hemoglobin electrophoresis, Hgb A1 was decreased at 83.8% and Hgb F was increased at 13.2%, consistent with beta-thalassemia intermedia that was newly diagnosed.A stroke in a young and otherwise healthy individual without traditional risk factors presents an intriguing opportunity to investigate the cause of this clinical condition. Although CPFEs are rare and histologically benign, they should be managed with caution because they are a source of cardioembolic stroke [10]. Embolic strokes caused by arrhythmias and valvular diseases often require anticoagulation, but embolic strokes from CPFEs can be prevented through surgical resection of the tumor alone [8]. Surgical resection is the mainstay treatment and should be considered especially for CPFEs that are more than 10 mm in diameter, highly mobile, and associated with systemic embolization [11]. The outcomes following surgery are excellent: most valves retain their functionality and the tumors rarely recur [3]. Since CPFE has a curative management, understanding the pathogenesis of CPFE can guide disease diagnosis and prevent devastating neurological complications.While CPFE is classified as a cardiac tumor, its pathogenesis differs significantly from that of other solid tumors and remains controversial. Instead of being driven by mutational changes and genomic instability, CPFEs are thought to arise from a combination of nongenetic causes: endothelial damage, viral-induced growth, microthrombi aggregation, and hamartomatous origin [7]. One of the more widely discussed theories suggests hemodynamic stress of blood flow causes damage to the endocardium, and continued hemodynamic stress over time leads to the accumulation of successive fibrin layers within the tumor [9]. Clinical studies support this hypothesis, showing that a large proportion of patients with CPFEs have associated cardiac and valvular conditions that increase hemodynamic stress [9]. The observation that CPFEs developed after iatrogenic stress to the endocardium through cardiac surgery and thoracic irradiation further supports this hypothesis [12].More recently, a case report suggested a novel cause of damage to the endocardium in association with CPFEs in patient with β-thalassemia major [13]. β-Thalassemia, an inherited hemolytic disorder caused by the partial or complete inability to synthesize the β-chain in hemoglobin, is categorized into three groups based on the genetic alterations and clinical severity: major, intermedia, and minor. In the serum and plasma of patients with thalassemia, in vitro studies showed that there are elevated levels of endothelial adhesion proteins (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], E-selectin [ELAM-1], vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1], von Willebrand factor [VWF], and thrombomodulin) [14, 15]. These endothelial adhesion proteins are elevated in the setting of endothelial activation and damage as well as chronic inflammation, suggesting these two processes underlie the pathophysiology of β-thalassemia [16]. These same processes, like hemodynamic stress, can also contribute to the formation of CPFEs.In this case, this otherwise healthy patient did not have any cardiac or iatrogenic causes of increased hemodynamic stress. Based on literature review, this case is the second report that associates β-thalassemia with CPFE and is the first report specifically for β-thalassemia intermedia. While there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether his β-thalassemia contributed to the formation of the CPFE, this hypothesis-generating case calls attention to the need for elucidating the relationship between these two conditions in future studies.The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
Aborted Sudden Cardiac Death in a Female Patient Presenting with Takotsubo-Like Cardiomyopathy due to Epicardial Coronary Vasospasm

Catecholamine cardiotoxicity, metabolic disturbance, and coronary microvascular impairment have previously been proposed as underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, whereas myocardial stunning resulting from epicardial coronary artery vasospasm is not generally accepted as a cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The prognosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally more favourable compared to myocardial infarction; however, severe complications such as rupture of the LV and life-threatening arrhythmias may occur. Herein, we describe a case of an 84-year-old female, who presented with aborted sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation. Echocardiography suggested LV apical ballooning with severely impaired LV-function, so that takotsubo cardiomyopathy was suspected. However, coronary angiography revealed epicardial spasm of the left anterior ascending, which resolved after intracoronary injection of 0.2 mg nitroglycerine. Cardiac magnetic resonance exhibited subendocardial late enhancement and echocardiography showed normalization of LV dysfunction during follow-up. The patient was put on conservative treatment with nitrates and calcium inhibitors and ICD implantation were deferred. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, stress induced cardiomyopathy, or apical ballooning syndrome is a condition characterized by reversible myocardial dysfunction usually following a physical or emotional stress in the presence of nonobstructive epicardial arteries [1]. Myocardial dysfunction is typically located apically, although dysfunction of the mid-wall segments or basal segments have also been reported [2]. It mostly affects elderly women [3]. The clinical presentation has the hallmarks of an acute coronary syndrome, with patients describing acute chest pain, the ECG showing ischemic changes, blood tests revealing increased troponin levels, and cardiac imaging depicting regional wall motion abnormalities [4–6]. However, the clinical picture can vary greatly from mildly symptomatic patients to patients with cardiogenic shock and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias [7].Although several hypotheses were proposed for explaining the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, uncertainties remain regarding the pathogenesis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Increased sympathetic activation that leads to myocardial stunning, metabolic disturbances with increased oxidative stress at the level of the coronary endothelium, and disturbances of the coronary microcirculation were all described as possible pathomechanisms in this form of cardiomyopathy [8–10]. Coronary vasospasm was first thought to play a major role in the development of takotsubo cardiomyopathy [11]. However, the significance of vasospasm is currently rated differently in this context [12] and is rather not regarded as a central mechanism with takotsubo cardiomyopathy [7].In most patients, the left ventricular (LV) function recovers spontaneously, although more recent observations revealed an increased risk of complications associated to takotsubo cardiomyopathy similar to that seen in patients with typical acute coronary syndrome [13].We herein report the case of an 84-year-old female patient presenting with apical ballooning syndrome due to coronary vasospasm of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery.An 84-year-old female patient was referred to our department after aborted sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation. The patient had experienced severe first time chest pain during the last hours prior to admission. Shortly before her arrival to our hospital, she developed ventricular fibrillation that was successfully converted to normal rhythm after application of a 200 J electrical shock by the emergency physician. On admission in our intensive care unit, she was awake, oriented, and hemodynamically stable. The patient’s history revealed mild hypertension treated with a low-dose ACE-Inhibitor. No other cardiovascular risk factors were identified and no history of angina pectoris or exercise induced dyspnoea was reported. The ECG showed a sinus rhythm with T-wave inversion in the precordial leads (V1–V4). A bed-side echocardiography identified a severely reduced ejection fraction with an apical ballooning appearance of the LV. No signs of psychologic or physical stress were reported. The laboratory tests identified on admission elevated troponin levels (high sensitivity troponin = 102.7 ng/L) and increase white blood cells (13,000/μl) with normal C-reactive protein. No other pathological changes in laboratory tests were found on admission. A coronary angiography was performed within the same day that revealed a moderate stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery (dashed arrow in Figure 1(a)) as well as a localized spasm of the proximal LAD (white arrow in Figure 1(a)), which was reversible after intracoronary injection of 0.2 mg nitroglycerin (white arrow in Figure 1(b)).The patient was treated with aspirin, statin, selective ß-blocker (bisoprolol), nitrate, and calcium antagonists. In addition, intravenous therapy with diuretics was initiated. Repeated echocardiographic examinations showed a slowly improving LV function with persistent hypokinesia of the apex. At one week, the LV ejection fraction was moderately reduced (ejection fraction of 42%). During the monitoring period, no ventricular arrhythmias were noted. Two weeks after the coronary angiography, a cardiac MRI was performed. The result of the examination was suggestive of the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy with moderately reduced LV ejection fraction (Ejection fraction 44%), presence of myocardial edema in the apical region, and the presence of subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement in the apical region (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). The patient recovered well and could be discharged after 21 days in stable condition and without clinical symptoms such as angina or dyspnea. Due to the episode of ventricular fibrillation and incomplete recovery of the LV function she was discharged with a life-vest. The subsequent Holter-ECG monitoring did not show any ventricular arrhythmia and the 1-month follow-up echocardiographic exam exhibited normal LV function (ejection fraction 61%) without wall motion abnormalities. Thus, the life-vest was removed and the ICD implantation could be deferred. The patient is in stable condition and without cardiac symptoms on three months of follow-up.Since its first description in 1990 in Japan [14], takotsubo cardiomyopathy has become a recognized clinical entity of acute heart failure syndrome. The main characteristic of this condition is the reversible myocardial dysfunction that arises in the presence of permeable coronary arteries. This form of cardiomyopathy is usually seen in elderly women as it was the case in our patient. Although an emotional or physical stress was thought to cause this syndrome, newer data suggest that in almost one-third of patients no trigger can be identified [13]. The clinical presentation can also vary from mild forms to cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest. The latter was noted in our patient as ventricular fibrillation occurred during the transportation to the hospital. Moreover, our patient shares other common features of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. ECG changes, especially T-wave inversions, are a common feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, appearing in almost 40% of patients with this clinical entity [15]. Furthermore, similarly to our patient, the majority of patients diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy present with elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers on admission [16]. Moreover, the localization of the wall motion abnormalities is usually apical, although around 20% of patients can present mid-wall or basal patterns of ventricular dysfunction [2].Interestingly, coronary angiography revealed a spasm of the LAD artery that was reversible immediately after the intracoronary injection of nitroglycerine. The pathophysiology of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is complex and not completely understood. A hyperactivity of the sympathetic system leading to increased catecolamine drive together with altered cellular metabolism and dysfunction of the coronary microcirculation is currently regarded as the main pathomechanisms, which lead to potentially reversible myocardial injury [7]. However, coronary vasospasm is a potential adjacent mechanism that could potentiate the previous described pathogenesis. Moreover, the first cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy suggested coronary vasospasm as the underlying cause of apical myocardial dysfunction [11]. Furthermore, recent reports indicate that coronary vasospasm can act as a trigger for myocardial stunning compatible with the takotsubo syndrome [17, 18]. In our patient, we hypothesize that coronary vasospasm was the major trigger for developing reversible myocardial dysfunction of the LV-apex, compatible with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.Alternatively, the takotsubo-like appearance of the LV could have been the result of the cardiac arrest which was triggered by coronary vasospasm causing subsequent myocardial ischemia. In addition, a prolonged vasospasm may have resulted in similar symptoms. However, some elements may not match with the hypothesis of prolonged coronary vasospasm as substrate for the clinical picture of the patient. Thus, the ECG changes were not typical for isolated vasospasm, which is usually associated with reversible ST-segment elevation [19]. In addition, with coronary vasospasm, myocardial dysfunction is usually reversible within seconds or minutes after the resolution of spasm, which was not the case in our patient [20]. Furthermore, our patient exhibited apical ballooning, which is typical for takotsubo cardiomyopathy and not with hypo- or akinesia of the anterior wall and of the apex, which would rather be typical for spasm of the LAD.Cardiac MRI is a valuable tool in the diagnosis work-up of patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy and can help differentiating between various clinical conditions. Although, at first, it was thought that the absence of late gadolinium enhancement was a condition for diagnosing takotsubo cardiomyopathy, more recent studies have identified patients diagnosed with this form of cardiomyopathy and exhibiting late gadolinium enhancement [21]. In addition, it appears that the late gadolinium enhancement is less likely to be identified in patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy in subsequent cardiac MRI examination performed after several weeks from the first diagnosis [22].The therapeutic approach is not standardized for this pathology and usually supportive therapy is indicated. Beta blockers seem to counterbalance the increased catecolamine drive, although a quarter of patients who develop takotsubo cardiomyopathy are already on beta blocker [23]. In our patient, due to the underlying mechanism identified, we decided for a combination of ß-blockers, ACE inhibitors calcium blockers, and nitrates. The patient showed a good clinical response with gradual improvement and then normalization of her LV function. This is in concordance with previous reports that found a complete recovery at the ventricular function at follow-up [23]. However, care should be taken in such patients, as the prognosis may not be so favourable in some cases [13].The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.The authors thank Mrs. Monika Forschner for the excellent CMR images.

He had constant retrosternal discomfort and appeared malnourished. The chest radiograph revealed a right sided aortic arch with tracheal deviation to the left. A swallow study confirmed a fixed esophageal narrowing at the level of T6. Contrast enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest and neck revealed a mirror image right aortic arch with a left sided cardiac apex and a prominent ductus diverticulum (measuring 1.7 × 1.8 cm). This structure extended posterior to and indented the mid esophagus. A left posterolateral thoracotomy was performed and the ductus diverticulum was resected. A retroesophageal ligamentum arteriosum was found during surgery and divided. This rare combination of congenital anatomical aberrations led to severe dysphagia in our patient. Successful surgical correction in the form of resection of the ductus diverticulum and division of the retroesophageal ligamentum arteriosum led to complete resolution of our patient’s symptoms.We present a patient with dysphagia due to a combination of congenital malformations. These included a right sided aortic arch, a prominent ductus diverticulum, and a retroesophageal ligamentum arteriosum. These malformations put together formed an obstructing vascular ring around the esophagus. We report this unusual combination of malformations with successful surgical correction leading to a favorable clinical outcome.A 49-year-old African American male patient with no past medical history was admitted because of 3 months of difficulty swallowing solid and liquid foods, with retching, regurgitation of mucus, and a sensation of “food getting stuck” in his chest. He had constant retrosternal discomfort, appeared malnourished, and complained of halitosis.A clear liquid diet was provided during the diagnostic evaluation. The chest radiograph revealed a right sided aortic arch with tracheal deviation to the left (Figure 1). A swallow study confirmed a fixed esophageal narrowing at the level of T6 (Figure 2). Contrast enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest and neck revealed a mirror image right aortic arch with a left sided cardiac apex and a prominent ductus diverticulum (measuring 1.7 × 1.8 cm). This structure extended posterior to and indented the mid esophagus (Figure 3). There was no aortic arch dilation with unremarkable pulmonary arteries. High resolution CT angiography with contrast and poststudy 3-dimensional reconstruction is depicted in Figure 4.A left posterolateral thoracotomy was performed and the ductus diverticulum was resected. A retroesophageal ligamentum arteriosum was found during surgery and divided. The postoperative course was uneventful, and complete clinical and radiological resolution of the constriction ensued (Figure 5). The patient tolerated food and drink ad lib. He remains asymptomatic.Right sided aortic arch is a congenital anomaly, which can be a component of a double aortic arch or may be the sole outlet at the level of the aorta. A right sided aortic arch develops from the right 4th branchial instead of the left [1]. This patient’s aortic arch exhibited mirror image branching [2] where the arch passed over the right main stem bronchus and continued on as the descending aorta. The branches arising were (1) the left innominate artery, (2) the right carotid artery, and (3) the right subclavian artery.A ductus diverticulum is a remnant of the infundibular part of the ductus arteriosus. This is a common finding at infancy, present in about 33% of infants, but it involutes over time [3]. A prominent ductus diverticulum is rare and is difficult to visualize on the posteroanterior chest radiograph. On the lateral image it can be seen as a soft tissue mass in the aortopulmonary window. Angiography of the out-pouching is diagnostic, where it is seen as a focal bulge [4]. High resolution CT angiography with contrast and poststudy 3-dimensional reconstruction of the anatomy helped us reach the diagnosis in our case. Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT) has been described to differentiate a ductus diverticulum from aneurysms [5].The simultaneous presence of the aforementioned structures did not explain the extent of esophageal obstruction. The possibility of a vascular ring was thus entertained. A vascular ring refers to a variety of congenital anomalies of the aortic system that can compress the esophagus or trachea causing symptoms [6]. The vascular ring was comprised of the 3 structures externally occluding the esophagus. The first structure was the anteriorly ascending right sided aortic arch; the second structure was the ductus diverticulum laterally. We hypothesized that the third (posterior) component was a retroesophageal ligamentum arteriosum, which had not been identified by preoperative imaging studies. The ligamentum arteriosum can cause significant tracheoesophageal constriction, and its retroesophageal position may cause severe dysphagia [7]. This hypothesis was confirmed during surgical intervention when the retroesophageal ligamentum was visualized and divided.This rare combination of congenital anatomical aberrations led to severe dysphagia in our patient. Successful surgical correction in the form of resection of the ductus diverticulum and division of the retroesophageal ligamentum arteriosum led to complete resolution of our patient’s symptoms. He continues to do well on regular follow-up.All authors have no conflicts of interest.All authors had access to the data and played a vital role in writing the manuscript.
Ventricular Septal Dissection Complicating Inferior Wall Myocardial Infarction

We present a case of acute myocardial infarction from right coronary artery occlusion that developed hypotension and systolic murmur 12 hours after successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Although preoperative imaging suggested a large ventricular septal defect and a pseudoaneurysm, intraoperative findings concluded a serpiginous dissection of the ventricular septum. The imaging technicalities are discussed.Postmyocardial infarction ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a rare complication (1/1000), and ventricular septal dissection is an even less common complication with only four case reports previously described [1–4], the first occurring in 1988. None of these cases appeared on imaging like a cross between a pseudoaneurysm and a VSD, a finding unique to our case.A 60-year-old man presented with chest pain and inferior-lead ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography. He was found to have right coronary artery occlusion and underwent successful percutaneous intervention with a drug-eluting stent. Twelve hours later, he developed mild hypotension (80/60 mmHg) and a II/VI holosystolic murmur. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) in the mid-inferior septal wall (Figure 1(a), Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/9680891) as well as a pseudoaneurysm in the mid-inferior wall, which persisted despite rotating the transducer 90 degrees from the apical four-chamber view (Figure 1(b), Video 2). On repeat imaging, a very narrow apical two-chamber view window in which the inferior wall was intact without the pseudoaneurysm (Figure 1(c), Video 3) was identified with difficulty. Immediate surgery did not reveal a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior wall despite detailed surgical interrogation. The location of the apparent VSD was covered by an aneurysmal structure, with no communication between the right and left ventricles. It was felt that the patient had a serpiginous dissection of the infarcted inferior septum (Figure 1(d), Video 4), which took on the appearance of a pseudoaneurysm on echocardiography. The partial defect in the septum was surgically covered by a Dacron patch (Figures 1(e) and 1(f)) during surgery, which was performed within 24 hours of the diagnostic echocardiogram. The operation resolved the imaging abnormalities seen preoperatively.The prior case reports included use of three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography, which ably depicted the serpiginous tract in our patient. Perhaps the harsh systolic murmur typically seen in postinfarction VSD was only of lower grade here because it was generated from flow across the left ventricle to the intramural interventricular septum cavity/dissection without communication with the right ventricle. We hypothesized that the ventricular septum had septal perforators from both the right coronary artery (infarct-related artery) and left anterior descending artery, with no flow for more than 24 hours in the septal perforators from the right coronary artery and normal blood flow in perforators from the left anterior descending artery. This created shearing forces at the “junction” of the hyperkinetic septum (perfused from the left anterior descending artery) and the akinetic septum (perfused from the right coronary artery). The shearing forces caused dissection of the septum along the junction lines, creating a partial VSD. The right ventricular side of the septum stayed intact and formed an aneurysmal sac. The large pseudoaneurysm-like structure was indeed an intramural hematoma/dissection of the interventricular septum open only on the left ventricular side. Although this mechanism was not described in the prior case reports on ventricular septal dissection [1–4], pseudoaneurysm formation and free-wall rupture in the ventricular free wall are known to occur as a result of this mechanism. In a recent case report, this was noted in a patient who underwent postmyocardial infarction VSD repair and then developed septal dissection as the necrotic tissue in the septum failed to heal [5], necessitating repeat surgical repair. Although echocardiography was useful, MRI provided incremental insights into this case. Rarely, septal dissection can be due to rupture of other surrounding structures, such as ruptured sinus of Valsalva extending into the septum [6].Both postmyocardial infarction entities, pseudoaneurysm and VSD, can be lethal, with mortality rates of approximately 90% unless immediate diagnosis leads to surgical correction. Since most cases of ventricular septum dissection in the literature are with inferior infarction, clinicians need to stay alert for this complication in cases of inferior infarction. Both the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries have septal perforators, anterior septal versus inferior septal, respectively. Therefore occlusion of either can potentially lead to this complication.The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.
Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Patient with Undiscovered Sigmoid Colon Cancer

Here we present a rare case that clinically presented with intermittent abdominal pain, initially impressed as non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure but with a normal coronary angiogram. Her symptoms relieved spontaneously without returning. Sigmoid colon cancer was diagnosed via colonoscopy later due to persistent abdominal discomfort. In the absence of detectable emotional or physical stress factors, the newly diagnosed sigmoid colon cancer was the only possible trigger factor of TTC. We offer this case as a reminder that cancer should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with the etiology of TTC. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is characterized by reversible left systolic dysfunction, which appears to be precipitated by sudden emotional or physical stress in the absence of myocardial infarction. It is also known as “stress-related cardiomyopathy,” “left ventricular apical ballooning,” “ampulla cardiomyopathy,” and “broken heart syndrome.” The most commonly used criteria were proposed by the Mayo Clinic and were revised in 2008 [1]. Patients must satisfy all criteria, including the following: (1) transient hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis in the left ventricular mid-segments with or without apical involvement; regional wall motion abnormalities that extend beyond a single epicardial vascular distribution; and, frequently but not always, a stressful trigger; (2) the absence of obstructive coronary disease or angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture; (3) new electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities or modest elevation in cardiac troponin; and (4) the absence of pheochromocytoma or myocarditis. Although cancer patients have many comorbidities, TTC is rare among cancer patients. On the other hand, cancer may play a role as a trigger of TTC.A 58-year-old Taiwanese woman was brought to the emergency department (ED) due to intermittent epigastric pain that had lasted for weeks but became exacerbated in the previous few hours. Intermittent lower abdominal pain during defecation with tenesmus was also noted for about 1 month. Other relative symptoms included mild dyspnea on exertion, diaphoresis, hiccupping, and vomiting, which became worse in recent days. She had no past medical history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus. She also had neither known family history nor a history of smoking or drug abuse. There was no postural nocturnal dyspnea, palpitation, or radiation pain. She had no body weight changes in the past 6 months.A physical examination at the ED revealed a regular heart rate at 75 beats per min, a blood pressure of 154/101 mmHg, a grade 2 systolic heart murmur at the apex, and clear breathing sounds on auscultation, mild tenderness at the epigastric area, and no edema of the limbs. An initial ECG showed a premature atrial contraction and insignificant ST-T changes (Figure 1(a)). Initial laboratory tests showed mild leukocytosis (WBC: 10000/μL, segment: 84.1%), Hb 14.4 g/dL, platelet count 163000/μL, glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) 22 IU/L, creatinine 1.0 mg/dL, troponin I 0.06 ng/mL, and creatinine kinase MB 0.8/ng/Ml. After fluid hydration, the patient was admitted to the gastrointestinal ward for suspected peptic ulcer disease. At the ward, a pan-endoscopy showed only mild erythematous gastritis, and the procedure went smoothly without obvious discomforts. However, her epigastric pain seemed stronger and she developed palpitation, diaphoresis, and vomiting at the ward on the following day. Due to the exacerbated symptoms at the ward, a second ECG was performed, which showed new diffused T wave inversion over leads II, III, aVF, and V4–6 (Figure 1(b)). A follow-up laboratory test showed elevated cardiac enzymes: troponin I 2.26 ng/mL (normal < 0.05; 0.06 ng/mL at ED) and creatinine kinase MB 10.3 ng/mL (normal < 3.6; 0.8 ng/mL at ED). A cardiovascular section was then assessed. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and anterior-apical wall hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 41% (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit, and cardiac catheterization was arranged for suspected non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. A coronary angiography showed patent coronary arteries (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)) and a left ventriculography showed apical ballooning of the left ventricle, compatible with TTC (Figure 3(c)). The symptoms improved after several days’ treatment with diuretics (furosemide, 20 mg twice per day) and propranolol (10 mg, twice per day).In searching for her triggering factors, there were no detectable emotional or physical factors, including the results of an endocrine survey. The patient was then discharged a few days later with improved symptoms. At OPD, a colonoscopy was further arranged due to intermittent lower abdominal pain during defecation, which accidentally revealed a circumscribed mass with near total obstruction of the sigmoid colon about 20 cm from the anal verge (Figure 4). Her tumor markers were within the normal range. The patient was then referred to a surgeon for laparoscopic radical sigmoidectomy, and the biopsy showed adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon (cT3N0M0). A follow-up ECG 3 months later revealed an improved ejection fraction of 70% without regional wall motion abnormalities or significant mitral regurgitation. No recurrent angina or dyspnea was present, and the patient is currently being followed up at the oncology OPD.It is hard to distinguish TTC from acute coronary syndrome in the early clinical stages. Nearly 90% of reported cases of stress-induced cardiomyopathy occurred in postmenopausal women [2]. TTC may account for up to 2% of overall acute coronary syndrome cases and has a low mortality rate of less than 2% and a recovery rate greater than 95% [3, 4]. The etiology of TTC is thought to be related to stress and catecholamine-induced myocardial injury with elevated norepinephrine levels noted in many patients [5]. About 44% of the stressful events that initiate TTC are emotional in nature, and 36% are physical [6].In the case described here, the persistent epigastric and lower abdominal symptoms lasted for weeks and eventually developed into dyspnea after left ventricular dysfunction proceeded. It is possible that the TTC was induced by pan-endoscopy [7], but the procedure went smoothly and did not induce any intensive pain or vomiting. Atypical angina and dyspnea already occurred before the invasive examination. Procedure-related stress cardiomyopathy cannot be excluded but the probability is low. The patient presented with LV apical hypokinesis both on ECG and ventriculography with transient mitral regurgitation, which has been reported before [8–10].Among TTC cases overall, cancer has been rarely reported. Among the cancer-related TTC cases, lymphoproliferative disorder (30%), gastrointestinal cancer (15%), and lung cancer (12.5%) were among the most common types observed [11]. Among these patients, perisurgical procedures (such as abdominal surgery or stem cell transplant) were the most common trigger factors (37.5%), followed by chemotherapeutic agents use (13.16%). Emotional stress related to both cancer diagnosis and treatment was also likely a contributor, as patients diagnosed with cancer have been shown to have significantly higher rates of anxiety and depression [12]. Other stressors include changes in their home and family life and fear of disease or death, and those with chronic psychological stress are at risk of developing TTC, which is then triggered by an acute stressor [13]. There have been rare case reports of TTC noted before a diagnosed cancer history. Burgdorf and colleagues have reported a 23.6% incidence of cancer in a cohort of 191 patients with TTC [14], and about 14% new diagnosed malignancy rate in TTC group after a 3-year follow-up (the rate in the control group was zero). This suggests that malignancy may contribute to the pathophysiology of TTC. In some hypotheses, the effects of catecholamines on myocardial function may be induced by a switch in the β2-adrenergic receptor (2-AR) intracellular signalling from a Gs to Gi protein [15], which further increases the level of inflammatory mediators. Inflammation may lead to activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, a downstream effector of the 2-AR signalling pathway that has a negative inotropic effect [16–18]. The relationship between malignancy, inflammation, and myocardial damage still requires further investigation. In conclusion, malignancy screening should be considered if available in patients with unknown cause of TTC.Written informed consent was not available because of change of residence but oral agreement from the patient was obtained.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interests.
Premature Ventricular Complex Causing Ice-Pick Headache
1Ankara Education and Research Hospital, Department of Cardiology, Ankara,  Turkey2Private Yenisehir Hospital, Department of Cardiology, Mersin,  TurkeyCorrespondence should be addressed to Ertan Yetkin; moc.liamtoh@nikteynatreReceived 8 October 2016; Revised 2 February 2017; Accepted 5 February 2017; Published 7 March 2017Academic Editor: Konstantinos P. LetsasCopyright © 2017 Selcuk Ozturk  and Ertan Yetkin. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Ice pick headache is a momentary, transient, repetitive headache disorder and manifests with the stabbing pains and jolts. The exact mechanism causing this disease is unknown. Premature ventricular contractions are early depolarization of the ventricular myocardium and in the absence of a structural heart disease, it is considered to be a benign disease. In this report, we describe a male patient presenting with the symptom of momentary headache attacks accompanied with instant chest pain which is associated with premature ventricular contraction.Ice-pick headache (IPH), which is also named as “primary stabbing headache” was first defined by Lansche as “ophthalmodynia periodica.” The exact prevalence is unknown but %2–30 of the adult population is thought to be affected in their lifetime [1]. It is characterized with stabbing, momentary headache attacks lasting seconds, being repetitive and transient, and manifestation of multiple jolts. It has a female dominance. The main pathophysiological mechanism underlying this type of headache is unknown [1, 2].Premature ventricular contraction (PVC), which is also named ventricular extrasystole, premature ventricular beat, or ventricular ectopia, is early depolarization of the ventricular myocardium [3, 4]. Its prevalence varies from %1 to %4 in the general population and increases with aging. Occasionally, it is associated with structural heart disease and increases risk of sudden death. In the absence of a heart disease, it has an excellent outcome [4].Symptoms in PVCs patients range from palpitation, dyspnea, chest discomfort, lightheadedness, dizziness, exercise limitation, presyncope, syncope, heart failure, and sudden death [4, 5]. Here we describe a case of a PVC patient presenting with the complaint of simultaneous instant chest pain and momentary headache.A 78-year-old man presented to cardiology clinic with complaints of instant chest pain accompanied with instantaneous headache at the left temporal region of the head with a strike of lightning. He had been suffering from this complaint for one week. He denied palpitation, dyspnea, syncope, or presyncope. In his detailed history, he had no hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. He underwent coronary angiography one year ago because of an anginal chest pain and there was no significant stenosis in the coronary arteries. He had been prescribed acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, and metoprolol 50 mg at that time and the patient was compatible with his treatment. Cardiac examination revealed normal blood pressure, normal heart sounds with a regular rhythm, and no murmurs, S3 or S4. The electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with a single PVC on the ECG record and during the electrocardiographic examination he experienced the same instant chest pain and headache attack again. During the attack, he had no neurological or gastrointestinal signs. Neurological examination and radiological evaluation including cranial tomography and MR were found to be normal, previously. Echocardiographic examination was within the normal limits and there were no abnormal findings in the blood tests. Then, twenty-four-hour rhythm Holter monitoring was planned and he was told to record chest pain and headache attacks time during the day. Holter monitoring revealed normal sinus rhythm with 80 PVCs most frequently occurring during the night time, synchronous to the patient’s chest pain and headache attacks. The patient’s average heart rate was 63 beats per minute. Metoprolol therapy was reduced to 25 mg per day and amiodarone therapy has been added to the medical treatment of the patient which were thought to reduce the frequency of the attacks or terminate it. As thought, his complaints significantly improved at the end of the one month and there were no findings of PVC on the ECG recording and rhythm Holter monitoring. He has been followed up and was symptom-free for 6 months. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a PVC presenting with headache attacks described in literature. IPH is the shortest lasting headache known and it usually occurs without other symptoms. There is not a linkage between IPH and other neurological disorders [1, 2]. Among the various types of headache, migraine is known to be associated with cardiac diseases and cardiac anomalies [6]. In terms of arrhythmia, migraine headache has been reported to be associated with atrial fibrillation in the literature [7, 8]. Recurrent atrial fibrillation attacks have been shown to coincide with migraine headaches [8]. However, there is not any report in the literature about the association between PVC and headache.Stabbing pains are more dominant in the branches of trigeminal nerve such as orbital, temporal, and parietal regions. Although there is not an exact mechanism in the pathophysiology of IPH, irritation of the trigeminal or other nerves has been suggested as a possible mechanism [1]. This situation can explain the stabbing headache in the temporal region of the head and accompanying strike of lighting in our patient.Extraordinary symptoms such as burping, tinnitus, and absence of seizure-like attacks have been documented during supraventricular tachycardia [9–11]. The possible underlying mechanism of extraordinary symptoms during supraventricular tachycardia has been supposed to be cross-talk between the cardiac afferent fibers and cranial nerves or ganglia through the impulse propagation [12].Turhan et al. have described a case of a patient presenting with migrainous headaches and atrial fibrillation attacks. In their patient, they have proposed the possible mechanism causing atrial fibrillation to be the activation of the autonomic nervous system and vagal nerve stimulation during vomiting triggered by migraine attacks [8]. Although this is one of the acceptable explanations, this suggestion cannot be adapted to our patient directly. Cross-talk between the cardiac afferent nerves and cranial nerves through cervical ganglia and spinal cord might have resulted in sensation of instantaneous headache during the PVCs. Several examples of cross-talk as a possible cause of neurological symptoms have been reported and discussed in literature [10–13]. All the fibers forming the different cardiac plexus present shunts with cranial nerves via cervical plexus and brachial plexus [14]. The stimuli originated from the ventricular wall due to PVC and its cross-talk during the impulse propagation might have resulted in a short, momentary headache.In conclusion, we have described the first case of PVC presenting with momentary headache accompanying instant chest pain which has not been reported in literature, previously. Cardiac arrhythmias should be kept in mind in differential diagnosis of atypical neurological symptoms unless otherwise diagnosed by neurologists.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
FOLFOX Induced Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Treated with Impella Assist Device
1Internal Medicine, University of Miami, Palm Beach Regional Consortium, Atlantis, FL,  USA2Cardiology, University of Miami, Palm Beach Regional Consortium, Atlantis, FL,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Swethika Sundaravel; moc.liamg@inirahakihtewsReceived 16 January 2017; Accepted 26 February 2017; Published 7 March 2017Academic Editor: Markus FerrariCopyright © 2017 Swethika Sundaravel et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Chemotherapy induced cardiotoxicity is becoming increasingly prevalent with several new agents being used recently. The incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to 5-fluorouracil based chemotherapeutic regimens like FOLFOX is not uncommon. It is also seen with platinum based chemotherapy. Most of these patients have reversible cardiotoxicity and the cardiac function recovers within a short period with supportive treatment. Here we have a patient who presented with cardiogenic shock after 5 days of receiving FOLFOX regimen for colorectal adenocarcinoma. She was treated with a percutaneous left ventricular assist device, Impella CP, for hemodynamic support with excellent outcome.This is a 61-year-old woman with history of paroxysmal atrial flutter status afrer ablation who was recently diagnosed with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of colon status after hemicolectomy. She had no other past medical history and was not taking any medications. She was a nonsmoker and nonalcoholic and denied use of illicit drugs. She was started on adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX (5FU + folinic acid + oxaliplatin). Patient was tolerating the regimen without any complications until day 5 when she started experiencing acute dyspnea and diaphoresis. She was rushed to the emergency department. She was found to be hypotensive and in profound respiratory distress from pulmonary edema with extensive crackles bilaterally on chest auscultation. She was tachypneic and her oxygen saturation was 72% with 5 liters of nasal oxygen. She had to intubated immediately.Her ECG showed T inversions in the precordial leads and ST flattening in the inferolateral leads. Troponin was 0.41 ng/mL and trended up to 1.7 ng/mL in 12 hrs. NT-pro-BNP was 7392 pg/mL. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary edema. Bedside 2D transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 1) was done which showed hyperdynamic contraction of the basal region and stunning of the apex with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25–30% (echo 1 month ago, before starting chemotherapy had normal ejection fraction).She underwent cardiac catheterization (Figures 2 and 3) which revealed normal flow in all the coronary arteries and left ventriculogram ejection fraction of 20% (Figure 4). Left Ventricular End Diastolic Pressure (LVEDP) was 25 mmHg and mean arterial pressure was less than 50 mmHg. Right heart catheterization demonstrated Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP) of 22 mmHg with mean pulmonary artery pressure of 29 mmHg. Her initial cardiac index was 1.5–2.1 liters/min/m2 and the cardiac output was 2.5–3 liters/min. Lactic acid level in the blood was 6 mmol/liter. An Impella CP assist device was placed for cardiac support. She also had a Swan-Ganz catheter in place for close hemodynamic monitoring. She also received diuresis and respiratory support. Over the next 3 days, she recovered remarkably. Her cardiac index improved to 2.5–3 liters/min/m2 and the mean pulmonary artery pressure improved to 19 mmHg. The lactic acid in the blood also came down to 1.5 mmol/liter. Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 35–40% with some contractile activity of the apical segments as well. The device was removed on day 3. She was also slowly weaned off pressor support and extubated in the subsequent days. She was discharged on day 7 with beta-blockers, expected to follow up with oncology for a different regimen.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is defined as nonischemic cardiomyopathy which occurs usually due to stress and increased catecholamine levels in the blood. Also known as apical ballooning syndrome, it is associated with a transient left ventricular hypokinesis with ECG changes and troponin elevation in the setting of nonobstructive coronary arteries and absence of pheochromocytoma or other usual causes of myocarditis [1]. It was first reported in Japan, in 1990 [2]. It is most prevalent in women over the age of 50 years, although it is not uncommon in men. 4 types of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy have been described so far: apical, mid-ventricular, basal, and focal hypokinesis [3]. The incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy after 5FU based chemotherapy is becoming increasingly prevalent [4]. Several cases have been reported in the literature [5, 6].The pathogenesis of this condition is believed to be due to coronary vasospasm mediated 5FU and its metabolites [7]. Other possible mechanisms are direct cardiotoxicity of 5FU on the myocytes and endothelial damage. The incidence of cardiotoxicity is less with bolus regimens [8] than with continuous infusions or with coadministration of leucovorin [9] or cisplatin [10]. The usual clinical presentation is angina-like chest pain during the infusion of the drug with concomitant ECG changes [11]. It can also present with arrhythmias and cardiac arrest in rare instances [12]. About 2% of cases present in cardiogenic shock, like our patient [13]. Almost 95% of patients recover to normal cardiac function, but sometimes mortality rates can be as high as 8% [14]. Our patient was quite different in presentation from the rest. She presented on day 5 after the chemotherapy with cardiogenic shock.The treatment is usually supportive with nitrates and calcium channel blockers in the acute phase along with hemodynamic support in the form of ventricular assist devices or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) if needed. These patients must be started on beta-blockers for long-term treatment. In chemotherapy induced cases, discontinuing the offending agent is almost always inevitable. Following resolution of the acute cardiotoxic phase, reinstitution of the same agent has proven to be fatal in some cases [15] and recurrence of Takotsubo has also been reported [16]. Considering these life-threatening complications, it is not advisable to rechallenge the patient with the same chemotherapeutic agent [17].The use of cardiac assist devices for acute cardiogenic shock is well known. There are several types of devices including Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps (IABP), Impella devices, tandem heart, and Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD). The use of Impella device for acute cardiogenic shock is becoming more popular because of its immediate augmentation of the left ventricular function and its ability to supplement the cardiac output to about 2.5–5 liters/min. It is used regularly for acute coronary syndromes and nonischemic cardiomyopathies including Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [18, 19]. It is proven to be more effective, feasible, and safe compared to Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps by providing superior hemodynamic support [20]. To our knowledge and on review of literature, there is no reported case of FOLFOX or chemotherapy induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy that has been treated with Impella device. Our patient had severe cardiogenic shock with an EF of 20% which necessitated the Impella assist device. We used Impella CP which provided an additional cardiac output of about 2.5–3 liters/min. The patient’s cardiac function improved remarkably in 3 days and the device was removed. There were no complications encountered.5-Fluorouracil based chemotherapeutic regimens are extremely potent in treating several cancers including high grade colorectal malignancies. The most important and most dangerous side-effect of this drug is the cardiotoxicity which can manifest in many ways ranging from subtle angina to florid cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation. Several other chemotherapeutic agents like platinum based therapies are also associated with cardiotoxicity. Cardiac oncology is a relatively new field of cardiology dealing with cancer patients who have suffered cardiotoxicity from chemotherapy. Several novel strategies have been tested to minimize the side-effects of these drugs including prophylactic nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors/ARBs to these patients, but, so far, none of them have been proven effective except dose reduction of the chemotherapeutic agent and bolus regimens.The treatment of acute cardiogenic shock has also come a long way with the discovery of new percutaneous ventricular assist devices which have proven to be very effective in the decompensated setting. The use of these devices in chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy has shown to decrease the number of hospital/ICU days and result in speedy recovery. More randomized trials and systematic reviews are required to analyze the overall use of such devices.The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in an Extremely Tortuous S-Shaped Aorta

We present a case of a successful transfemoral TAVI in a high-risk patient with an extremely tortuous iliofemoral system and a significant S-type bend in the descending aorta. With careful preprocedure planning and using all the techniques available, TAVI can be performed in the most challenging patients.Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative technique to treating aortic stenosis in patients with high surgical risk [1]. With increased utilization of TAVI, specific cases may pose unique challenges, including complex anatomy. We present a case of a successful transfemoral TAVI in a high-risk patient with an extremely tortuous iliofemoral system and a significant S-type bend in the descending aorta.An 85-year-old male with atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, previous transient ischemic attack, permanent pacemaker, and symptomatic severe aortic stenosis was deemed very high risk for surgical valve replacement. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area 0.9 cm2, mean aortic valve gradient 42 mmHg) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and mild pulmonary hypertension. He was referred to, and accepted by the TAVI Heart Team. During the preprocedure workup, he was found to have a very tortuous iliofemoral system, as well as a significant S-type bend in the descending aorta (Figures 1(a)–1(c), Video  (see supplementary Video 1 in the Supplementary Materials available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/2936513)). Because of the less robust data with transapical approach [2] and our center’s limited expertise with other access methods, we chose to pursue transfemoral TAVI.On the day of TAVI, bilateral femoral arterial access (8 Fr) was obtained, along with left femoral venous access for transvenous pacing. Via the left femoral arterial sheath, an 8 Fr Amplatz guide catheter was placed into the proximal descending aorta and two Lunderquist (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana) wires were sequentially placed into the aortic arch through this catheter. A pull on the catheter was required to straighten the descending aorta (Figure 1(d), Video ).A 20 Fr Sapien e-sheath via the right side was placed in the descending aorta. Valvuloplasty with a 25 mm balloon was performed over an Amplatz wire. A 29 mm Sapien XT valve (Edwards Lifescience, Irvine, California) was advanced into the aorta, which was very technically challenging (Video ). While trying to manipulate the valve beyond the acute angulation in the aortic root, the ventricular wire was inadvertently pulled. With catheter torquing, a straight glide wire was used to recross and allow the nose cone to cross the native aortic valve. After switching over to a third Lunderquist wire, the valve was correctly aligned (Figure 1(e)) and deployed under burst pacing (Figure 1(f), Video ). A transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated good valve position and trace aortic insufficiency. At the end of the procedure, an aortogram was performed which did not show any evidence of aortic injury.TAVI has emerged as an alternative technique to treating aortic stenosis in patients with high surgical risk. Careful preprocedural planning is required for a successful TAVI procedure. The goals of preprocedural planning are to assess the optimal method of access; define anatomic relationships between the aortic valve, root, left ventricle, and coronary ostia; choose the optimal device size; and, lastly, contribute to the procedural plan [3]. Multimodality imaging is required to address these issues, including the use of angiography, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), echocardiography, and occasionally ultrasound and cardiac magnetic resonance. While echocardiography and angiography are often completed prior to referral to the Heart Team, MDCT also plays a pivotal role in preprocedural planning. MDCT allows assessment of the access site, particularly for transfemoral approach. In our patient, a pre-TAVI workup revealed an extremely tortuous S-shaped aorta and allowed for further planning prior to the procedure.Tortuous aortas have rarely been described in the literature [4, 5], and we describe a case of a successful transfemoral TAVI being performed through an extremely sigmoid descending aorta using techniques to straighten the vessel. Using all the techniques available, transfemoral TAVI can be performed in the most challenging patients.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Conventional Coronary Angiography Induced Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Complicated with Cardiac Tamponade

TCM has a benign prognosis and serious complications are uncommon. However, though very rarely reported, cardiac tamponade has occurred on some occasions. We hereby report the case of a 70-year-old woman who underwent coronary angiography with an ergonovine provocation test to evaluate recurrent chest pain and was readmitted 7 days later presenting with TCM, followed by left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and cardiac tamponade.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is an acute cardiac syndrome characterized by transient and reversible systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV) [1]. TCM is often misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [2]. TCM predominantly affects elderly women and is uniquely preceded by emotional or physical stress [3, 4]. Various stressors have been reported to induce TCM, including minimally invasive procedures such as pacemaker placement [5]. The prognosis is benign; however, there are serious complications such as life-threatening arrhythmia, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, acute heart failure, and cardiac death can follow [1]. Cardiac tamponade has also been reported on very rare occasions [6]. In this report, we present an unusual case of TCM induced by coronary angiography (CAG) with an ergonovine provocation test that was complicated with cardiac tamponade.A 70-year-old woman, presenting with vague chest pain that she had been experiencing for the past year, was admitted for coronary angiography. She did not have any cardiovascular risk factors. There were no abnormal findings during a physical examination or during any routine tests, which included electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, blood tests, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). CAG showed atherosclerotic change with mild stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) (Figure 1(a)). Provocation test (60 μg of ergonovine in physiological saline into the left coronary artery over a period of 3 minutes) showed coronary spasm in the mid-LAD causing up to 70% stenosis by quantitative coronary analysis (Figure 1(b)). Typical chest pain and T wave inversion were recognized simultaneously. She was diagnosed with vasospastic angina and discharged with vasodilators (a calcium channel blocker and nitrate).One week after her discharge, she was readmitted to the emergency department presenting with continuous substernal chest pain unfavorable response to the vasodilators. Initial ECG showed ST segment elevation in the precordial leads (V2~V6), and ST segment elevation persisted after intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin (Figure 2). The patient was transferred to a cardiac catheter laboratory, but there was neither occlusion nor significant narrowing on coronary arteries (Figure 2). Intravascular ultrasound confirmed an eccentric soft plaque without plaque rupture or thrombus formation. TTE showed an apical hypokinesia with normal range of LV ejection fraction and LVOT obstruction (Figure 3). Blood tests revealed elevated levels of the serum cardiac enzymes creatine kinase-MB (31.5 ng/mL; normal range < 3.6 ng/mL) and troponin I (9.83 ng/mL; normal range < 0.16 ng/mL). The patient was diagnosed with TCM caused by previous CAG with ergonovine provocation test and was admitted for close observation.Three days after her readmission, the patient’s condition had abruptly deteriorated involving a shock state and respiratory failure. Her vital signs were as follows: a blood pressure of 84/69 mm Hg, a heart rate of 142 bpm, and a respiration rate of 37 bpm. There was no symptom or sign indicating dehydration. Inotropic infusion and mechanical ventilation were applied. TTE revealed a small amount of pericardial effusion with right ventricular collapse during late-diastole and dilated inferior vena cava without respiratory variation (Figure 4). LVOT obstruction was aggravated to a peak velocity over 5 m/s. Immediate therapeutic pericardiocentesis and fluid infusion were performed to treat for cardiac tamponade, after which the patient’s blood pressure promptly recovered up to 120/60 mm Hg. She achieved hemodynamic stability without inotropic support by the next day. Pericardial effusion was exudate (protein 5.7 g/dl, LDH 2587 U/L, neutrophil 52%, and lymphocyte 31%), but there was no evidence of malignancy or infection. Her condition gradually improved and follow-up TTE after 2 weeks revealed spontaneously recovered LV systolic function without wall motion abnormality.TCM is characterized by transient LV dysfunction, ECG changes, and elevation of cardiac markers, similar to presentation of ACS, and it occurs following emotional or physical stress. In addition to physical stress from surgery or anesthesia, physical stress from cardiology procedures may trigger TCM [5, 7]. In the present case, TCM was triggered by physical stress induced by CAG and ergonovine provocation test. The main pathophysiology of TCM is catecholamine-induced microvascular vasoconstriction and direct myocardial toxicity [8, 9]. The epicardial vasospasm was proposed as one of the mechanisms of TCM. However, this hypothesis has not been confirmed. In the present case, vasospasm by ergonovine provocation test was confirmed. However, there were no vasospasm on the second CAG and no response to nitroglycerine. Therefore, we believe that TCM, not myocardial infarction, was the cause of readmission.The clinical course and prognosis of TCM are generally favorable, but several complications can occur including heart failure, arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, LVOT obstruction, mitral regurgitation, ventricular thrombus, cardiac rupture, and death [10]. While many studies report good long-term prognosis, the acute phase of TCM can be life-threatening [1]. In the present case, the patient experienced a fatal complication, cardiac tamponade with LVOT obstruction. Cardiac tamponade and LVOT obstruction were interrelated in this case. A disproportionate increase in the pericardial pressure even smaller increments in pericardial fluid can cause a cardiac tamponade. Moreover, depending on anatomical variations and the susceptibility of the patient, acute LVOT obstruction can occur, which can further exacerbate the development of acute failure syndrome [11]. In the present case, extensive apical ballooning and a hyperkinetic basal wall may have contributed to aggravation of LVOT obstruction although she was of euvolemic status. And low cardiac output caused by LVOT obstruction can then further exacerbate cardiac tamponade.In conclusion, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of TCM induced by CAG with ergonovine test and complicated with cardiac tamponade. It is important, therefore, to note that CAG with provocation test can trigger TCM and that fatal complications can result. Furthermore, in conditions of low cardiac output, small amount of pericardial effusion can be presented as cardiac tamponade. These factors should be considered during acute phase management of TCM.Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
ACE Inhibitor-Induced Angioedema following Cervical Spine Surgery

However, ACE inhibitors induced angioedema after cervical surgery is a rare condition. They result in increased levels of circulating bradykinins. Rare cases of angioedema following local trauma in patients using ACE inhibitors have been published. We present such a case. A 54-year-old Caucasian female with a history significant for hypertension, controlled with lisinopril, was admitted for routine cervical spine surgery. She has severe degenerative cervical disc disease and was admitted to the hospital for an elective cervical diskectomy. The patient failed weaning off the ventilator on multiple attempts postoperatively. There were no observed symptoms of an allergic reaction. A CT scan of the neck showed extensive soft tissue edema at the level of the arytenoids. Dexamethasone was given to reduce the edema without successful resolution. On review of her medications, it was found that the patient was resumed on lisinopril following the procedure. It was subsequently discontinued. By the following day the patient had a positive leak around the ET tube cuff and patient was successfully extubated. Angioedema is a well-known side effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). Angioedema occurs because ACE inhibitors impair bradykinin degradation, leading to increase in bradykinin levels. Bradykinin in turn leads to increased vasodilation and vascular permeability, resulting in angioedema. Mast cells are not involved in this pathway. As a result, histamine is not produced, therefore symptoms of pruritus and urticaria do not present.ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema tends to involve the periorbital region and structures within the oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx [1, 2]. ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema after cervical surgery is a rare condition. A few cases of angioedema following local trauma in patients using ACE inhibitors have been published [3–7]. We present an interesting case of severe angioedema causing airway obstruction after anterior cervical surgery in a patient using ACE inhibitors.A 54-year-old Caucasian female with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cervical disc disease, and depression was admitted for routine cervical spine surgery. She has never smoked and does not drink alcohol. Her medications included lisinopril 10 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg, citalopram 20 mg, and furosemide 20 mg. She has severe degenerative disk disease at C4–C7, with herniated nucleus pulposus. The patient was admitted to hospital for an elective cervical disk arthroplasty with diskectomy at C4 to C7 and fusion at C5–C7.The patient failed weaning off the ventilator on multiple attempts postoperatively. There were no observed symptoms of an allergic reaction. Her vital signs and laboratory tests were unremarkable. CT scan of the neck showed extensive edema at the level of the arytenoids, but no retropharyngeal hematoma or abscess were noted (Figure 1). A bronchoscopy confirmed arytenoid edema.Dexamethasone 8 mg was given every 6 hours for 4 days to reduce the edema without successful resolution. On review of her medications, it was found that the patient was on lisinopril following the procedure for the treatment of hypertension. It was subsequently discontinued. The following day, the patient was weaned and successfully extubated.In our case the surgery most likely resulted in marked bradykinin release in a patient who was already on an ACE inhibitor. The release of bradykinin, in addition to decreased bradykinin catabolism as a result of ACE inhibitor therapy, has precipitated angioedema. The definitive treatment of angioedema is to completely stop the offending medication, in this case lisinopril.There are several risk factors that can contribute to ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, including previous angioedema, age above 65, NSAID use, female sex, smoking, seasonal allergies, certain immunosuppressants (sirolimus and everolimus), underlying C1 inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction, history of ACE inhibitor-induced cough, and surgery [8–10]. The relevant risk factors to our case are female sex and surgery, though no further testing was carried out to look for C1 inhibitor deficiency.The areas affected by ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema are the face, mouth, upper airway, and intestine. In the reported cases where angioedema occurred following surgical procedures, the affected areas involved the oral cavity and upper airway [5–7]. This is likely due to local trauma as a result of the cervical spinal surgery. This is consistent with reviewed literature since head and neck surgery appear to increase the incidence of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema to the oropharynx and upper airway. Of the three surgical cases reported, two required definitive airways to be present to prevent airway compromise, one of which failed intubation and required a tracheotomy [5, 7]. Only one reported case did not require intubation to secure the airway [6].The mainstay of management is to secure the airway, discontinue the ACE inhibitor, and give systemic steroids. Other additions can include giving epinephrine and antihistaminics [5]. Persistent symptoms may require synthetic bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist. In the reviewed cases, however, the management was similar to that of our case. The airway was secured and systemic steroids were given. In one case, Benadryl and epinephrine were administered as angioedema was treated as an allergic reaction. In another case systemic steroids were given for a period of 7 days for complete resolution [5–7].To sum up, although ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is rare in the surgical setting, the complications can be life-threatening. ACE inhibitors should be discontinued in ALL patients undergoing neck surgery, regardless of the presence of specific risk factors. There is no sense in taking any risks.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Myocardial Infarction after Endoscopic Removal of Foreign Body
1Department of Internal Medicine, Jacobi Medical Center/Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center, Bronx, NY,  USA2Department of Cardiology, Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center, Bronx, NY,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Carola Maraboto; gro.eroifetnom@tobaramcReceived 12 November 2016; Revised 18 January 2017; Accepted 29 January 2017; Published 26 February 2017Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2017 Carola Maraboto et al.

However, mortality from myocardial ischemia, particularly in the elderly population, is elevated. We illustrate the rare case of a 79-year-old man with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who developed a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) after endoscopic removal of a foreign body. This case report summarizes a rare complication of a low-risk procedure and highlights the importance of considering this potential adverse event, particularly in patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors, to promote early diagnosis and proper treatment.Incidence of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) following endoscopic procedures is low (<1%), and usually these interventions do not require further preoperative testing [1].Cardiac complications are 2–5 times more likely to occur during emergency procedures than with elective interventions [2]. There are different tools to estimate risk of complications before an invasive procedure; one of the most widely used is the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, by Lee et al. [3], which can reliably predict postoperative cardiac outcomes and lead to interventions to lower preoperative risk; however this is usually not feasible in emergency situations.A 79-year-old man, former smoker and with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, presented to the hospital after swallowing a piece of denture while eating carrots. On arrival physical exam and laboratory tests were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed esophageal distention compatible with ingested foreign body, as well as aortic and coronary atherosclerosis. A flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done attempting foreign body removal; however it was unsuccessful and during the procedure ST-segment elevation was noted on the cardiac monitor. An emergent rigid esophagoscopy was performed and the foreign object was removed. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a left bundle branch block (LBBB) that did not meet Sgarbossa criteria; however there was no prior ECG to compare with (Figure 1(a)); vital signs were normal and initial troponin T was undetectable. Physical exam revealed chest crepitus and X-ray showed subcutaneous emphysema with pneumomediastinum, which was thought to be secondary to esophageal microperforations.Repeat ECG (Figure 1(b)) showed sinus tachycardia, LBBB, and more prominent ST depressions in inferior and lateral leads; patient denied chest pain or dyspnea but reported mild abdominal pain. Troponin T rose to 4.72 ng/mL (reference range 0.00–0.10 ng/mL) and diagnosis of NSTEMI was made; management for ACS was started.Coronary angiography was attempted once but patient became very agitated during the procedure; the Interventional Cardiology team increased the sedation to try to finish the study but patient remained restless and kept moving all his extremities, so continuing the procedure under these circumstances would have been extremely dangerous.Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed anteroseptum, apex, and distal-anterior wall akinesis; left ventricular ejection fraction was 30% (normal 5 years back). Troponin T peaked at 9.37 ng/mL and then trended down. Before being discharged, the medical team discussed extensively the importance of having a coronary arteriogram done to evaluate the presence of obstructive lesions in the coronary vasculature. Despite the insistence of the team and the broad discussion with the patient regarding different methods of anesthesia, patient refused to undergo this procedure given his prior experience. He remained hemodynamically stable and was discharged in stable condition.This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first case report of NSTEMI associated with esophageal microperforation after endoscopy in the setting of foreign body ingestion. A few reports do exist; however, of myocardial ischemia following gastroscopy [4], suggesting this procedure conveys an elevated risk in patients with underlying coronary artery disease.Myocardial ischemia results from imbalance between oxygen demand and supply. During endoscopy, catecholamine-induced tachycardia can trigger it in patients with high atheromatous burden and fixed coronary stenosis or with development of hypoxia during a difficult procedure. In our patient, the ACS could have been induced by stress of aspirated dentures and the intervention triggering any of these mechanisms; however we were unable to exclude other etiologies such as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.Adverse cardiopulmonary events attributable to endoscopic procedures are rare [5–9] and range from hypoxia to pneumonia, respiratory arrest, ACS, stroke, and shock [10]. Nevertheless, mortality after acute myocardial infarction increases dramatically in the elderly population [11–14]. Cardiac complications result from a combination of factors specific to the patient, the procedure, and the surrounding circumstances. Patient-related factors include male gender, advanced age, cardiopulmonary disease, and increased Revised Cardiac Risk Index [15, 16]; procedure-related factors include technical difficulty causing hypoxemia [9, 17–19]. Our patient had significant cardiovascular risk factors, but no evidence of documented coronary artery disease prior to presentation nor an active cardiac condition, and given the emergent need for intervention further testing prior to this was not indicated; however we should keep in mind that the risk of serious cardiac complications increases significantly in these patients with multiple risk factors and advanced age, who are additionally undergoing an emergency procedure.Current guidelines for preoperative cardiovascular evaluation do not recommend a preoperative 12-lead ECG or any other form of preprocedural cardiac assessment in asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk interventions [1, 20], and endoscopy falls into a low-risk category according to the current classification. In this particular case, when patient presented to the Emergency Room he was completely asymptomatic and about to undergo an urgent low-risk intervention to remove the ingested foreign body, and the decision was to proceed with the endoscopic procedure given the urgency of his situation; however, we have to keep in mind that guidelines are exactly that, a guide, and not rigid rules. As in every decision in medicine, considerations regarding further preoperative evaluation have to be made according to the risk/benefit ratio of every individual patient, using available resources to estimate probabilities of effectiveness and adverse effects.ECG is an inexpensive and very useful tool that could benefit some asymptomatic patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors undergoing low-risk procedures and could be a cost-effective test to promote early diagnosis and treatment of cardiac complications. This case report summarizes an example of these adverse events aiming to increase awareness of this potentially fatal complication and highlight the relevance of prompt intervention and judicious use of preprocedural testing (e.g., ECG) despite guideline statements to the contrary. This underscores that guidelines are just that and are not rigid, unbreakable rules with proper documented justification.Informed consent was obtained.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Hyperkalemia Induced Brugada Phenocopy: A Rare ECG Manifestation
1Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, Department of Medicine, 1650 Selwyn Avenue, No. 10C, Bronx, NY 10457,  USA2Lehigh Valley Hospital, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, 1627 W. Chew St., Allentown, PA 18104,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Muhammad Ameen; moc.liamg@151neemamrdReceived 18 December 2016; Accepted 8 February 2017; Published 23 February 2017Academic Editor: Konstantinos P. LetsasCopyright © 2017 Muhammad Ameen et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited disorder of cardiac ion channels characterized by peculiar ECG findings predisposing individuals to ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Various electrolyte disturbances and ion channels blocking drugs could also provoke BrS ECG findings without genetic BrS. Clinical differentiation and recognition are essential for guiding the legitimate action. Hyperkalemia is well known to cause a wide variety of ECG manifestations. Severe hyperkalemia can even cause life threatening ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Most common ECG findings include peaked tall T waves with short PR interval and wide QRS complex. Since it is very commonly encountered disorder, physicians need to be aware of even its rare ECG manifestations, which include ST segment elevation and Brugada pattern ECG (BrP). We are adding a case to the limited literature about hyperkalemia induced reversible Brugada pattern ECG changes.Hyperkalemia is one of the most common electrolyte abnormalities that caused vast majority of ECG manifestation ranging from ST elevation to sine waves. It can also rarely cause Brugada pattern on ECG and it is very important for the clinicians to be aware of this presentation as treatment for both modalities is totally different, needing correction of potassium balance in hyperkalemia induced Brugada pattern and lot of investigations and ICD consideration in Brugada syndrome. Here we are presenting a case report of Brugada pattern on ECG caused by hyperkalemia that was reversed with the reversal of electrolyte imbalance.A 43-year-old white male presented to ER with profound lower extremities weakness and severe muscle aches. Review of system was positive for decreased sensation in lower extremities. Past medical history included seizure disorder and splenectomy due to motor vehicle accident. He denied any history of syncope in the past. Family history was negative for sudden cardiac death or cardiac problem. He was homeless. He smoked 1 pack/day for 20 years and used cocaine and heroin. He was allergic to penicillin.Physical examination showed vitals of blood pressure of 80/57 mmHg, heart rate of 88/minute, respiratory rate of 18/minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen through nasal cannula, and temperature of 97°F. He was awake and alert and well oriented to time and place. His power on both lower extremities was 0/5 with decreased touch sensation. There was no back tenderness or deformity. Anal tone was intact. Lungs were clear. Mucous membranes were dry. Heart exam showed regular normal first and second heart sounds with no murmur. Abdomen was benign. His lower extremities showed black gangrenous area on right calf that was swollen and tense.His laboratory data showed potassium of 8.2 mEq/L (3.5–5 mEq/L) on nonhemolysed sample. Other laboratory data were as follows: Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 40 mg/dL (8–26 mg/dL), creatinine 4 mg/dL (0.5–1.5 mg/dL), sodium 135 mEq/L (135–145 mEq/L), chloride 98 mEq/L (98–108 mEq/L), serum bicarbonate 13 mEq/L (24–30 mEq/L), magnesium 2.2 mEq/L, hemoglobin 16.7 g/dL (12–17 G/dL), white count 23,000/mm3 (4800–11,000/mm3), platelet count 308,000/mm3 (150,000–400,000/mm3), INR 1.3, CPK 46,6879 units/L, CK-MB 0.377 ng/mL (<5 ng/mL), troponin 0.66 (<1 ng/mL), AST 1630 U/L (9–48 U/L), ALT 372 U/L (5–40 U/L), alkaline phosphatase 100 U/L (56–119 U/L), total bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL (0.2–1.2 mg/dL), and GGT 7 U/L (8–54 U/L). Urinalysis was significant for +3 blood with 5–9 RBC and +2 proteinuria; urine specific gravity was 1.009. His urine was positive for myoglobin. His chest X-ray was clear. MRI thoracolumbar spine did not show any spinal cord abnormality. His EKG was consistent with type 1 Brugada pattern on presentation (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed normal systolic and diastolic function with no valvular abnormality.43-year-old male presented with profound leg weakness, acute renal failure, severe hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, and compartment syndrome. He was severely dehydrated. His hyperkalemia was treated with calcium gluconate, insulin, glucose, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. He was aggressively hydrated with bicarbonate solution. Emergent fasciotomy was done for his compartment syndrome. His leg weakness was attributed to severe hyperkalemia that was resolved later on along the course of his hospital stay. MRI thoracolumbar spine did not show any spinal cord abnormality. His electrocardiogram showed type 1 Brugada pattern induced by severe hyperkalemia and it was resolved after potassium became normal (Figure 2). Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) was initiated due to anuric acute renal failure and after 8 sessions of IHD, his kidney functions recovered. His hospital course was complicated by MSSA bacteremia, which was adequately treated with antibiotics. He was transferred to rehabilitation facility in a stable condition.First introduced in 1992, BrS is a hereditary disorder (autosomal dominant with variable expression) associated with syncope, life threatening arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death [1]. It is defined as characteristic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes associated with one or more of the following clinical findings: documented ventricular fibrillation (VF), polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), family history of sudden cardiac death at age younger than 45 years, family history of type 1 Brugada pattern ECG changes, inducible VT during electrophysiology study, and unexplained syncope suggestive of a tachyarrhythmia or nocturnal agonal respiration [2].Three characteristic ECG patterns have been described in BrS. Type 1 ECG findings include spontaneous or drug induced (intravenous Class I antiarrhythmic drugs) ST segment elevation (≥2 mm) with an upward convexity “coved type” and a T-wave inversion. Type 2 Brugada pattern has ≥2 mm ST elevation with “saddle back” morphology, a trough ≥1 mm ST elevation, and then either a positive or biphasic T wave. Type 3 Brugada pattern has either coved type 1 or type 2 saddle back configuration but ST elevation is <1 mm. Interestingly, presence of type 2 and type 3 ECG patterns is not diagnostic of BrS. It requires reproduction of type 1 ECG pattern on drug provocative test to confirm BrS. All 3 types are characterized by ECG changes limited to the right precordial leads, V1 to V3, positioned in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th intercostal space. Axis is usually normal and QRS complex is narrow or mildly widened [3].Clinical manifestations associated with BrS range from chest pain, syncope, to SCD (more often at night, responsible for 4% of all SCD). Actual data on the true prevalence of BrS is not available. However, it is more prevalent in Asian and Southeast Asian populations such as Thailand, Philippines, and Japan as high as 0.5–1 per 1000. Males have 8–10 times higher chance of having BrS as compared with females [2, 3].BrS has traditionally been reported as an electrical disorder in the absence of structural heart disease. Recent research documents reveal some evidence of structural or pathological changes especially of the right ventricle. Most recently Gray et al. have raised an interesting concept of BrS as being a heterogeneous disorder with common ECG changes with or without structural heart defect. Structural heart abnormalities include subtle morphological changes in the right ventricular such as dilated right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) or histological finding of fibrofatty infiltration or inflammation of RVOT [4].So far 12 genes have been reported to be involved in encoding for sodium, calcium, or potassium channels. The most common one is a loss of function mutation in the gene SCN5A, encoding for alpha subunit of cardiac sodium channels. Brugada phenotype has been associated with genes involving either decrease in the inward sodium or calcium current or increase in outward potassium current. More broadly we can define BrS as genetic disorder of channelopathy with a combination of functional defects in the repolarization and/or depolarization phase and localized structural abnormality leading to common phenotype [5].Brugada pattern (BrP) ECG or Brugada sign is termed when characteristics ECG findings of BrS are observed in an asymptomatic patient with no other criteria. Our case demonstrated reversible ECG features and did not have any of the characteristics in the criteria. With correction of hyperkalemia, spontaneous resolution of Brugada sign was noted. So, we did not proceed with electrophysiological study.Recognition of BrS from BrP is crucial as BrS has an increased risk of SCD and may require treatment. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has shown clear evidence in preventing life threatening arrhythmias and SCD. The 2013 expert consensus guidelines by HRS/EHRA/APHRS strongly recommend ICD implantation in patients with aborted SCD and/or sustained VT with or without syncope. Pharmacological treatment like quinidine can be used in patients in whom ICD is indicated but cannot be implanted (patient refusal or contraindication), arrhythmic storms (more than 2 episodes of VT/VF in 24 hours) and history of sustained supraventricular arrhythmias. Anecdotal case reports have documented benefit of radiofrequency catheter ablation but further studies are needed to prove its long-term substantial efficacy. Family history of SCD or drug provoked BrP or asymptomatic BrS is not an indication for ICD implantation as risk of critical events is very low. Currently, the roles of electrophysiological study or a pertinent family history of SCD remains debatable [3].BrP ECG is a rare but challenging finding. It draws physician’s attention to rule out BrS as a possible diagnosis. There are many conditions that can induce BrP ECG, sometimes making it difficult to separate it from genetic BrS. Reversible BrP ECG changes have been reported to occur due to electrolyte disturbances like hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, acidosis, hyperglycemia, cocaine, alcohol, drugs like neuroleptics or tricyclic antidepressants, type 1C antiarrhythmic, fever, and electrocution [6–10].Hyperkalemia is a very common and potentially life threatening electrolyte disorder. It is associated with wide variety of ECG changes ranging from minimal ECG changes to arrhythmias and sine wave pattern [11]. Rare ECG manifestations of hyperkalemia include ST elevation and reversible BrP [12, 13]; since data is limited to case reports only, exact electrophysiological mechanism is uncertain. It is predicted that with increasing level of potassium concentration, progressive ECG changes will be observed but this relationship sometimes is not evident [14] (Table 1). Severe hyperkalemia, in rare circumstances, can be associated with minimal ECG findings lacking characteristic hyperkalemia related features or even normal ECG. Hyperkalemia related ECG changes are more likely to be severe and progressive in the setting of concurrent occurrence of metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia. Conversely, metabolic alkalosis, hypercalcemia, and hypernatremia can mask the effects of hyperkalemia on membrane potential minimizing typical ECG changes [15–17].Presumably severe hyperkalemia inactivates the cardiac sodium ion channels by decreasing the resting membrane potential. It has been observed mainly in critically ill male population. Widened QRS complex and absent P waves sometimes seen in hyperkalemia induced BrP can help distinguish it from genetic BrS [18]. Our patient did not reveal widened QRS or absent P wave making it even more difficult to differentiate but he did not meet the other criteria for genetic BrS. To our knowledge, only 27 case reports have been reported where hyperkalemia related BrP was described.Brugada pattern ECG changes can occur in the setting of hyperkalemia, and these changes are reversible upon correction of this common electrolyte abnormality.Prompt recognition and early treatment of hyperkalemia can be lifesaving. They can completely reverse these changes and avoid the unnecessary interventions. Physicians should be mindful of this rare presentation of a very common electrolyte disorder.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Singleton Merten Syndrome: A Rare Cause of Early Onset Aortic Stenosis

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Singleton Merten syndrome (SMS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder with variable expression. Its characteristic features include abnormal aortic calcification, abnormal ossification of extremities, and dental anomalies. We present a young man with dyspnea who was noted to have aortic stenosis in the background of glaucoma, psoriasis, dental anomalies, hand and foot deformities, Achilles tendinitis, osteopenia, and nephrolithiasis. The conglomeration of features led to the diagnosis of SMS. His mother had a very similar phenotype.SMS is an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expression [1]. It is associated with abnormal calcification in vascular and connective tissues causing aortic calcification and aortic valve stenosis [1]. The pathophysiology of abnormal calcification is unknown but is likely linked to gain-of-function IFIH1 mutation [2]. We had a young male patient who presented for dyspnea and palpitations and was noted to have mild aortic stenosis.A 30-year-old male with a past medical history of early onset glaucoma, multiple trabeculectomies, delayed eruption of permanent dentition, progressive hand deformities (Figure 1), psoriasis, recurrent nephrolithiasis, Achilles tendinitis, tendon rupture, foot deformities (Figure 2), and hypoplastic toe nails presented for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion and palpitations. Symptoms have been ongoing for three months with gradual worsening. His family history was significant for premature coronary artery disease in his mother and aortic stenosis with aortic valve replacement when she was 31 years old.Physical examination showed grade 3/6 systolic murmur in the left second intercostal space, hallux valgus deformities in the feet (Figure 2), and dysplastic dentition (Figure 3).The patient underwent an echocardiogram which revealed moderate mitral annular calcification, mild aortic stenosis (Figure 4) with partial fusion of noncoronary and left coronary cusps, and calcified leaflets, with a peak gradient of 24.4 mm Hg and mean gradient of 13 mm Hg and peak velocity of 2.47 m/s. Thirty-day event recorder was unremarkable. Imaging revealed minimal hyperostosis at triceps insertion on the ulna. It also revealed right hallux valgus deformity and peritendinous calcification of bilateral patellar tendons. CT chest revealed minimal calcification of aortic arch and abdominal aorta, calcification of aortic valve, and ductus arteriosus remnant. Genetic testing revealed autosomal dominant IFIH1 mutation.Repeat echocardiogram in one year showed moderate aortic stenosis with peak velocity of 3.16 m/s, peak gradient of 40 mmHg and mean gradient of 20 mmHg, and aortic valve of 0.98 cm2.Our patient had features similar to Singleton Merten syndrome including glaucoma, dysplastic permanent teeth, multiple tendon rupture, and extensive vascular calcification. Singleton Merten syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expression. His mother had a similar phenotype.SMS is a rare disease, with very few cases reported in the literature. Common features include abnormal aortic calcification, abnormal ossification of extremities, and dental anomalies [3, 4]. Other associated features are glaucoma, psoriasis [4], tendinitis, and osteoporosis [1].The pathophysiology of the disease is unclear in regard to the abnormal calcification of vascular and connective tissues with a possible link to abnormal calcium metabolism [1, 5]. Our patient had normal laboratory evaluation for calcium metabolism. Genetic testing in subjects with SMS has revealed a gain-of-function IFIH1 mutation likely causing premature arterial calcification and dental inflammation [2].The patient is currently followed up by a multidisciplinary team and is being monitored for the progression of aortic stenosis.Although this disease is not unique, not many cases have been described before. Due to its rarity, we hope this case would help in understanding this rare and complex disease.The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Right Ventricular Compression Mimicking Brugada-Like Electrocardiogram in a Patient with Recurrent Pectus Excavatum

PE usually has a benign course; however, this chest deformity may be associated with symptomatic tachyarrhythmias due to mechanical compression. We report a case of a patient with recurrent PE after surgical correction presenting with palpitation and electrocardiogram (ECG) showing ST-segment elevation on the right precordial leads, which could be mistaken for a Brugada syndrome (BrS).Pectus excavatum (PE) is the most common congenital deformity of the anterior chest wall with male predominance [1]. Surgical correction with modified Ravitch or Nuss technique is sometimes performed, but recurrent PE is not uncommon [1]. Indications of the operation for PE are various, of those, symptomatic tachyarrhythmia is one of the important reasons [2]. As a consequence of mechanical compression, PE leads to structural or hemodynamic consequences which may be proarrhythmic [2, 3]. We report a case of young man with recurrent PE after the first surgical correction at the age of 3. He presented with palpitation and his electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation on the right precordial leads, which could be mistaken for a Brugada syndrome (BrS).A 23-year-old man presented with palpitation, which occurred abruptly during resting state and lasted 10 minutes. He has been healthy except a past history of surgical correction for PE 20 years prior. He denied having episodes of syncope or a family history of sudden cardiac arrest. At present, physical examination revealed a deformity of the anterior thoracic cage consistent with PE (Figure 1(a)). ECG revealed an rSR’ pattern with slight ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion on the right precordial leads, indicating a Brugada-like ECG pattern (Figure 2(a)). Laboratory findings were within normal range. Both signal-averaged ECG and flecainide challenge test showed no significant findings. During treadmill testing, no tachyarrhythmia was noted except an infrequent single ventricular premature beat at stage 4. Twenty-four hour ambulatory Holter monitoring revealed several episodes of sustained atrial tachycardia with a maximum duration of 5 minutes (Figure 2(c)). Echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography demonstrated external compression on the basal-to-mid portion of the right ventricle (RV) and dilation of the right atrium and RV apical site with mild hypokinesia (Figures 1(b) and 3(a)). Haller index which is defined as the ratio of the transverse (the horizontal distance of ribcage) and the anteroposterior diameter (the shortest distance between the sternum and vertebrae) was 5.21. Based on these data, the patient’s symptom was most likely due to atrial tachycardia. Nuss operation was carried out, and postoperative chest X-ray demonstrated effective prevention of sternal compression (Figure 3(b)). Follow-up echocardiography revealed that the RV was decompressed, leading to normal contractility. During a six-month follow-up period, no symptoms were reported and no tachyarrhythmias were documented. ST-segment morphology seemed to be normalized on lead  (Figure 2(b)).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of PE provoking atrial tachycardia and mimicking a Brugada-like ECG pattern via extrinsic compression of the RV, even though he underwent a prior operation for chest wall deformity. The first surgical correction performed at the age of 3 could not keep pace with chest wall expansion as the patient matured.Indications of surgical correction for PE included cosmetic matter, progression of the deformity, Haller index > 3.0, structural compression or displacement resulting in paradoxical movement of the chest wall or any cardiac pathology, or frequent symptoms such as dyspnea, palpitation, or easy fatigue [4]. However, recurrent PE is not uncommon. One of the reasons for recurrence is surgical timing. Usually repair is postponed until the later stages of teenage to allow complete skeletal maturity [5]. Younger children with cardiopulmonary compromise may be candidates for early repair as our patient. Nevertheless, deformity correction at too early of the age can lead to improper growth of chest wall and then have a higher chance of recurrence [6]. Other suggested reasons of PE recurrence include too extensive or too small dissection, inherent cartilage dysfunction, ossified costal cartilages, or tight adhesion between chest wall soft tissue and bone after operation [1].PE presents with various ECG abnormalities including symptomatic tachyarrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia that rarely require catheter ablation [4]. In this patient atrial tachycardia was documented. Probably it was provoked due to atrial bulging and hemodynamic changes caused by chronic mechanical compression on RV. Because this compression was considered as a source of arrhythmogenesis, surgical correction was performed and then no more tachycardia has been documented thereafter.Brugada phenocopy (BrP), a recently established clinical phenomenon that is distinct from BrS, can be caused by mechanical mediastinal compression on RV [7]. BrP is defined as a typical Brugada morphology in the absence of true BrS and this pattern resolves once the underlying predisposing condition is relieved [8]. In this patient, BrS was suspected based on well-defined peaked , slight ST-segment elevation combined with T-wave inversion on the right precordial leads. In addition, the ratio of amplitude of ST-segment at J-point and the point 80 ms after J-point was higher than 1 and QRS duration in left leads was not wider than 120 ms [8]. However, it was less likely in that flecainide provocation testing was definitely negative and there was no history of syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or family history compatible with BrS. Also, even though ST-segment morphology was not fully recovered yet, it seemed to be normalized after the surgical correction. The mechanism of BrP in PE is suggested to be most likely due to chronic mechanical compression, anatomical displacement, and rotation which affect multiple ion channels leading to increase in outward currents during the early phase of the epicardial action potential [7, 9].As shown in this case, PE is one of the causes of BrP and it can also provoke atrial tachycardia. Also, before surgical correction for PE, proper operation timing should be deliberate. While PE is typically considered a benign condition, surgical correction may be needed if associated cardiac symptoms appear even after a prior correction [9].The authors have no competing interests.All authors had access to the data and participated in the preparation of the manuscript and approved this manuscript.
Aspergillus Pericarditis with Tamponade in a Renal Transplant Patient
Albert Einstein Medical Center, 5501 Old York Road, Philadelphia, PA 19141,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Sylvia Biso; ude.nietsnie@vlysosibReceived 13 October 2016; Accepted 2 February 2017; Published 20 February 2017Academic Editor: Expedito E. RibeiroCopyright © 2017 Sylvia Biso et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Aspergillus pericarditis is a rare and life-threatening infection in immunosuppressed patients. It has nonspecific clinical manifestations that often mimic other disease entities especially in patients who have extensive comorbidities. Diagnosis is oftentimes delayed and rarely done antemortem. A high degree of suspicion in immunocompromised patients is necessary for evaluation and timely diagnosis. This is a case of Aspergillus pericarditis with cardiac tamponade in a renal transplant patient with liver cirrhosis. Two months after transplant, he developed decompensation of his cirrhosis from hepatitis C, acute cellular rejection, and Kluyvera bacteremia, followed by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) bacteremia. Four months after transplant, the patient presented with lethargy and fluid overload. He subsequently developed shock and ventilator-dependent respiratory failure. An echocardiogram showed pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. He had emergent pericardiocentesis that showed purulent drainage. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Amphotericin B was initiated when the pericardial fluid grew mold that was later identified as Aspergillus fumigatus. The patient quickly decompensated and expired.Pericardial aspergillosis is a fatal opportunistic infection in immunosuppressed patients. It is oftentimes difficult to diagnose because of the lack of characteristic signs and symptoms. Risk factors for predisposing for this infection include transplant patients, neutropenic, AIDS, and chronic granulomatous disease patients, and patients receiving steroids or immunosuppressive regimens [1]. The most common site of infection is the lung and it accounts for 70% of the cases. This reflects the lungs as the port of entry. In a study by Lin et al., the distribution of patients according to site or type of aspergillosis is as follows: disseminated or CNS infections (9%), sinusitis (2.7%), tracheobronchitis (2.3%), multisite (5.9%), and cutaneous, other, or unspecified (10.3%) [2]. Cardiac aspergillosis is uncommon and often occurs as endocarditis or myocarditis. Isolated pericardial involvement is rare and not usually diagnosed antemortem. In a study of 60 patients with fungal cardiac infections, the most common cause was Candida (62%). Aspergillus and phycomycetes were second at 12% each [3]. We report a case of Aspergillus pericarditis with tamponade in a renal transplant patient with liver cirrhosis.The patient is a 61-year-old male with end stage renal disease from hypertension with cadaveric renal transplant recipient who developed acute decompensated liver cirrhosis from viral hepatitis C after transplant.Two months after transplant, he had several episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, urinary tract infections, and cardiac arrest with acute allograft dysfunction requiring renal replacement therapies. His mycophenolate mofetil was held. The transplant kidney biopsy showed evidence of acute cellular rejection with acute tubular necrosis that was treated with high-dose steroids. However, his allograft function never recovered and he required supportive hemodialysis. He also developed Kluyvera bacteremia followed by VRE bacteremia.Four months after transplant, the patient presented with altered mental status and severe volume overload. On admission, the patient was lethargic, afebrile, and normotensive but tachycardic. Physical examination revealed severe anasarca and asterixis with no focal deficit. Diagnosis of metabolic encephalopathy was entertained. Urgent hemodialysis for uremia was started. His lactulose was increased for presumed hepatic encephalopathy without any improvement.On the 5th hospital day, the patient suddenly became unresponsive, hypotensive with shock, hypoxic, and febrile. He was intubated and started on vasopressors. Chest X-ray showed left lower lobe consolidation, but did not reveal cardiomegaly. His ECG showed diffuse ST segment elevations. PR segment depressions, electrical alternans, and low QRS voltage were absent. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate size pericardial effusion localized circumferentially. This was accompanied by right ventricular compression with tamponade physiology. The patient had emergent pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement. A total of 320 ml of purulent fluid was drained. His blood pressure improved and he was taken off vasopressors. He was also started on daptomycin and cefepime.On the 6th hospital day, the patient continued to be lethargic. A CT scan of the head showed evidence of multifocal infarctions. Subsequent MRI of the brain revealed multiple septic emboli (Figure 1). These results raised suspicion of infective endocarditis for which a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed. TEE showed possible small mitral valve vegetations (Figure 2) and resolution of the pericardial effusion. Blood cultures grew vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The hemodialysis catheter was changed over the wire and culture of the catheter tip was subsequently found to be negative. Cefepime was switched to ceftaroline for better daptomycin binding to bacterial membrane.On the 7th hospital day, mold grew in pericardial fluid culture. Amphotericin B was initiated to cover both Aspergillus and Mucor. The patient continued to clinically deteriorate and went into septic shock. The family gave him a do-not-resuscitate status and he expired on the 7th hospital day. The mold was eventually identified as Aspergillus fumigatus 10 days after the patient died.Cardiac aspergillosis remains a diagnostic challenge especially without prior established pulmonary aspergillosis. A high degree clinical suspicion on an immunocompromised patient is needed to direct the clinical investigation. There are currently thirty-two cases of pericardial aspergillosis found in literature. Eight had clinical signs of cardiac tamponade. Only three, including our case, did not have established pulmonary or other forms of aspergillosis. Most diagnoses were postmortem. Only six out of the thirty-two were cured.Among patients predisposed to aspergillosis, cancer is the most common underlying medical condition (44%), followed by bone marrow transplant (25%), solid-organ transplant (13%), HIV/AIDS (3.8), autoimmune (2%), and systemic steroid use (3.5%). Our patient is a renal transplant patient with concurrent immunosuppressant use. His clinical course was complicated by acute decompensated liver cirrhosis, acute renal allograft dysfunction, and severe infections within two months of renal transplant. These extensive comorbidities made him susceptible to opportunistic infections. Four months after his renal transplant, he had aspergillosis pericarditis with tamponade that eventually led to his demise.Weiland et al. [4] studied the clinical pattern of aspergillosis in renal transplant patients. The median time between aspergillosis infection and transplantation was found to be three and a half months. For patients with history of acute rejection, aspergillosis occurred within two months of treatment of acute rejection. These data are consistent with the clinical course of our patient. Weiland et al. also found that aspergillosis took place alongside other illnesses. The most common associated infection was CMV followed by bacterial infections. One-fourth of patients affected were also multiple transplant recipients. Weiland et al. concluded that for renal transplant patients, patients with CMV, recent acute rejection and recipients of multiple transplants appear to be more susceptible to aspergillosis.The clinical features of cardiac aspergillosis are nonspecific and often depend on which part of the heart is involved. Myocardial aspergillosis is the most common form of the infection and can account to up to 83% of cases. It may occur alone but often with endocarditis or pericarditis. It is often asymptomatic, although it can manifest as a conduction abnormality and is usually diagnosed during autopsy [5].Aspergillosis endocarditis occurs in 17% of patients and presents as fever, embolic episodes, or heart murmur. Unlike Aspergillus endocarditis where large vegetations are easily seen in echocardiography, myocardial or pericardial aspergillosis are harder to detect [5]. Our patient had septic emboli to the brain, a frequent sequelae of endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiogram did reveal possible small valvular vegetations. This shows that the patient may have accompanying infective endocarditis. Embolic events in the setting of aspergillosis without significant valvular vegetations may also signify mural endocarditis [6]. Aspergillus mural endocarditis is not always apparent in echocardiograms and may start off as a subendocardial focus before developing into an abscess [7].Aspergillus is difficult to grow in blood cultures. Our hospital uses Bactec Fx culture system and requires 5–7 ml of blood sample per culture bottle. In this patient, a bottle of blood culture on admission did not grow any organism. On day 5, when the patient was clinically deteriorating, repeat blood cultures consisting of two bottles only grew Enterococcus faecium. On day 6, repeat blood cultures again showed no growth in one bottle and E. faecium in the second bottle. It was only in the pericardial fluid fungal culture collected on day 5 that Aspergillus fumigatus was demonstrated and grown.Aspergillus pericarditis occurs in multisite infections and is seen in 17% of cardiac aspergillosis [5]. It presents as chest pain, hypotension, tamponade, or pericardial friction rub. In our patient, diffuse ST segment elevations and hypotension pointed towards cardiac tamponade. Before this, his lethargy was attributed to metabolic encephalopathy. The patient, however, quickly deteriorated and eventually expired.The initial therapy for invasive aspergillosis is voriconazole, a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal. It has been shown to be more effective than amphotericin B and is associated with lower mortality rate [8]. Our patient, on the other hand, was started on amphotericin B when pericardial fluid revealed mold. This is to cover for both Aspergillus and Mucor. Mucor is another mold infection that occurs in transplant patients and voriconazole does not have anti-Mucor activity. Furthermore, for patients who have liver disease like ours or for patients who cannot tolerate voriconazole, a lipid formulation of amphotericin B is the next alternative to voriconazole.Other treatment strategies involve combination therapy of voriconazole and echinocandins. The combination therapy may be used as primary treatment or as salvage therapy. The dual therapy was shown to have superior outcomes than voriconazole alone in one study [9]. Echinocandins, however, are not used as initial monotherapy of aspergillosis. They can be used as salvage therapy for those who cannot tolerate or are refractory to triazoles.Invasive aspergillosis portends a poor prognosis and has a case fatality rate (CFR) of 58%. The CFR for liver transplant patients is 67.6, while kidney transplant patients’ CFR is 62.5% [2]. For pericardial aspergillosis, only six out of thirty-two patients of the cases published in literature have been cured. Factors that contributed to the survival of the six patients were early detection, recovery from immunosuppression, pericardiectomy, and combination antifungal therapy [10].In conclusion, pericardial aspergillosis is a rare and fatal disease in immunosuppressed patients. It is often insidious and has nonspecific clinical manifestations. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required for early detection and diagnosis. Once diagnosed, aggressive treatment is warranted.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Augmenting Function for Infarction from Infection: Impella 2.5 for Ischemic Cardiogenic Shock Complicating Sepsis

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Cardiac dysfunction is a common complication of sepsis in individuals with preexisting coronary disease and portends a poor prognosis when progressing to ischemic cardiogenic shock. In this setting, maximal medical therapy in isolation is often inadequate to maintain cardiac output for patients who are poor candidates for immediate revascularization. Furthermore, the use of vasopressors and inotropes increases myocardial demand and may lead to further injury. Percutaneous ventricular assist devices provide a viable option for management of severe shock with multiorgan failure. The Impella is one of several novel mechanical support systems that can effectively augment cardiac output while reducing myocardial demand and serve as a bridge to recovery from severe hemodynamic compromise. This case report describes the successful utilization of the Impella 2.5 in a patient with baseline profound anemia and coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting in combined distributive and cardiogenic shock associated with a type 2 myocardial infarction complicating sepsis.The Impella is a temporary mechanical support device that can bridge a patient with severe cardiac dysfunction to either recovery or further therapy. Conventionally, these devices are utilized in patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention [1, 2] or with acute cardiogenic shock [3]. We describe the successful utilization of the Impella 2.5 in a patient with baseline profound anemia and coronary artery disease presenting in combined distributive and cardiogenic shock complicating sepsis.A 66-year-old woman presented to an outside hospital with several weeks of progressive shortness of breath and weakness. Vitals on arrival were heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/59 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute without hypoxemia. Physical exam revealed respiratory distress, no abdominal tenderness, diminished pulses throughout, and no evidence of bleeding. Notable laboratory data were 19,000 white blood cells/μL, hemoglobin 4.4 g/dL, troponin 4 ng/mL, lactate 10.6 mmol/L, and urinalysis consistent with urinary tract infection. Electrocardiogram revealed inferolateral ST depressions, and a chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. She received broad-spectrum antibiotics and four units of packed red blood cells but required intubation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, progressive confusion, and shock refractory to stress-dose steroids and vasopressors. The patient was transferred to our medical intensive care unit for further care.On arrival to our intensive care unit, the patient presented intubated and on multiple pressors but had preserved mentation and purposeful movement. Despite medical optimization with the addition of an inotrope and titration of vasopressors to a mean arterial pressure of ≥65 mmHg, she developed anuric renal failure. Repeat blood work showed persistently elevated lactate of 8.0 mmol/L, worsening leukocytosis to 56,000 cells/μL, and troponin markedly elevated at 105 ng/mL. Chest radiograph demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema. Electrocardiogram was notable for anterolateral ST depressions and ST elevations in aVR and V1 concerning for left main disease. Bedside echocardiography demonstrated depressed left ventricular function with an estimated ejection fraction of 30% and wall motion abnormalities in the left anterior descending coronary artery distribution. Her APACHE II score at that time was 36, corresponding to a predicted mortality rate of 82%. Given the conflicting need for high-dose pressors and evidence of myocardial ischemia potentially made worse by the same pressors, the decision was made to pursue coronary angiography and consideration for mechanical hemodynamic support. Left heart catheterization revealed proximal left main, severe ostial left anterior descending artery disease of 70%, and moderate right coronary artery disease (Figure 1). Right heart catheterization revealed elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure of 32 mmHg, wedge pressure of 18 mmHg, and low-normal cardiac index of 2.95 L/min per square meter (L/min/m2) while on high-level vasopressors. Although no acute plaque rupture was noted on angiography, her ostial left anterior descending artery disease was thought to be the likely site responsible for the myocardial ischemia contributing to her shock. Because percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of this high-risk lesion in a critically ill patient could lead to further instability, PCI was deferred and mechanical circulatory support was initiated with an Impella 2.5 device (Abiomed, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA). Postintervention laboratory indices and urine output improved within minutes along with decreasing vasopressor requirements. The Impella delivered an average 2 L/min of flow and was removed at approximately 72 hours, after vasopressors were weaned off entirely (Figure 2).After a total of one week in the ICU for invasive hemodynamic and respiratory support, the patient was transferred to the medical floor on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula. During that time, her lactate, troponin, and creatinine normalized. Final blood and sputum cultures were negative, but urine cultures identified an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection as the likely source of her sepsis. The patient underwent 2-vessel coronary artery bypass graft two weeks from her initial presentation and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Her outpatient anemia evaluation identified a colonic adenocarcinoma, for which she received a successful right hemicolectomy three months after discharge. A phone call over one year following discharge found her to be in good spirits and functioning independently at home.In this case, we describe the use of an Impella 2.5 device to provide mechanical circulatory support to a patient with coronary artery disease and anemia presenting with distributive septic shock from a urinary tract infection, further complicated by ischemic cardiogenic shock. The patient’s hemodynamic compromise despite maximal medical therapy and active myocardial ischemia, as evidenced by electrocardiogram and marked troponin elevation, led to an invasive cardiac evaluation. Severe left main disease on left heart catheterization provided supportive evidence for the contribution of ongoing myocardial ischemia to her septic shock. The acuity and degree of her illness warranted immediate mechanical circulatory support in an attempt to halt the cycle of cardiogenic shock and ongoing ischemia refractory to inotropic and vasopressor therapy. Device deployment led to rapid improvement of serum lactate, decreased vasopressor requirements, and resumption of urine output within 15 minutes. This rate of recovery of renal function is biologically plausible and analogous to the timing of onset of urine production observed during renal transplantation [5]. Mechanical augmentation of cardiac output and aggressive diuresis also led to brisk improvement of respiratory function, as evidenced by decreasing ventilator requirements and prompt clearance of bilateral opacities on serial chest radiography. In this context, the source of respiratory distress was more consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema than from a primary infectious respiratory source.Although sepsis is not an absolute contraindication to mechanical hemodynamic support, using a foreign device in a septic patient is generally avoided when possible. However, in the described case, the patient’s dire need for unloading the myocardium while providing supplemental cardiac output outweighed the concern for introducing a new nidus of infection. The successful utilization of the Impella and favorable outcome in this patient suggest a possible role for such mechanical hemodynamic support devices in patients with cardiac ischemia complicating sepsis. Currently, therapeutic options for critically ill patients with refractory shock are limited to cardioactive medications (i.e., vasopressors, inotropes), intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), extracorporeal life support, and now the utilization of microaxial pumps such as the Impella.While primarily used for cardiogenic shock and support during percutaneous coronary intervention, the use of the Impella has also recently been described in transcatheter aortic valve replacement [6] and fulminant myocarditis [7, 8]. Its two smaller percutaneous models, the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP, provide 2.5 and 4.0 L/min of support, respectively, and its larger surgically implanted model, the Impella 5.0, delivers 5 L/min of support. The Impella CP is frequently favored due its smaller size and relative ease of insertion in the common femoral artery with a 14-French introducer sheath via Seldinger technique under fluoroscopic guidance in the catheterization laboratory. In contrast, the Impella 5.0 requires surgical cut-down to the axillary artery and a cardiac surgery team for device insertion. Its use is contraindicated in the presence of a prosthetic aortic valve, aortic valve stenosis, moderate-to-severe aortic insufficiency, severe aortic or peripheral artery disease, or severe bleeding diatheses. Despite the potential for complications such as bleeding, hemolysis, and catheter drift, the Impella exhibits safety comparable to the IABP [1, 9, 10].The Impella has increasingly gained favor due to its ability to augment cardiac output to a greater extent than the IABP [9, 10]. The majority of the literature to date has compared the use of microaxial pump devices, such as the Impella, to IABP in those with primary cardiogenic shock. Although several studies have demonstrated advantages of the Impella, including increased hemodynamic support without significant increases in insertion or postprocedural complications, improved mortality with its use has yet to be established [2, 3, 9]. Despite being halted prematurely for futility based on an interim analysis, the PROTECT II trial, which compared the Impella to IABP in high-risk patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention, revealed trends toward improved 90-day mortality in the Impella group [2]. Post hoc analysis indicated that the first patients to receive the Impella at each participating site experienced more major adverse effects than those receiving the IABP. However, after excluding the first patient per group at each site, significantly lower 90-day major adverse events were observed with the Impella (38.0% versus 50.0%  ). This suggests a learning curve associated with its insertion and potential for superior outcomes when utilized by practitioners familiar with the device [11].A paradigm shift has occurred since the introduction of the microaxial devices. Although less is understood about their medical complications compared to other forms of mechanical support such as surgically implanted ventricular assist devices [12], the relative ease of micro-axial device deployment makes it an appealing option in the proper circumstance. Their use has notably increased in high-risk percutaneous intervention, advanced heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction with or without cardiogenic shock, but use in other clinical scenarios has been fairly limited until recently [13]. While Impella use is well described in postcardiotomy, fulminant myocarditis, and cardiac arrest, we are not aware of prior reports describing Impella use for cardiogenic shock in patients with type 2 NSTEMI secondary to sepsis.Complex patients like the one presented are not uncommon in the intensive care unit. Epidemiological reports establish patients over the age of 65 now account for 45% of the intensive care unit population [14]. These patients often have numerous comorbidities such as advanced coronary artery disease and anemia predisposing to multifactorial hemodynamic compromise. A recent CDC report estimates the prevalence of coronary artery disease in elderly Americans is almost 20% [15]. Additionally, sepsis disproportionally afflicts the elderly, with nearly 40% of those admitted for septicemia being between the ages of 65 and 84 [16].Despite advances in intensive care, sepsis remains a leading cause of death in noncardiac intensive care units, with an estimated mortality of 25 to 30% [17, 18]. Shock, whether of septic or cardiac origin, portends a poor prognosis when presenting in isolation and is conceivably worse when diagnosed in tandem. The burgeoning elderly population, which is disproportionately affected by both coronary artery disease and sepsis, will test our therapeutic options and require novel approaches for providing the necessary hemodynamic augmentation to overcome acute shock. For example, although our patient was provided sufficient red blood cells to correct her nonhemorrhagic anemia and appropriate antibiotics for her urosepsis, the degree of her shock was beyond the capability of medical therapy to yield a good outcome. For such patients in whom optimal medical therapy fails for the treatment of multifactorial shock, the Impella may be a viable alternative, even in the setting of sepsis. As with any time-dependent disease process, its early initiation in the judiciously screened patient may yield encouraging results.The authors have no competing interests.
Type 1 Kounis Syndrome in Patient with Idiopathic Anaphylaxis
Department of Internal Medicine, General Hospital Slovenj Gradec, Gosposvetska 1, SI-2380 Slovenj Gradec,  SloveniaCorrespondence should be addressed to Tajda Keber; moc.liamg@rebek.adjatReceived 25 November 2016; Accepted 18 January 2017; Published 31 January 2017Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2017 Tajda Keber et al.

It can be associated with normal coronary angiogram or preexistent coronary pathology. Idiopathic anaphylaxis is defined as anaphylaxis without any identifiable precipitating agent or event. We present a case of male who experienced attacks of dyspnoea, hypoxemia, hypotension, purple-red skin, and chest pain over several years. He was diagnosed with idiopathic anaphylaxis. Based on the pattern of chest pain of ischemic origin during the attacks he was retrospectively diagnosed with Kounis syndrome.Chest pain and dyspnoea represent common complaints in emergency departments. Several most common life-threatening cardiovascular causes are usually searched for or ruled out in emergencies. Patients with rare or unusual aetiologies of complaints represent a minority and are often misdiagnosed and suboptimally treated. If the complaint has chronic nature patients are repeatedly sent to emergency departments. They are examined by different physicians with different ideas of underlying aetiology. The path to establish a right diagnosis is therefore long and can lead through many unnecessary diagnostic procedures. Kounis syndrome is not a rare aetiology based on literature but remains overlooked due to focus on the main complaint at the moment of presentation by the threating physician. Here we present a patient with combination of pathologies which can represent a dilemma for a threating physician in emergency situation.Overweight male smoker allergic to metamizol with known dyslipidaemia was examined due to dyspnoea with acute respiratory insufficiency multiple times over several years. The attacks started approximately at the age of forty-eight. He was not receiving any regular therapy at that time. He was tachycardic and hypotensive during attacks; his skin was coloured purple-red. His complaints were dyspnoea, nausea, and chest pain. He also claimed to have several weaker attacks at home approximately twice monthly.In the course of one of the attacks he fulfilled scintigraphic diagnostic criteria for pulmonary embolism. He was receiving oral anticoagulant treatment for one year.During one of the attacks he suffered acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI). He underwent coronarography which showed normal coronary arteries. It was concluded he suffered coronary artery spasm which caused STEMI. Therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker was started. Because of his complaints of occasional chest pain perfusion myocardial scintigraphy was performed. It showed no reversible myocardial ischemia and fully viable myocardium. He terminated calcium antagonist treatment.Due to patients’ physical appearance during the attack catecholamines’ values in urine sample were scanned several times. They were always under the cut-off value. Based on several under-cut-off values of 5-HIAA and negative scintigraphic scan for somatostatin receptors we also ruled out carcinoid syndrome.In the course of one of the attacks a serum tryptase sample was obtained. The tryptase was markedly elevated (57,5 μg/L) in comparison to tryptase value during asymptomatic state which was normal (4 μg/L). We therefore performed bone marrow biopsy which ruled out systemic mastocytosis.In suspicion of allergic aetiology of unknown origin treatment with acetylsalicylic acid was terminated. He was diagnosed with idiopathic anaphylaxis after he underwent a work-up for common allergies. He was advised not to use nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Treatment with antihistaminic loratadine was started which he randomly terminated after few months. After the termination of antihistaminic treatment he experienced worse symptoms during the attacks again. During one of the attacks after diagnosis of IA was made he received intramuscular adrenalin injection. His chest pain was aggravated for several minutes.He is currently on antihistaminic. Attacks in mild form are still present.The diagnosis of Kounis syndrome was made retrospectively after studying the pattern of repeating stenocardic chest pain experienced during anaphylactic events.Kounis syndrome is defined as the concurrence of acute coronary syndromes or anginal pain in conditions associated with mast-cell and platelet activation involving interrelated and interacting inflammatory cells in the setting of allergic or hypersensitivity and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid insults [1]. Causes capable of inducing Kounis syndrome include numerous drugs, environmental exposures, and conditions such as asthma, idiopathic anaphylaxis (as in the case of our patient), and mastocytosis [2].During hypersensitivity, degranulation of mast cells releases inflammatory mediators into the systemic circulation. Most of these mediators have important cardiovascular activity. Histamine induces coronary vasoconstriction and tissue factor expression and consequently activates platelets. Neutral proteases can activate matrix metalloproteinases, which can degrade the collagen cap and induce plaque erosion and rupture. Tryptase has thrombotic and fibrinolytic properties. Many mediators have vasoconstrictive properties and may worsen coronary vasospasm [1].The diagnosis of Kounis syndrome is based on clinical symptoms and signs as well as on laboratory, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and angiographic evidence. Increased serum tryptase, histamine, cardiac enzymes, and cardiac troponins are particularly helpful findings. Measuring cardiac troponins in all patients admitted to the emergency department with acute allergic reactions in order to timely diagnose and appropriately manage a potential cardiac injury manifesting as Kounis syndrome has been already suggested. Echocardiography and coronary angiography are necessary in diagnosing cardiac wall abnormalities including takotsubo cardiomyopathy and delineating the coronary anatomy [3].Our patient was retrogradely diagnosed with Kounis syndrome as the connection between allergic features and chest pain was established. Nevertheless, he experienced STEMI with normal coronary angiogram in the course of one of the attacks.Three variants of Kounis syndrome have been described: type I variant includes normal or nearly normal coronary arteries without risk factors for coronary artery disease and with the acute release of inflammatory mediators that may induce either coronary artery spasm without increased cardiac enzymes and troponins or coronary artery spasm progressing to acute myocardial infarction with raised cardiac enzymes and troponins. Type II variant includes culprit but quiescent preexisting atheromatous disease in which the acute release of inflammatory mediators may induce either coronary artery spasm or coronary artery spasm together with plaque erosion or rupture manifesting as acute myocardial infarction. Type III variant includes coronary artery stent thrombosis [1].Our patient is classified as type I variant.True frequency of Kounis syndrome is unknown. However, during insect sting challenge study 9,5% of healthy volunteers developed chest pain with electrocardiographic abnormalities consistent with acute myocardial ischemia [4].Idiopathic anaphylaxis (IA) is defined as anaphylaxis without any identifiable precipitating agent or event. The clinical manifestations include urticaria, angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, wheezing, stridor, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, flushing, diarrhoea, dysphagia, light-headedness, and loss of consciousness. Patients usually tend to have the same manifestations on repeated episodes. IA is a diagnosis of exclusion. Approximately 40% of patients are atopic. Serum tryptase (or urine histamine or its metabolite) will be elevated acutely [5].Our patient experienced typical symptoms during the attacks. Serum tryptase was also elevated.IA is classified according to the symptoms as well as the frequency of attacks. Patients who experience six or more episodes in a year or two or more episodes in 2 months are classified as IA-frequent (IA-F) [5].Patients with IA must carry and know when and how to self-administer epinephrine. All patients with IA should be advised to avoid taking drugs that might complicate treatment or worsen an event (β-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin blockers, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [5, 6]. If a patient is already known to experience frequent attacks of idiopathic anaphylaxis, empiric therapy with prednisone and H1 antagonist should be tried out. If the patient is asymptomatic, then prednisone can be tapered every 2 to 4 weeks until it is determined that the patient has had no more episodes of anaphylaxis and prednisone is not required or more episodes occur. This empiric approach has proven very effective in reducing the frequency and severity of future reactions. For reasons that are not clear, the vast majority of patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis gradually improve. Episodes decline in frequency and remissions occur in many instances [6].Our patient is retrospectively classified as IA-F type. He had several attacks which vary in intensity approximately twice monthly. He was receiving antihistaminic for several months. After termination of antihistaminic, symptoms worsen. Despite lack of specific treatment with prednisone his attacks decline in frequency.Treatment of Kounis syndrome is challenging because it needs to address both cardiac and allergic symptoms simultaneously and the drugs administered may worsen the allergy and aggravate heart function. In patients with type I variant, treatment of the allergic event alone may abolish symptoms. The use of hydrocortisone and H1 and H2 antihistamines is adequate. The administration of vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers may abolish hypersensitivity-induced vasospasm and they may be considered as the initial anti-ischemic agent [1, 7].The potential effect of several drugs is debatable. Aspirin may aggravate an ongoing allergic reaction. Nitroglycerine may cause hypotension and tachycardia, which may further complicate allergic reactions, but seems safe if blood pressure is satisfactory. Epinephrine, which is the drug of choice and may save lives in anaphylaxis, may aggravate ischemia and worsen coronary vasospasm in Kounis syndrome. It is advised that sulphite-free epinephrine is given intramuscularly in aqueous solution when needed [8].Our patient experienced worse stenocardia after intramuscular adrenalin injection which further consolidates the diagnosis.Beta-blockers may induce more vasospasm due to unopposed α-adrenergic effect and may offset some of the beneficial effects of epinephrine. Opioids such as morphine, codeine, and meperidine given to relieve acute chest pain should be administered with extreme caution in patients with Kounis syndrome because they may induce massive mast-cell degranulation and aggravate allergic reaction. Paracetamol is not recommended, especially by intravenous administration, because it might cause severe hypotension due to a reduction in cardiac output. Fentanyl and its derivatives are weak mast-cell triggers and may be considered as the drug of choice when narcotic analgesia is necessary [1, 7].Our patient represents a special challenge due to idiopathic nature of anaphylactic reactions and frequent chest pain attacks. Optimal treatment for combination of his pathologies is still debatable.Authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Ticagrelor Associated Heart Block: The Need for Close and Continued Monitoring
1Internal Medicine, Easton Hospital, Easton, PA,  USA2Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA,  USA3Easton Hospital, PA,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Munish Sharma; moc.liamg@demtnihsinumReceived 4 December 2016; Accepted 10 January 2017; Published 26 January 2017Academic Editor: Antonio de Padua MansurCopyright © 2017 Munish Sharma  and Daniel A. N. Mascarenhas. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Ticagrelor is an antiplatelet agent prescribed to prevent the development of adverse cardiac events after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). According to the PLATO trial, ticagrelor is associated with ventricular pauses in the first week of treatment; however, these episodes were felt to be asymptomatic and nonfatal to the patient. We present a case of ticagrelor related second-degree type II heart block causing severe dizziness and diaphoresis that resolved after discontinuation of the medication.It is mandatory to start a patient with ACS with or without ST-segment elevation on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitor [1]. Amongst the P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitors, the use of clopidogrel is hampered by the slow and variable transformation of the prodrug to the active metabolite, modest and variable platelet inhibition, an increased risk of bleeding, and an increased risk of stent thrombosis [2]. Prasugrel, a thienopyridine prodrug, has good inhibitory effect on platelets and has lower risk of myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis, but it is associated with a higher risk of major bleeding in patients [2]. Ticagrelor, a reversible and direct-acting oral antagonist of the adenosine diphosphate receptor P2Y12, was found to provide faster and more efficacious P2Y12 inhibition than clopidogrel with no increased bleeding risk [3]. According to the PLATO trial, which established superiority of ticagrelor over clopidogrel in preventing major cardiovascular adverse events, there was increased incidence of ventricular pause and dyspnea with ticagrelor in the first week of treatment compared to those receiving clopidogrel (5.8% versus 3.6%, resp.; ). But such episodes were concluded to be infrequent or the same as clopidogrel at 30 days (2.1% versus 1.7%, resp., for ticagrelor and clopidogrel; ) and were rarely associated with symptoms [4]. We present a case of second-degree type II heart block due to ticagrelor which was diagnosed 6 months after initial percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of left circumflex artery done for unstable angina. This case report will also add to the existing literature about incidences of symptomatic atrioventricular block (AV block) that can occur with ticagrelor.In May of 2016, a 55-year-old male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status after angioplasty of left anterior descending (LAD) artery 2 years ago presented to the emergency room (ER) with substernal chest pain. His cardiac enzymes were not elevated and electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 62 bpm with borderline AV conduction delay and right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern (Figure 1). The patient was only taking aspirin and had discontinued his statin due to muscle ache and metoprolol because of fatigue. His chest pain was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin in the ER. In view of his significant history of CAD and typical anginal symptoms, patient underwent cardiac catheterization. It revealed 90 percent stenosis of the left mid circumflex coronary artery which was successfully stented with a drug-eluting stent. Right coronary artery (RCA) showed 50–60% stenosis while LAD showed patent stent. The patient recovered very well. After calculating the GRACE score, the patient was discharged on aspirin and ticagrelor as per the ACC guidelines. He was also prescribed rosuvastatin and metoprolol. Two months after PCI, the patient presented to his primary cardiologist due to worsening fatigue and intermittent dizziness. His metoprolol was stopped. In November, 2016, he was brought by emergency squad to the hospital due to worsening dizziness and diaphoresis at rest. He denied any h/o chest pain, palpitations, nausea, or loss of consciousness. The patient had stopped ticagrelor 1 day prior to this admission since he ran out of it. The patient requested a second opinion on this admission. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 126/66 mmHg and heart rate was regular at 42 beats per minute. The neck was supple with no carotid bruits and cardiac auscultation revealed 2/6 ejection systolic murmur in the left sternal border. Patient’s EKG revealed second-degree type II atrioventricular (AV) block which was new (Figure 2). His cardiac enzymes, thyroid stimulating hormone, serum potassium, and magnesium were within normal range. The patient did not receive ticagrelor further during the admission. Cardiac catheterization revealed RCA stenosis of 60–70% but no intervention was required as this was not the cause of the new onset heart block. We considered starting patient on oral theophylline on admission had the heart block not resolved within 24 hours. His second-degree heart block resolved 2 days after discontinuation of ticagrelor and his EKG showed sinus bradycardia (heart rate = 54 bpm) with borderline AV conduction delay with RBBB pattern (Figure 3) which was similar to his baseline EKG. Clopidogrel was started as an alternative P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitor and aspirin was continued. He was discharged after an event monitor was placed.According to the PLATO trial, ventricular pauses associated with ticagrelor are believed to be of no clinical significance. But recent noticeable surge in case reports about severe symptomatic bradycardia with high grade AV block necessitates need for a well-structured larger study to investigate this potentially life threatening adverse effect of ticagrelor. A case control study conducted in 140 cases and 560 controls identified during the period of April 2012 to March 2014 found no significant association between bradycardia and exposure to ticagrelor relative to clopidogrel in the previous 90 days prior to the index date [5]. But more data exuding from larger studies would be useful to strengthen such findings.The mechanism of bradyarrhythmia due to ticagrelor is not well established. Ticagrelor inhibits cellular uptake of adenosine and thus increases its plasma concentration which can cause AV blocking effect. It is also thought to affect the cardiac automaticity and conduction [6, 7]. Prior case reports have emphasized the tendency of developing high grade AV blocks with ticagrelor in patients with preexisting conduction defect and in those on medications with AV nodal blocking properties. Ticagrelor is already under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scanner for a potential serious AV block as reported in the FAERS database, October 4th, 2016. Our patient also had a first-degree AV block at baseline and was on metoprolol which was discontinued in spite of which he developed Mobitz type II block 6 months after PCI which was completely new. His clinical and electrocardiogram findings improved only after discontinuation of ticagrelor.There is contradictory view about the need to place permanent pacemaker in patients with high grade AV block due to ticagrelor. Some authors have reported that they needed to implant permanent dual chamber pacemaker in their patient 10 days after discontinuation of ticagrelor since the patient was symptomatic [8]. While others have reported that second-degree AV block returned to first degree on merely discontinuing ticagrelor. Routine use of temporary or permanent pacemaker is not indicated unless patient is symptomatic [9]. In our case, we discontinued the ticagrelor and patient showed significant improvement in his symptoms. Insertion of temporary or permanent pacemaker was not required.Extreme caution and close monitoring for development of heart block are needed after initiation of ticagrelor, especially in patients with preexisting conduction defect or on AV nodal blocking agent. Beta blockers may not be the only reason for such cases of symptomatic bradycardia or high grade AV block. Ticagrelor should be considered as the possible offending agent. Other P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitors such as clopidogrel or prasugrel are suitable alternatives if the patient is at risk for development of a potentially life threatening heart block.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Saddle Pulmonary Embolism with Thrombus in Transit across a Patent Foramen Ovale
1Harlem Hospital Center, New York City, NY,  USA2Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, NY,  USA3Department of Cardiology, Harlem Hospital Center, New York City, NY,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to Fitzgerald Shepherd; moc.liamg@78pehsfReceived 25 September 2016; Revised 28 December 2016; Accepted 10 January 2017; Published 26 January 2017Academic Editor: Filippo M. SarulloCopyright © 2017 Fitzgerald Shepherd et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.This is the case of a 25-year-old obese man who presented with acute shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations. Of note, he lives a sedentary lifestyle and was recently hospitalized for incision and drainage of a left foot abscess. On presentation he was tachypnoeic, tachycardiac, and hypoxic but blood pressure was stable. Laboratory studies were significant for elevated D-dimer and mildly increased troponin. On further investigation he was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism with massive clot burden. Echocardiogram revealed thrombus in transit and McConnell’s sign. He underwent surgical embolectomy and closure of a patent foramen ovale. This is a particularly rare case, especially in such a young patient. Because this is a rare diagnosis, with insufficient data, there is no formally established treatment guideline. However, in patients who are good surgical candidates, studies have shown better outcome with surgical embolectomy as compared to anticoagulation alone or thrombolysis. Risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is described succinctly by Virchow’s triad: stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulable state. The embolization of a DVT into the right heart predisposes to pulmonary embolism (PE). In the case of an embolic event, a patent foramen ovale (remnant of the fetal circulation) puts the patient at risk for paradoxical embolism.We report a case of an obese 25-year-old man, recently diagnosed diabetic, who presented to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath for several hours. Of note, he presented two weeks prior for left foot pain and was found to have an abscess on the plantar surface. He denied foot trauma, insect, or animal bites at that time. The abscess was successfully incised and drained, and he was admitted for intravenous antibiotics. During that admission he received subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and he was discharged five days later on culture-directed oral antibiotics. Since that time, he had been mostly sedentary but this was not a great departure from his typical habits.The patient was at his usual state of health until the morning of presentation (while playing video games at home) when he had acute onset shortness of breath with associated palpitations and sharp left-sided chest pain. He had no fever, leg swelling, or calf pain. He denied smoking or illicit drug use. His symptoms continued and he was brought to the emergency department of his community hospital later that evening.On physical examination, he was lying in bed slightly tachypnoeic at 20 breaths per minute but speaking in full sentences. He was tachycardiac at 135 beats per minute and afebrile at 97.1 degrees Fahrenheit and blood pressure was 144/96 mmHg. On cardiac examination, he had normal heart sounds with regular rhythm and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Breath sounds were vesicular on respiratory exam and no wheezes or crackles were appreciated. Extremities were without edema and the left foot wound was well healed.Laboratory results (Table 1) showed significantly elevated D-dimer and electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern (Figure 1). Given the suspicion for pulmonary embolism, he was presumptively started on low molecular weight heparin and computed tomography pulmonary angiogram was ordered (Figure 2). The radiologist urgently called in the early morning to give a preliminary report of an extensive saddle pulmonary embolism. Our patient’s blood pressure remained stable however. The intensive care team was consulted, accepted the patient to the unit, and then arranged for transfer to a tertiary care cardiothoracic center for possible surgical intervention. Echocardiogram (Figures 3 and 4 and Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/6752709) that morning remarkably displayed whirling echogenic mass in the atria and McConnell’s sign.He arrived at the tertiary care hospital around noon and was urgently taken to the operating theater where he underwent median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and clamping of the aorta (which also helped to prevent systemic embolization). When the incision was made for cannulation of the inferior vena cava, a large amount of clot extruded through the incision site. The patient had right atriotomy and pulmonary endarterectomy with extraction of a large amount of thrombotic material that obstructed the pulmonary arteries (Figures 5 and 6). The PFO was sutured close in two layers. The surgery was performed without complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well.The patient was also evaluated by the Hematology team for hypercoagulable state and thrombophilic screen was sent off. This included Factor V Leiden, protein C, protein S, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, prothrombin gene mutation, and beta-2 glycoprotein. All of these have returned negative.Our patient endorsed a relatively sedentary lifestyle at baseline, with recent hospitalization and increased immobilization after incision and drainage of the MRSA left foot abscess likely contributing to a greater risk of thrombogenesis. There have been other cases described in the literature of lower limb infection leading to DVT/PE, some of which also involved MRSA [1, 2]. A lower limb Doppler was not done in this case; however, in retrospect a left lower extremity DVT was the likely origin of the clot. Given the extent of thrombosis in this otherwise well young man, it is also reasonable to assume that there is some underlying thrombophilia, but thrombophilic workup has so far been unremarkable.The visualization of a right atrial thrombus is referred to as a thrombus in transit and is a very rare echocardiographic finding, carrying a high mortality rate of up to 29% [3, 4]. It is even more rare to visualize a thrombus across PFO [5, 6]. This is particularly unique in such young patient as the average age for similar presentation is 58 ± 16 years (our patient is 25 years old). Death due to cardiogenic shock and/or right heart failure has been noted in 44% of patients who presented with an embolus straddling the PFO and death due to stroke in nearly 16% [7].Our patient presented with acute shortness of breath and was discovered to have saddle PE with massive clot burden and thrombus-in-transit straddling PFO: a dangerous diagnosis. Although the rarity of this diagnosis results in a paucity of standardized treatment guidelines, studies have shown improved survival with surgical embolectomy as compared to anticoagulation alone in patients who are hemodynamically stable with low to moderate surgical risk [8, 9]. Thrombolysis, while used for patients in higher risk groups, may be associated with higher rates of mortality [10, 11]. In accordance with these studies and suggested treatment algorithm our patient underwent urgent embolectomy and PFO closure and was started on anticoagulation postoperatively. He suffered no neurological event and did well with aggressive surgical management.The authors have no conflict of interests to declare.Images of clot (Figures 4 and 5) are courtesy of David Yaffee, M.D.
ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction and Normal Coronary Arteries after Consuming Energy Drinks
1Division of Cardiology, Mayo Clinic Health System-Franciscan Healthcare, La Crosse, WI,  USA2Division of Cardiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,  USACorrespondence should be addressed to S. Michael Gharacholou; ude.oyam@rayhahs.uolohcarahgReceived 21 November 2016; Accepted 21 December 2016; Published 19 January 2017Academic Editor: Antonio de Padua MansurCopyright © 2017 S. Michael Gharacholou et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The use of energy drinks, which often contain stimulants, is common among young persons, yet there have been few reports of adverse cardiac events. We report the case of a 27-year-old man who was admitted to our facility with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the setting of using energy drinks. Angiography revealed no obstructive coronary disease. The patient had elevation of cardiac troponin. Noninvasive testing with echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated both abnormalities in resting wall motion at the anterior apex along with late gadolinium enhancement of the anterior wall, respectively. The patient also underwent formal invasive evaluation with an intracoronary Doppler study demonstrating normal coronary flow reserve and acetylcholine provocation that excluded endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease. The patient recovered and has abstained from consuming additional energy drinks with no reoccurrence of symptoms. A review of some of the potential cardiac risks associated with consuming energy drinks is presented.A 27-year-old man with no previous medical history presented to the emergency department with 1 hour of acute onset of left-sided chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. He reported active tobacco smoking but denied other drug use. He used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for back pain. There was a family history of coronary artery disease in an uncle who underwent coronary revascularization. He had also recently been using energy drinks (Rockstar, Rockstar, Inc., Las Vegas, NV), sometimes 4-5 beverages in a 12-hour period, in order to stay awake during his evening work shift in a warehouse. He denied any previous episodes of chest pain, exertional symptoms, previous thromboembolic disease, nausea or vomiting, or syncope. On examination, his blood pressure was elevated at 155/100, pulse was 74 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen. His cardiac examination was normal, including a normal first and second heart sound and no appreciable murmur or pericardial friction rub. His laboratory values were notable for hemoglobin of 15.4 g/dL, white blood cell count of 5.8, platelet count 254,000, normal blood chemistry, and an elevated troponin T of 0.41 (normal reference range < 0.01 ng/mL) and CK-MB of 123.4 (normal reference range < 7.8 ng/mL). His electrocardiogram demonstrated ST-segment elevations in leads V2–V6, I, and aVL along with reciprocal changes in leads III and aVF, concerning for an acute anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (Figure 1(a)). He was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin, unfractionated heparin, and aspirin in the emergency department which improved but did not completely alleviate his symptoms and brought urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography was performed from a radial approach and symptom relief was documented after intra-arterial injection of a radial antispasmodic cocktail (i.e., 200 mcg nitroglycerin, 2.5 mg verapamil, and 5,000 units of heparin). Coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries with TIMI III flow without any angiographic evidence of stenosis, dissection, embolism, or plaque rupture (Figure 2). A repeat electrocardiogram after his coronary angiogram demonstrated normalization of his ST-segment abnormalities (Figure 1(b)). An echocardiogram was performed and demonstrated significant akinesis of the left ventricular apex (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)), findings that were confirmed with abnormal longitudinal strain in the apical segments (Figure 4). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) also documented akinesis in the left ventricular apex, similar to the wall motion abnormalities present on echocardiography. In addition, cMRI confirmed areas of abnormal delayed gadolinium enhancement in both a patchy and full-thickness configuration along the mid and distal anterior wall and the mid septum (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). A formal toxicology examination was not requested given that the patient rapidly recovered after his initial presentation. The absence of the toxicology leaves the question as to whether other potential substances could have been associated with the acute cardiac presentation. A urine drug screen at the time of admission was negative for cocaine, amphetamines, and barbiturates. The patient was treated with long acting nitrates and calcium channel blocker, though he continued to have occasional episodes of chest discomfort. Given the concern of recurrent spasm and given that the presumed etiology of his ST-elevation myocardial infarction was coronary vasospasm, he was referred for repeat coronary angiography, including a functional protocol to test the response of the coronary endothelium and the coronary microcirculation. His coronary angiogram was normal, with no evidence of atherosclerosis or vasospasm. Intracoronary adenosine was administered at a dose of 60 mcg and coronary flow reserve (CFR) was normal at 3.0 using intracoronary Doppler study in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. These findings suggested normal microcirculatory function. Subsequently, increasing concentrations of intracoronary acetylcholine were administered with no significant change in the Doppler-derived average peak velocity, CFR, symptoms, angiographic appearance of the LAD, or electrocardiographic parameters, all consistent with normal endothelial function. Based on these results, he was not felt to have any functional coronary or endothelial abnormalities. He was advised to abstain from any further use of energy drinks.We report a case of anterior STEMI in the absence of coronary obstruction presumably due to severe coronary vasospasm and temporally related to drinking commercially available caffeinated energy drinks. To our knowledge, our report represents the second report in the literature of energy drinks precipitating an episode of STEMI that also underwent invasive angiography with no evidence for coronary obstruction [1] and the only report that evaluated the pattern of myocardial abnormality of energy drink-induced STEMI using noninvasive imaging modalities of 2-dimensional echocardiography, longitudinal strain, and cMRI.Up to 30% of women and 12% of men have myocardial infarction but no evidence of obstructive (≥50%) coronary disease at the time of angiography [2, 3]. From a mechanistic standpoint, these cases have been attributed to plaque disruption that cannot be reliably detected by invasive angiography, endothelial and microvascular dysfunction, or vasospasm [4]. In one study of patients with myocardial infarction and nonobstructive CAD, nearly 60% had abnormal cMRI findings in a transmural or subendocardial pattern (i.e., ischemic) [3]. Interestingly, the remaining 40% had subepicardial or midwall (i.e., nonischemic) or mixed (both ischemic and nonischemic) patterns of late gadolinium enhancement on cMRI [3]. The proposed mechanism for this might be related to focal ischemia in an area of vasospasm or plaque erosion, resulting in platelet aggregates and distal embolization [3]. This ischemic insult can be appreciated with T2 hyperintensity on cMRI, as myocardial edema is often a consequence of myocardial ischemia. Coronary vasospasm has been implicated as a cause of myocardial infarction when no obstructive CAD is identified at the time of coronary angiography, and certain clinical presentations, such as cocaine and stimulant use, are risk factors for development of coronary vasospasm. Tobacco use has been implicated in coronary spasm, likely mediated through nicotine, which can be a potent vasoconstrictor.Energy drinks were introduced in the US in 1997, approximately 10 years after first being released in Europe. Their popularity among young adults has steadily increased and it is estimated that about 1 out of 20 young men consume a daily energy drink, with sales of energy drinks in the US exceeding $9 billion [5]. Because many of these products contain herbal or “natural” ingredients, they avoid federal regulation that is required of medications, despite the increasing concern regarding adverse health effect and unexpected deaths among users of energy drinks. The Food and Drug Administration has previously declared energy drinks containing both caffeine and alcohol as being unsafe. No restrictions apply to how energy beverage companies advertise “energy” or “performance” effects of their product [6]. Finally, the caffeine content in energy beverages are often not reported and, when reported, may vary widely. Caffeine absorbs quickly after ingestion and its liver metabolites theophylline and theobromine are active stimulants. Caffeine overdoses, some fatal, have been reported and purportedly attributed to cardiac arrhythmia [7]. Energy drinks are increasingly becoming a public health problem as more individuals are seeking stamina and alertness, yet the safety of these beverages and potential drug-drug interactions that may occur have not been well described.Svatikova et al. performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 25 healthy volunteers who consumed 16 oz of a commercially available energy drink or placebo (matched in taste and color but without caffeine or stimulants) and studied effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and serum norepinephrine levels [8]. Despite no differences in heart rate between energy drink use and placebo, there was a significant increase in systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure with energy drink use as compared to placebo. This was associated with a significant increase in norepinephrine levels after energy drink (149.8 pg/mL to 249.8 pg/mL) as compared to placebo (139.9 pg/mL to 178.6 pg/mL) (). These findings suggest that adrenergic stimulation with energy drinks may predispose patients to cardiovascular risk and may be particularly concerning in patients with unrecognized cardiac disorders or cardiac-related susceptibilities. A recent systematic review of published cases of adverse cardiovascular events after consuming energy drinks identified only 4 cases of STEMI, which occurred in men between the ages of 17 and 24 [9]. Two of the cases never underwent coronary angiography. Of the 2 cases that underwent cardiac catheterization, 1 patient had intracoronary thrombosis of the left main coronary artery and required emergency surgical coronary bypass [10]. The other case had no obstructive coronary disease, which was similar to ours; however, that patient had a normal echocardiogram with no wall motion abnormalities [1].Our case adds to the current literature on STEMI precipitated by energy drink consumption in a patient with angiographically normal coronary arteries, representing the second such case reported. In addition, unique aspects of this report include cardiac structural findings documenting regional wall motion abnormalities by 2-dimensional echocardiography, longitudinal strain, and cMRI. Tissue characterization by cMRI demonstrated abnormal late gadolinum enhancement in the myocardial territory supplied by the left anterior descending artery, a pattern that previously has been reported in patients suffering acute myocardial infarction but without obstructive coronary disease. Longitudinal strain and cMRI findings of energy drink-induced STEMI have not previously been reported. Given that the patient reported a smoking history, tobacco use represents a potential confounder regarding his clinical presentation with STEMI. Although there were no angiographic findings to suggest the presence of atherosclerosis, as would often be seen in chronic smokers, nicotine products have been implicated in cases of vasospasm. Clinicians should be aware of the potential cardiovascular adverse events of energy drinks in young persons who present with acute cardiovascular issues, particularly given the growing use of these energy beverages in both US and world markets.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Ventricular Tachycardia Originating from Moderator Band: New Perspective on Catheter Ablation

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 59-year-old woman was referred to the institution with burdens of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (IVT). Electroanatomic mapping revealed a complex fractionated, high frequency potential with long duration preceding the QRS onset of the IVT. The real end point of ablation was the disappearance of the conduction block of Purkinje potential during the sinus rhythm besides the disappearance of the inducible tachycardia. Location of distal catheter was at the moderator band (MB) by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Only irrigated radiofrequency current was delivered at both insertions of the MB which can completely eliminate the IVT.Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (IVT) usually emerges in the patients without structural heart disease or electrical abnormalities. Triggers for premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and IVT are mostly located at the right and left ventricular outflow tract, the His-Purkinje fibers system, and atrioventricular valves. Some regions such as papillary muscles and anterior wall of the right ventricle also account for the triggers of PVCs and IVT. Although previous studies had proved the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation for most IVT, a small series of IVT arising from uncommon regions are difficult to be ablated and also are underestimated. Anter et al. [1] reported the first case of VF originating from the moderator band (MB), a structure that never was thought to have a correlation with arrhythmia before. Sadek et al. [2] then summarized a small series of IVT arising from the MB. Both of these studies described different targets for ablation that needs further discussion. Here we report an IVT originating from the MB undergoing catheter ablation with a precise target.A 59-year-old, previously healthy woman was referred to the institution for repeated palpitations for six years. Within the last twelve days, the symptoms became severe, even with once presentation of syncope at home. A Holter ECG from the local hospital showed 29854 events of ventricular arrhythmia (17% of the total heart beats), including 3444 episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, 754 ventricular couplets, and 1654 single premature ventricular ectopics. Initial therapy with oral antiarrhythmia drugs (amiodarone and propafenone) was unsuccessful.Initial workup included baseline ECG, normal blood test, chest X-ray examination, echocardiogram, and coronary angiography. The frequent unifocal initiating IVT had a unique morphology characterized by a left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern with very late precordial transition and a left superior axis (Figure 1).After providing informed consent, the patient underwent electrophysiologic study and ablation while antiarrhythmic medications had been held for 2 half-lives. Endocardial mapping of the right ventricle (RV) was performed by using a 3.5 mm open irrigated-tip catheter (Navistar Thermocool, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) and CARTO mapping system (Carto, Biosense Webster). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was applied to define the anatomy, facilitate mapping, and assess contact during ablation. A CARTO electroanatomic mapping system (Biosense Webster) was used. Spontaneous PVCs/IVT were identified and mapped when present by activation mapping. A complex fractionated, high frequency potential with long duration of 57 milliseconds, preceding the QRS onset of the arrhythmogenic VT by 23 milliseconds, was mapped at the site of the earliest myocardial activation (Figure 2(b)). This potential was systematically mapped from the middle RV at the lower septum, along the papillary muscle to the insertion at the RV apex and the extension to the interventricular septum (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)) via the MB. Pacing mapping showed that the morphology of pacing QRS complex is identical to the QRS complex of clinical VT (Figure 2(a)). The anatomical site of the earliest activation and the location of distal catheter were at the MB as visualized by TTE (Figure 3(c)).Radiofrequency ablation (RFCA) current was delivered at 30 W of power-controlled mode with a temperature of 43°C and a normal saline velocity of 17 milliliters per hour. RFCA was delivered at the free-wall insertion along the MB which can successfully terminate the VT, with a conduction block of Purkinje potential observed during the sinus rhythm (Figure 2(c)). No ventricular arrhythmia can be induced during program stimulation and isoproterenol infusion (10 μg/min). The patient had no further episodes of IVT but few asymptomatic PVCs over the ensuing 120 days until her discharge home without antiarrhythmic drugs. Three months later, the patient was hospitalized again because of recurrent symptomatic tachycardia. Surface ECG showed the morphology of the recurrent IVT had no change with the original one. The patient underwent a second ablation, which employed a similar mapping system and the ablation energy to the first procedure. TTE was also applied for the procedure to visualize and guide the catheter for the contact of MB. Different from the first procedure, RFCA was delivered at the septum insertion along the MB with an end point of the disappearance of the conduction block of Purkinje potential during the sinus rhythm besides the disappearance of the inducible tachycardia. The patient had no further episodes of IVT over the ensuing 15 months until her discharge home without antiarrhythmic drugs.MB is part of the septomarginal trabeculation, supporting the anterior papillary muscle of the tricuspid valve, and connects the anterior papillary muscle to the free wall of the ventricle. It was thought to be a structure protecting against overdistention of the RV, hence the name “moderator” [3]. The role of the MB as part of the conduction system of the heart involves the right atrioventricular bundle, as conduction tissue fibers move toward the apex of the ventricle before entering the anterior papillary muscle [4]. The morphology and the topology of the MB had significant diversity [5]. The possibility of relationship between the abnormity of the morphology and the topology of MB and ventricular arrhythmia need further research.For the histological examinations of MB, clumps of conductive cells and large amounts of muscle fibers were identified. Conductive tissue was represented by clumps of Purkinje cells, surrounded by myocardial fibers [6]. The rich autonomic innervations of the MB may contribute to its mechanism of arrhythmogenicity. In our report, a conduction block of Purkinje potential was observed after temporary terminating the IVT.Information about the prevalence, ECG features, and results of ablation of MB PVCs is limited. An article from Anter et al. reported a case of a 59-year-old man with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) storm. As visualized by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), radiofrequency ablation at the MB, recording the earliest Purkinje potential separated from the local electrogram, was successful [1]. The author believed that the trigger was originated from the RV Purkinje network because ablation at the earliest Purkinje potential was successful. We partly agree with this view. We also recorded a Purkinje potential during ablation, of which conduction block was observed after temporary terminating the IVT. But the ablation of Purkinje potential target only was insufficient for terminating VT. The complex fractionated, high frequency potentials with long duration preceding the QRS onset of the arrhythmogenic VT were exactly our ablation targets, which suggest that the mechanism of microreentry among the Purkinje system and the connected myocardia is reasonable. Sadek et al. [2] summarized an MB source of PVCs in 10 patients presenting with VAs that were mapped to the MB, 7 of whom presented with PVC-induced VF. VAs originating from the MB have LBBB morphology with a left superior frontal plane axis, a sharp downstroke of the QRS in the precordial leads, and a relatively narrow QRS width. Not only does MB ventricular arrhythmia have a late precordial transition pattern, typically after V4, but also the transition is always later than that of the sinus QRS. The QRS morphology occasionally changed during ablation, suggesting a change in the exit site. The site of successful ablation location along the MB was variable, including the septum insertion, the body of the MB, and the free-wall insertion. 60% of patients with MB originating PVCs required a second ablation procedure days to months after the initial procedure. According to our experiences of two procedures of ablation, both of the septum insertion and the free-wall insertion of MB should be ablated together in order to completely eliminate the IVT. The real end point of ablation was the disappearance of the conduction block of Purkinje potential during the sinus rhythm besides the disappearance of the inducible tachycardia. A reasonable explanation for these perspectives is that MB originating IVT has two exits including the septum insertion and the free-wall insertion of MB. Ablation of only one insertion would lead to a conduction block of Purkinje potential and a temporary termination of IVT. Ablation of both insertions of MB is necessary to completely eliminate the IVT with a disappearance of the conduction block of Purkinje potential.The contact and the stability of catheter are vital to the successful ablation. ICE is the most effective way of visualization for the MB during ablation, which is widely used for ablation on the papillary muscles. In our report, we successfully used the TTE to visualize and guide the catheter for the contact and the stability during ablation, which is of high cost efficiency for the patient. We found the MB and the catheter can be monitored dynamically during ablation, which is of importance for the ablation of MB not only on the septum insertion but also on the free-wall insertion. Cryoablation and contact force technology may be quite useful for achieving greater success when ablating on the MB [2].Medical therapy for MB originating IVT is limited. Lidocaine [1], sedation [1], propafenone, and amiodarone are unsuccessful for MB originating IVT before catheter ablation. Quinidine [2] and propafenone seem to be effective on MB originating PVCs after catheter ablation without VT and VF. Because VF is commonly detected or induced as previously reported, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy for secondary prevention or even primary prevention before and after unsuccessful catheter ablation is lacking feasibility report. A large sample research is needed in the future. The prognosis of MB originating IVT without any therapy is uncertain. But we do suggest that the interventional therapy should be positively applied to prevent the malignant arrhythmia including cardiac arrest. And, although catheter ablation seems to be effective in eliminating the IVT, ICD first or catheter ablation first is still a question.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Drs.

Cardiac Calcified Amorphous Tumor of the Mitral Valve Presenting as Transient Ischemic Attack

They have been reported in the literature in only a few cases. Thus, the incidence, pathogenesis, and best approach to the treatment are not certain. We report a case of CATs on the atrial surface of the anterior mitral valve leaflet in a 37-year-old female who was diagnosed by histopathological examination after surgical removal.Calcified amorphous tumors (CATs) of the heart are an exceedingly rare nonneoplastic intracardiac mass that was originally described in 1997 by Reynolds et al. [1]. The clinical features of cardiac CAT are usually like the other cardiac masses which include the symptoms related to obstruction or embolization such as dyspnea and syncope. Thus, it may be misdiagnosed with other cardiac tumors [2, 3]. Accurate diagnosis of a cardiac mass is often made on surgical excision and histopathological examination [1–3]. Currently, only a few cases of cardiac CATs have been reported in the literature. The incidence, pathogenesis, and best approach to the treatment are not certain. Herein, we describe a case of cardiac CATs originating from the mitral valve in a 37-year-old woman revealed by the transient ischemic attack (TIA).A 37-year-old woman sought neurological assistance after an episode of TIA manifesting predominantly as left hemiparesis of 5-minute duration. At that time, she had no abnormalities on examination of the cranial nerves, and brain computed tomography (CT) scan findings were normal. She was referred to a cardiologist to be evaluated for TIA. The physical examination and routine blood laboratory investigations results were normal. Her past medical history showed hypertension (HTN) and hyperlipidemia (HLP) which both were under control. During further clinical assessments, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed, which revealed an echogenic, round, and mobile mass measuring 5 × 5 mm in diameter attached by a short pedicle on the atrial surface of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (Figure 1). There was mild to moderate regurgitation of the mitral valve. The other valves and cardiac structures were normal. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 60%. The patient was given anticoagulant therapy and referred for surgery with clinical suspicion of a papillary fibroblastoma or other primary cardiac tumors. At operation, after a median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass via aortobicaval cannulation was established. An incision was made in the left atrium, and a soft, firm, and friable mass was founded on the atrial surface of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve which was easily removed (Figure 2). The anterior leaflet was repaired with an autologous pericardium patch. The patient was warmed and weaned from cardiopulmonary without difficulty.Histopathological evaluation of the resected tumor showed a dense calcification (shredded due to no decalcification) in a background of amorphous degenerating fibrinous material (Figure 3) and according to the clinical and histological features, a diagnosis of cardiac CAT was provided. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from the hospital 4 days after the surgery without any complications.Intracardiac masses have been classified as neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions. Cardiac tumors are also divided into benign (about 75%) and malignant neoplasms in which more than half of the benign tumors are myxomas [4]. Cardiac CAT which recently is described as a distinct pathological entity is extremely rare cardiac benign nonneoplasm [1]. The clinical manifestations of CAT are not specific and similar to those of other cardiac masses, often related to embolization or flow obstruction of the calcified fragments. Thus, differentiation between various types of cardiac masses, such as myxomas or fibroma, calcified thrombi, emboli, vegetation, and other intracardiac tumors may be difficult. The most common symptoms of these masses are progressive dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, and symptoms related to embolism [2, 3, 5]. Rarely, they may also present with cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia [3]. Further, mobile CATs have a higher chance of embolic event than immobile lesions. Even though modern cardiac imaging modalities can help to narrow down the differential diagnosis, surgical excision of the lesion and histological examination are necessary for definitive diagnosis [6]. Histological features of cardiac CATs consist of nodular calcium deposits within a background of fibrin or amorphous fibrillar material. Although they may occur in any chamber of the heart, they are found most commonly in the left ventricle (31.25%) and mitral valve (25%). Approximately 12.5% of cases of the cardiac CATs originated from the right atrium [7]. In our case, cardiac CATs were mobile and found in the mitral valve with initial presentation of TIA. The average age at diagnosis is 51 years with a range from 18 to 78 years. Prevalence is slightly more frequently in females [7]. The patient in our report was a 37-year-old woman. Although the exact pathogenesis of cardiac CAT is not determined, some authors believe the hypothesis that cardiac CAT is an organized and calcified mural thrombus [8]. Kawata et al. also suggested that disorders of calcium-phosphorus metabolism in patients with renal dysfunction can be potential causes of CAT [9]. On the other hand, the lack of such predisposing conditions in other cases, like the current case, proposes that thrombosis may not be the only pathogenetic mechanism and also other various mechanisms can be involved. Surgical excision is mandatory because of the risk of complications or embolization and also for accurate diagnosis. Recurrence and fatal outcomes of cardiac CATs have rarely been reported after surgical resection, and, consequently, long-term follow-up with cardiac imaging studies, especially in patients with incomplete resection, is required [6, 10]. In our case, the initial diagnosis was thought to be fibroblastoma or other primary cardiac tumors, but after resection of the tumor and histopathological evaluation, the diagnosis of CATs was confirmed. To summarize, we reported a case of CATs on the atrial surface of the anterior mitral valve leaflet in a 37-year-old female which was confirmed by histopathological examination after surgical removal.The CATs of the heart are extremely rare nonneoplastic intracardiac mass and accurate diagnosis of a cardiac mass is often made on surgical excision and histological examination for the best management of them.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Coronary-Cameral Fistula Connecting the Left Anterior Descending Artery and the First Obtuse Marginal Artery to the Left Ventricle: A Rare Finding

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Coronary-cameral fistulas are rare congenital malformations, often incidentally found during cardiac catheterizations. The majority of these fistulas are congenital in nature but can be acquired secondary to trauma or invasive cardiac procedures. These fistulas most commonly originate in the right coronary artery and terminate into the right ventricle and least frequently drain into the left ventricle. Depending upon their size and location, coronary-cameral fistulas can lead to congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and bacterial endocarditis. We describe a case of 49-year-old woman who presented with worsening exertional dyspnea and leg swelling. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 35%. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a fistula connecting the left anterior descending artery and the first obtuse marginal artery to the left ventricle. In this report, the authors provide a concise review on coronary fistulas, complications, and management options.Coronary artery anomalies occur in less than one percent of the general population [1]. Coronary-cameral fistulas are the abnormal vascular connections between coronary arteries and cardiac chambers. These fistulas are rare clinical entities that either usually result from congenital abnormalities or are acquired from trauma or invasive cardiac procedures. However, the clinical significance depends upon the location and the size of the fistula. Small fistulas are usually silent and are discovered incidentally on angiography [2], while large fistulas are diagnosed secondary to the complications. The most frequent site for the fistulas is between the right coronary artery and right ventricle. Here we describe a case of a woman, who was diagnosed with a rare variant fistula connecting the distal left anterior descending artery and first obtuse marginal artery to the left ventricle.A 49-year-old African-American woman with past medical history significant for dyslipidemia, untreated hypertension, microcytic anemia, and chronic tobacco use presented to the emergency department with worsening exertional dyspnea, 3-pillow orthopnea, and leg swelling for 3-4 months prior to presentation. Her physical exam revealed grade I/VI nonradiating systolic murmur in the fourth intercostal space and 1 + pedal edema bilaterally. A complete transthoracic echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 percent, moderate global hypokinesis, and mild tricuspid regurgitation. After intravenous diuresis, the patient had left heart catheterization for evaluation of her new onset systolic heart failure and was found to have a fistula connecting distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) and first obtuse marginal artery (OM1) to the left ventricular cavity (Figures 1 and 2, Movie S1 in Supplementary Material available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/8071281). Coronary arteries were angiographically normal. The patient was started on metoprolol succinate, lisinopril, and oral diuretics for nonischemic cardiomyopathy and was subsequently discharged home.Coronary artery anomalies include anomalies of origin, termination, structure, or course. Coronary artery fistulas result from abnormalities of termination. Coronary artery fistulas are defined as sizeable connection between a coronary artery and cardiac chamber (coronary-cameral fistula) or any part of systemic or pulmonary vasculature (coronary arteriovenous fistula), having bypassed the myocardial capillary bed [3]. Congenital coronary artery fistulas are found in two out of every one thousand patients undergoing angiography, with equal predilection for males and females [4].The majority of the fistulas have a congenital origin. Congenital coronary artery fistulas may occur as an isolated finding or may be found associated with other congenital heart abnormalities, which most commonly occurs with severe right or left outflow tract obstruction, such as in pulmonary atresia with intact interventricular septum or aortic atresia with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Rarely, coronary artery fistulas can be acquired secondary to gunshot wound, stab wound, cardiac surgery, cardiac catheterization, endomyocardial biopsy, angioplasty, or pacemaker implantation.Clinical presentation depends upon the hemodynamic significance of the anomaly. Hemodynamic significance of the fistula depends upon the size of connection, the resistance of recipient chamber, and myocardial ischemia [5]. Most fistulas are small and do not cause any signs or symptoms. However, untreated hemodynamically significant fistulas result in symptoms in 19% of patients under the age of 20 and 63% of the patients over the age of 20. Larger fistulas can cause coronary artery steal resulting in ischemia of segment of myocardium perfused by coronary artery distal to fistula. Other complications include cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, bacterial endocarditis, thrombosis and/or embolism, rupture, sudden cardiac death, and premature atherosclerosis [6, 7].Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram are usually not helpful in the diagnosis of coronary-cameral fistulas. Although chest X-ray may show cardiomegaly in the presence of significant shunt flow and electrocardiogram may reveal the effects of volume overload in larger fistulas, these findings are nonspecific. Two-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiography may reveal the dilated coronary artery and on color mapping may reveal the site of drainage; however, it is difficult to delineate the detailed anatomy of the fistula. Thus, cardiac catheterization remains the modality of choice for defining the pattern of structure and flow. In this case, echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 35% and cardiac catheterization revealed the final diagnosis of the coronary-cameral fistula and its anatomy.Coronary-cameral fistulas originate from right coronary artery in 52% of the cases, the left anterior descending artery in 30% of the cases, and left circumflex artery in about 18% of the cases [8]. Over 90% of the fistulas drain in the right side of the heart with the most frequent sites of termination in the right side of the heart [9]. These fistulas rarely terminate into left ventricle or pericardium. There is a left-to-right shunt if termination is to systemic venous side and there is a left-sided volume overload if the termination is in left cardiac chambers. In our case, the patient had a fistula connecting left anterior descending artery and first obtuse marginal artery to left ventricle that was hemodynamically significant with decreased ejection fraction and causing symptoms of congestive heart failure at the age of 49.Hemodynamically insignificant fistulae, which are clinically silent and not associated with other abnormal findings, may not require further treatment. Large, hemodynamically significant fistulas should be closed by ligation. However, smaller fistulas tend to get large with the age and it is recommended to perform elective closure early in the patient who have symptoms or if they are asymptomatic but have continuous murmur or systolic murmur with an early diastolic component.Treatment options include surgical or catheter closure. Surgical methods of closure are associated with low mortality and morbidity ranging from 0 to 6%. However, surgery is not risk-free; there is a less than 5% risk of myocardial infarction after surgery and also a risk of recurrence of the fistula. Despite the good results with surgery, closure during cardiac catheterization has become the method of choice [10]. Various percutaneous catheter techniques have been employed, including Gianturco coils, interlocking detachable coils, detachable balloons, polyvinyl alcohol foam, double umbrellas, the Amplatzer duct occluder, and the Amplatzer vascular plug. Risks of fistula closure with these devices include myocardial infarction and migration of coils or discs to extracoronary vascular structures or within the coronary artery branches.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.The authors would like to show their gratitude to Dr. Sary O. Beidas, M.D., Orange Park Medical Center, for his comments on earlier version of the manuscript that greatly improved the manuscript.
Could Externalized St. Jude Medical Riata® Lead Be a Culture Medium of a Polymicrobial Endocarditis? A Clinical Case
Cardiology Unit, Cardiothoracic Department, University of Bari, Bari,  ItalyCorrespondence should be addressed to Zefferino Palamà; moc.duolci@amalap.onireffezReceived 1 October 2016; Revised 6 December 2016; Accepted 18 December 2016; Published 15 January 2017Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2017 Zefferino Palamà et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We report the case of a man affected by polymicrobial endocarditis developed on a St. Jude Medical Riata lead with a malfunction because of the outsourcing of conductors. The patient was treated with antibiotic targeted therapy and showed different bacteria at the blood cultures and then underwent transvenous leads extraction. Vegetations were highlighted on the caval, atrial, and ventricular tracts of the Riata lead, but the cultures were all negative. The externalization of Riata lead may cause the malfunction but it could also promote bacterial colonies and vegetations. In conclusion, looking for early signs of infection is mandatory during Riata leads follow-up checks. Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device (CIED) infections rates range between 0,2% and 5,8% [1]. CIED endocarditis accounts for approximately 10% of all cases of device infection [2]. St. Jude Medical Riata ICD leads show an abnormal incidence of insulation defects. The incidence of Riata externalization ranges between 2 and 4% per year. If electrical abnormalities are observed addition of a new lead is recommended; lead extraction is proposed if indicated. Complete removal of all hardware, including leads, is mandatory to ensure eradication of infection as per current guidelines [3].We report the case of an 83-years-old man admitted in the Infective Disease Department for persistent fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient was implanted in 2000 with a CRT-D system. Three years later, he presented with a pocket infection and underwent leads extraction. A new CRT-D (St. Jude Medical Atlas® HF V-341) was implanted on the contralateral right side with an atrial lead (Medtronic CapSurefix® Novus 5076) and a right ventricular single coil lead (St. Jude Medical Riata 1572), and a left ventricular lead (St. Jude Medical Quicksite® 1056T).Ten years later, the patient developed FUO resistant to antibiotics; he was admitted in Infective Disease Department where a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed many vegetations on the leads: the biggest one (2 cm × 3 cm) in the right ventricular lead, near tricuspid valve, without continuity with it. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 55%. Blood tests showed the following: white blood cell 15670/uL (89,9% neutrophils), C-reactive protein 110 mg/l, and procalcitonin 0.9 ng/ml. Different blood cultures were done at admission and were positive to Staphylococcus epidermidis. The patient was treated with Daptomycin and Linezolid for 20 days; later on the blood cultures became positive for Staphylococcus capitis and then to Staphylococcus Hominis subsp. hominis, while the patient experienced a progressive decay of the general state, without fever. The TEE, performed about two months later during the therapy, showed reduction of vegetations (the greater one, located on the right ventricular lead, measured 1.1 × 0.9 cm) and a sharp decrease of LVEF (25–30%).The patient was transferred to Cardiology Unit because of two inappropriate ICD’s shocks and the evidence of reduction of pacing impedances of RV Riata lead, associated with electrical noise. Fluoroscopy showed the externalization of Riata lead’s conductors (Figure 1). The patient underwent transvenous leads extraction. The lead showed three outsourcing instances of conductors in the caval, atrial, and ventricular tracts where numerous adhesions and vegetations were evident (Figure 2). The procedure was successfully completed. The cultures set on the extracted leads were positive to St. hominis. The blood cultures became negative but the patient received antibiotic therapy with Daptomycin and Linezolid for fourteen days because the TEE showed a residual thin floating mass 4 cm in length in the right atrium (ghost). The general state improved and the patient refused ICD reimplantation. At discharge blood tests showed the following: white blood cell 5530/uL (64,4% neutrophils), C-reactive protein 8.5 mg/l, and procalcitonin < 0,1 ng/ml. Currently the patient is regularly followed up in our electrophysiology outpatient clinic. Two months later, a transthoracic echocardiography confirmed the thin atrial mass (ghost) and an improvement of LVEF (35%).Externalized Riata lead is a known problem and this case is an example of CIED’s transvenous extraction because of an endocarditis with a supervened lead’s electrical malfunction. The endothelial lesions and alterations of flow near an externalized lead represent the prime mover for the expression of prothrombotic factors and the formation of thrombi [4]. Blood clots can be a culture medium for bacterial species that are found during transient bacteremia. Alteration of flow due to an externalized Riata could have represented the starting point for the endocarditis. The continuous expression of adhesion factors close to an externalized lead may have determined that different bacterial species, during transient bacteremias, have been multiplied resulting in polymicrobial endocarditis. The prolonged septic state, through the expression of proinflammatory factors, may have been responsible for the marked decline in LVEF [5]. The endocarditis could have been a consequence of the lead’s outsourcing; the lead dysfunction appeared later. CIED’s transvenous extraction has allowed a rapid improvement in the clinical state.Externalized Riata lead is a known problem. This clinical case is an example of an endocarditis most likely resulting from outsourcing of the lead. The quarterly or half yearly monitoring of electrical parameters of these leads should be accompanied by a continuous clinical monitoring of the patient in order to identify early signs of infection suspected for endocarditis.The authors declare no conflict of interests.
A Rare Case of Angina Pectoris with the Longest Ectopic Left Main Coronary Artery Arising from Right Sinus of Valsalva and a Prepulmonic Course

The left main coronary artery (LMCA) ranges from 3 to 6 mm in diameter and may be up to 10 to 15 mm in length in humans. We here report a case of the longest anomalous LMCA (56 mm) reported so far in a 35-year-old man with chronic stable angina arising from right sinus of valsalva as seen on conventional angiogram and multidetector computerized tomogram (MDCT). The subject of coronary artery anomalies (CAAs) has undergone profound evolutionary changes related to the definition, morphogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, prognosis, and treatment of these anomalies [1, 2]. About the size of the cigarette butt, the left main coronary artery is a relatively small vessel, yet it is unarguably the most valuable section among the coronary angiogram. It emerges from the aorta through the ostia of the left aortic cusp, within the left sinus of valsalva. It travels from the aorta and passes between the pulmonary trunk and the left atrial appendage, under which it divides into left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex artery. Various anomalies have been described regarding its length, site of origin, and its course.A 35-year-old man, diabetic and hypertensive, presented with exertional angina CCS III despite guideline directed medical therapy. He was 153 cm tall and weighed 52 kg. His vitals were stable and cardiovascular system examinations were within normal limit. An electrocardiogram showed mild ST-T changes. His treadmill test was strongly positive for stress induced myocardial ischemia. Echocardiography revealed normal LV systolic function with an ejection fraction of 60% and trivial mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiogram was performed after proper consent through right radial route. We probed for left main coronary artery from its usual site but it was not visualized even on nonselective injection indicating anomalous origin. Finally it was selectively cannulated from right sinus giving type II LAD (left anterior descending artery) and LCx (left circumflex artery). There was discrete eccentric lesion with critical stenosis (type A lesion) in proximal and distal LCx responsible for his symptoms (Figure 1).It measured 59-60 mm in length in various projections (Figures 2 and 3) by quantitative coronary analysis software (QCA).Right coronary artery was visualized in its normal site which was super dominant (Figure 4). Both LMCA and RCA arising from right sinus could not be well delineated on single injection and therefore MDCT angiogram was done few days later revealing anomalous origin of LMCA from right sinus. On volume rendered (VR) image, it was going up after its origin and, with a reverse U-turn, it was coursing anteriorly over the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) finally giving rise to LAD and LCX (Figure 5). It was measuring 56 mm, thus confirming our diagnosis (Figure 6). LAD had a large septal branch and was terminating before reaching apex; thus it was type II.LMCA normally arises from left sinus of valsalva and has a diameter varying from 3 to 6 mm and length of 10 to 15 mm. The “short” and “long” main trunk (MT) were considered as variants in the length of the left coronary artery [3]. A short MT is considered to be one with a length of <5 mm [4]. Long LMCA is considered when it is over 15 mm in length though exact definition is lacking [5]. In their anatomical study by Reig and Petit, the longest left main trunk was reported to be 23 mm and the average length was  mm [5]. LMCA originating from the right sinus of valsalva (RSV) is extremely rare, and it is incidentally found in approximately 0.017% of all coronary artery angiographies [6]. Left coronary artery originating from the right sinus of valsalva may have 4 courses: between the aortic root and the pulmonary artery (interarterial course), transseptal course (subpulmonic course), anterior course originating from the right ventricle (anterior or prepulmonic course), and posterior course regarding the aortic root (retroaortic course). Ectopic LMCA abnormality being quite uncommon, only few cases with long LMCA have been reported where maximum reported length is 61 mm but all had their usual origin from left sinus only [7–9]. A long LMCA is a coincidental finding. Though a short LMCA has been considered a risk factor in the development of coronary arteriosclerosis, no such relationship has been described between long LMCA and coronary arteriosclerosis [5]. It has been reported that short LMCA is associated with left dominance, whereas relatively long LMCA favours right coronary artery dominance which matches our case [10]. In our case, length of LMCA was almost 61 mm on conventional angiogram in different view and 56 mm on MDCT based on the calculation of the LMCA dimension by three intervention cardiologists and two radiologists and the average length was reported in order to nullify any magnification or calibration errors in measuring its dimensions by QCA software which also makes it unique as previous ones were based on conventional angiogram only. The discrepancy in length may be because QCA has a tendency of little overestimation. Another reason may be that tip of diagnostic catheter is difficult to be differentiated from the origin of left main artery, which might have been included in the measurement. We believe MDCT analysis to be more accurate than QCA. Whenever contemplating any intervention further, a guiding catheter with very good backup support should be chosen such as Amplatz Left or Ikari because hardware has to travel long distance before reaching its target. Another option may be the use of a buddy wire to venture more support of the guide catheter and facilitate the delivery of balloon and stent. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, our case has the longest angiographically documented anomalous left main coronary artery arising from right sinus of valsalva in the literature until now.The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Undilatable Stent Neoatherosclerosis Treated with Ad Hoc Rotational Atherectomy
1Cardiology Department, Hellenic Red Cross Hospital of Athens, Athens,  Greece2Cardiac Surgery Department, Evaggelismos General Hospital, Athens,  GreeceCorrespondence should be addressed to Maria Agelaki; moc.liamg@ikalegamReceived 5 July 2016; Accepted 10 November 2016; Published  10 January 2017Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2017 Michael Koutouzis et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A middle age woman with known ischemic heart disease and old stents in proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was admitted to Coronary Care Unit with acute coronary syndrome. The coronary angiography showed one vessel disease with significant restenosis within the previously implanted stents. The lesion was tough and remained undilatable despite high pressure balloon inflation. Eventually, the balloon ruptured creating a massive dissection of the LAD beginning immediately after the distal part of the undilatable lesion. We proceeded with a challenging ad hoc rotational atherectomy of the lesion and finally stenting of the lesion. In-stent restenosis many years after stent implantation is considered to be mainly due to neoatheromatosis compared to intimal hyperplasia, making lesion treatment more difficult and unpredictable.In-stent stenosis long time after initial stent implantation is not an uncommon finding in our days, but treatment of this type of lesion, especially under unstable conditions, remains a challenge. Our recent knowledge about the histology of these lesions, being comprised mainly of neoatheroma and not neointima hyperplasia, explains the need for different management approach and the high rate of serious complications, like dissection.A 55-year-old female with a known history of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus presented to the Accident and Emergency Department of our hospital with new onset chest pain. The patient had a successful percutaneous coronary intervention in the proximal part of LAD for stable angina 9 years ago and two drug eluting stents (DES) (Taxus Liberte, Boston Scientific) were uneventfully implanted then. On admission, the electrocardiogram showed no significant changes and the cardiac troponin was slightly elevated. The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care unit with the diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. The initial cardiac ultrasound showed normal ejection fraction with no regional wall motion abnormalities and no valvular abnormalities. The patient remained symptomatic with chest pain recurrences after maximum antianginal treatment with intravenous nitroglycerin and b-blockers, so we decided to proceed to emergency coronary angiography.The coronary angiography was performed through the right radial approach after placement of a 6 Fr radial sheath (KDL, China) and it showed one vessel disease with significant restenosis within the previously implanted stents (Figure 1(a)). We decided to proceed to ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention within the restenotic proximal LAD lesion. The patient was loaded with 60 mg prasugrel in addition to the already taken aspirin and intravenous bivalirudin was administered for anticoagulation at 0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/hr. A JL 3.5 6 F guide catheter was exchanged over a 0.035 guidewire and it was placed in the ostium of the left main. We crossed the lesion using a workhorse guidewire (Luge, Boston Scientific) and dilatation was performed with a 2.0 mm semicompliant balloon (Sprinter Legend RX, Medtronic), but the lesion remained undilatable (Figure 1(b)). At the third attempt to expand the lesion using high pressure (at 22 Atm), the balloon ruptured producing a massive dissection of the LAD beginning immediately after the distal part of the undilatable lesion (Figure 1(c)). The presence of radiolucent area during contrast injection suggesting the creation of double lumen without persistence after dye clearance classified the dissection as type B according to the NHLBI classification [1]. The patient started complaining of chest pain and the ECG monitor showed ST segment elevation in lead V1.The placement of a stent distal to the undilatable lesion was attempted unsuccessfully, due to inability to pass the lesion. We did not insist further on in-stent placement with other options, like guide extension catheters, because even if we succeeded the patient would still be in need of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operation, due to the undilatable proximal stenosis. The need for satisfactory lesion dilation was a prerequisite before any other action. Expansion of the stenosis with a cutting balloon failed completely as it did not even manage to go through the critical part of the lesion. In the meantime, the patient was still in pain and she became haemodynamically unstable making inotropic support necessary. Three options were available at this time point:(a)Proceeding with an emergency CABG while on full antiplatelet treatment with prasugrel(b)Treating the dissection with prolonged balloon inflation(c)Proceeding to rotational atherectomy and stentingThe first option was rejected initially due to the very high bleeding risk of the patient and it was reserved as a last resort. Balloon inflation at the site of dissection after so many attempts for dilation was considered very venturous as it could easily augment the dissection even further, making surgical solution inevitable. Moreover, complete vessel occlusion could potentially deteriorate left ventricular function even further and induce a haemodynamic collapse. Taking into account the above-mentioned parameters, we decided to proceed to ad hoc rotational atherectomy, even though coronary dissection is considered as a contraindication for this technique [2]. A  mm over-the-wire balloon (Sprinter OTW, Medtronic) was placed at the distal part of the LAD, the Luge guidewire was removed, and a Floppy Rotawire was placed at the distal part of LAD. Rotational atherectomy was successfully performed with a 1.25 mm burr (Figure 1(d)), but the lesion was still undilatable with a 2 mm semicompliant balloon. We upgraded the burr to a 1.5 mm and successfully rotablated the lesion once more. Dilation was performed using 2.0 mm and 2.5 mm semicompliant balloons (Figure 1(e)) (Sprinter Legend, Medtronic) and the dissected and the previously undilated segment were stented. Three DES were placed in a row starting distally and moving proximally (Resolute Integrity, Medtronic) with a favorable angiographic result (Figure 1(f)). The patient was pain-free at the end of the procedure and a modest troponin I elevation was observed the next day. There was no evidence of left ventricular dysfunction at the echocardiogram performed the next day. The patient was discharged after three days with dual antiplatelet treatment (aspirin 100 mg daily and prasugrel 10 mg daily) and she remains asymptomatic three months after the procedure.This is an interesting case report that highlights the challenges one can confront when treating old in-stent lesions. In-stent restenosis (ISR) through the neointimal formation was thought so far to be a major reason for coronary lumen narrowing after stent deployment. Both histology and physical history of ISR differ among bare metal stents (BMS) and drug eluting stents (DES). In DES, the neointima consists mainly of proteoglycan matrix and to a lower extent, of vascular smooth muscle cells, showing a late catch-up at almost 2 years from implantation [3]. On top of that, new atherosclerotic changes happen due to the chronic inflammation and the incomplete endothelialization of the stent struts. The drug eluting stents are more prone to neoatheroma formation, as this process appears to be more frequent and it takes place earlier compared to BMS. These lesions follow the well-studied course of plaque rupture when they become unstable leading to late or very late stent thrombosis [4]. The effect of in-stent neoatherosclerosis on prognosis is significant, as there is an association with increased major adverse cardiac events. The presence of high levels of low density lipoprotein and C-reactive protein are the major predictors of neoatheroma formation. Time from stent implantation is another crucial and easily identifiable parameter [5]. Despite the different time course of neoatherosclerosis in BMS and DES, when time from implantation exceeds 5 years, then the lesions found are mainly of neoatheroma rich in cholesterol, necrotizing foam cell, and inflammation [6].Nevertheless, the lesion seen during angiography is difficult to distinguish between the usually dilatable in-stent restenosis and the tough stent neoatherosclerosis. The time of intervention after the initial procedure raises the suspicion for the presence of neoatheroma, but angiography has limitations in lesion characterization and it is of a little help. Advanced intracoronary imaging with virtual histology intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) provide high resolution images and they are useful tools for the diagnosis and the treatment especially in complicated cases as in ours [4]. Signal interference from the metal struts of the old stent makes IVUS less efficient in neointima tissue characterization compared to the ultrahigh resolution OCT. Unfortunately, either modality was not an option in our case as the patient became symptomatic and haemodynamically unstable just after the dissection. Time was crucial and we decided to continue treatment based on angiographic criteria only.The presence of neoatherosclerosis makes the lesion tough, difficult to dilate, and more prone to complications like dissection. When the dissection ensues, the risk of complete occlusion of the vessel is high and sealing of the dissection with stents becomes mandatory. When dissection happens and still the stenosis remains critical, then the treatment options are limited. Options other than rotablation, like the cutting wire technique or the high pressure dilation, are usually ineffective and they have an inherent risk of dissection expansion. Even though conservative management of the dissection for 4 weeks is proposed before applying rotablation, in our case the patient was symptomatic with ongoing ACS and immediate action was necessary. Rotational atherectomy with small burr size with minimum advancement and high speed seems to be safe and efficient for the treatment of undilated calcified lesions complicated by dissection [2]. In our case, two sessions of rotablation with increasing burr size was enough to open up the lesion and allow full expansion subsequently with a balloon. The procedure was completed uneventfully, leading to symptoms quiescence and only minimum troponin elevation.In-stent restenosis long time after primary intervention, usually more than five years, should raise suspicion for the presence of neoatherosclerosis. Such a knowledge is crucial in planning management of tight chronic lesions in order to avoid complications like dissection.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
GuideLiner Balloon Assisted Tracking (GBAT): A New Addition to the Interventional Toolbox
Section of Cardiology, St. Boniface Hospital, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB,  CanadaReceived 4 November 2016; Accepted 14 December 2016Academic Editor: Expedito E. RibeiroCopyright © 2016 Basem Elbarouni et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The use of guide extension catheters, such as GuideLiner, allows for increased guide support and facilitates device delivery in tortuous vessels. In cases which the GuideLiner catheter cannot be advanced even with balloon anchoring technique, we inflate a noncompliant balloon protruding from the GuideLiner catheter at nominal pressure and both the GuideLiner and the balloon are advanced over the coronary guidewire through the tortuous segments. This technique can be applied to 5.5 Fr., 6 Fr., and 7 Fr. GuideLiner catheters. This technique is termed GuideLiner Balloon Assisted Tracking (GBAT).With the advent of drug-eluting stents, an increasing number of difficult lesions are treated by percutaneous intervention (PCI). Despite improvements in-stent profile, stent delivery can still be problematic in complex coronary anatomy. Stent delivery failure occurs in up to 5% of all PCI cases, which can result in suboptimal revascularization and has been associated with increased complication rates [1, 2] The GuideLiner catheter, a mother-and-child catheter that can be delivered deep into the coronary artery, provides excellent support and facilitates stent delivery [3, 4]. To increase success rates, the GuideLiner should be delivered as close as possible to, and sometimes across, the target coronary lesion. This sometimes can be difficult through tortuous and calcified vessels or through previously stented segments. We describe a novel technique that would facilitate delivery of the GuideLiner catheter across difficult segments and increase procedural success rates.The “GuideLiner Balloon Assisted Tracking” (GBAT) is relatively easy to perform and has a low risk of complications. The main process of GBAT technique involves the following.Step 1. After successful crossing of the lesion with a guidewire and adequate predilatation, a compliant 1.5 × 15 for a 5.5 Fr. GuideLiner or 2.0 × 15 mm balloon for a 6 Fr. GuideLiner is advanced until protruding halfway beyond the tip of the GuideLiner (Figure 1(a)).Step 2. The balloon is then inflated to nominal pressure and then both the balloon and the GuideLiner are advanced into the vessel while anchoring the guidewire (Figure 1(b)). Once the GuideLiner is advanced to the target segment the balloon is deflated. The same steps are followed for previously stented segments as shown in Figure 1(c).A 72-year-old male presented with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Coronary angiography showed an occluded mid right coronary artery (RCA) with brisk collaterals from the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The RCA was engaged with a 6 Fr. JR 4 guiding catheter. The lesion was crossed easily with a Pilot 50 wire restoring distal flow. The RCA was diffusely diseased with stenosis extending from the distal RCA to the ostium (Figure 2(a)). Despite predilatation with a 2.0 and a 2.5 noncompliant balloon at high pressure, stent delivery proved quite difficult. A 6 French GuideLiner was used but would not advance beyond the ostium of the RCA. The distal anchoring technique with a 2.5 NC balloon was also attempted but was unsuccessful. Using GBAT technique, a 2.0 × 15 m compliant balloon was inflated protruding halfway out of the GuideLiner at 8 atm. The GuideLiner was easily advanced to the distal RCA (Figure 2(b)) facilitating stent delivery and procedural success (Figure 2(c)). The RCA was stented distal to the ostium with a total of five drug-eluting stents.A 51-year-old female with CCS III angina and anterior ischemia on MIBI was referred for coronary angiography. PCI was performed on a 90% mid LAD lesion in a tortuous segment (Figure 3(a)). Despite adequate predilatation a stent could not be delivered across the lesion. A GuideLiner was used and was successfully delivered to the proximal edge of the lesion. Even with the added support of the GuideLiner a stent would not cross the lesion. GBAT technique was used to successfully cross the lesion with the GuideLiner (Figure 3(b)). This facilitated stent delivery and procedure completion (Figure 3(c)). The lesion was stented with two contiguous drug-eluting stents (2.25 × 32 Promus Premier DES distally, 2.5 × 24 proximally) with the stented segment postdilated with a 2.5 noncompliant balloon to high pressure.A 63-year-old male presented with STEMI with ST elevation in the anterior leads. Coronary angiography through the femoral approach showed a diffusely diseased proximal LAD with TIMI 2 flow (Figure 4(a)). Next, the left system was engaged with a 6 Fr. XB 3.5 guiding catheter and predilation with a 3.0 × 15 compliant balloon. Even with aggressive predilation there was difficulty in delivering any stents across the lesion. Next, even with the 5.5 Fr. GuideLiner in the proximal LAD we could not deliver a stent across the lesion. We next inflated a 1.5 × 15 mm balloon that was protruding from the GuideLiner to 8 atm and managed to push the GuideLiner and the inflated balloon past the proximal LAD lesion (Figure 4(b)). Next the mid to proximal LAD was stented with DES with great angiographic result (Figure 4(c)).A 72-year-old male presented to hospital with retrosternal chest pain and elevated biomarkers and was referred for inpatient coronary angiography. He has had previous history of CAD with PCI to the proximal to mid RCA with bare metal stents in 2002. The angiogram showed a hazy lesion within the mid RCA as the likely culprit with moderate ISR in the proximal vessel (Figure 5(a)). The RCA was engaged with a 6 Fr. JR4 guiding catheter. There was brisk collateral filling from the RCA. The lesion was crossed with a workhorse wire and predilated with 2.0 compliant balloon. Due to vessel tortuosity we used a GuideLiner to assist in-stent delivery. After stent deployment we could not deliver our 3.5 noncompliant balloon for postdilatation. We also had difficulty advancing the GuideLiner past the proximal stented segment. Next we advanced a 2.0 × 15 mm compliant balloon halfway protruding from the GuideLiner and inflated the balloon at 8 atm (Figure 5(b)). This allowed the GuideLiner to pass the proximal stented segment and allow for postdilation of the stented segmented (Figure 5(c)).With studies showing excellent outcomes with drug-eluting stents, an increasing number of difficult lesions are treated by PCI. Despite improvements in-stent profile, stent delivery can be challenging in certain lesions. Several techniques are available to operators to help improve success rates in complex PCI procedures. GuideLiner catheter has become a popular and extremely useful tool in treatment of difficult coronary anatomy. It works both by increasing active support and by traversing difficult segments and shortening the distance required to deliver stents. The more distal the GuideLiner is delivered the easier the procedure becomes.The GBAT technique is a modification of the Balloon Assisted Tracking (BAT) technique, a method described to advance guide catheters through radial arteries with extreme bends and loops [5]. The inflated balloon prevents a “razor effect” of the GuideLiner edge with coronary arty wall or stent struts, allowing easy navigation of curved or tortuous segments and reducing damage to previously stented segments. Balloon assisted deep intubation of guiding catheters has been reported previously to assist with thrombus aspiration [6].A commonly used technique in GuideLiner delivery is the balloon anchoring technique, in which a balloon is inflated in the target lesion and used as an anchor to facilitate distal delivery of the GuideLiner. This requires the ability to deliver the balloon to a diseased segment of vessel for inflation and carries a high chance of success. In the first case described, the anchor balloon was attempted but was not successful. However, in the second case, we were not able to even deliver a semicompliant balloon distally due to stent interaction; therefore anchor ballooning was not an option. In the third case, as we had to cross the target lesion to deliver a stent, an anchor balloon would have to be inflated distal to the target lesion in normal vessel, potentially causing local trauma that might require stent extension increasing the risk of in-stent restenosis. In the fourth case, the likely reason for difficulty in advancing the GuideLiner was fresh stent struts preventing advancement of the GuideLiner tip as described in Figure 1(c). Therefore, GBAT should be considered a complementary technique to facilitate GuideLiner assisted PCI, especially when anchor ballooning is unfeasible or undesirable, as demonstrated in our cases.To summarize, GBAT may be considered as a simple and effective approach to facilitate the advancement of the GuideLiner catheter through tortuous, heavily calcified, or previously stented coronary segments. We believe this technique is a useful addition to the armament of interventional skills facilitating high PCI success rates in complex coronary anatomy.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Successful Percutaneous Retrieval of Embolized Septal Occluder Device from Aortic Arch and Placement of a Newer Septal Occluder Device in Combined Procedure
Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia, MO,  USAReceived 25 October 2016; Accepted 14 December 2016Academic Editor: Ramazan AkdemirCopyright © 2016 Natraj Katta et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Embolization of the Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO) device (St. Jude Medical, Minnesota) after percutaneous closure of atrial septal defect (ASD) is a rare and potentially catastrophic complication. Percutaneous retrieval of the embolized device is gaining ground as an acceptable method, although these patients are usually subsequently referred for open surgical closure of the ASD. We present a unique case of percutaneous retrieval embolized ASO device and placement of newer larger ASO device in a single procedure. A 75-year-old female patient with history of persistent atrial fibrillation after multiple failed cardioversions and septum secundum type of ASD presented with worsening exertional dyspnea of six-month duration. She was previously intolerant to amiodarone. She underwent elective catheter based atrial fibrillation ablation followed by closure of the ASD during a combined percutaneous procedure. ASD closure was performed using a 16 mm Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO) device after measuring the diameter of the defect at 15.4 ± 1.0 mm (Figure 1(a)) with sizing balloon and 15 mm (Figure 1(b)) with intracardiac echocardiogram (ICE). After the deployment of the device, ICE showed minimal residual shunt flow confirming correct position. The following day, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed severe right to left shunt indicating recurrence of ASD, without visualization of the ASO device. A chest radiograph (Figure 2(a)) showed the embolized ASO device in the aortic arch. Patient had no new symptoms except recurrence of atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion. Patient was taken to cardiac catheterization laboratory for possible percutaneous retrieval of the embolized ASO device and placement of a newer device. 6 F × 11 cm sheath was placed in right femoral artery. Aortic arch angiography was performed with a 5 F × 110 cm pigtail catheter (Figure 2(b)). 6 F sheath was then exchanged with a 10 F × 80 cm long cook sheath (Cook Medical Inc. Indiana). Using 6 F 12–20 mm × 120 cm En-Snare System (Merit Medical Systems, Inc., Utah) through a 6 F Hockey Stick II guiding catheter (Medtronic Inc., Minnesota), we were able to snare the metallic tip on the right atrial disc of ASO device (Figure 2(c)). Subsequently, entire device was collapsed into the long sheath which was safely removed (Figure 2(d)). Thereafter, a 20 mm ASO device placed using a 9 F Amplatzer delivery system (St. Jude Medical, Minnesota), after resizing of the defect. This time the sizing balloon yielded diameter of 17.41 mm (Figure 3(a)) and ICE of 18 mm (Figure 3(b)). Both ICE and TTE showed properly positioned ASO device with minimal residual shunt. No procedure related complications occurred. Patient was discharged 2 days later.The incidence of occluder device embolization after ASD closure is 0.55%–1.4% [1, 2]. Nearly half of the embolized ASO devices tend to lodge in the left atrium and aorta [3]. According to the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database, only a minority (16.7%) of embolized devices are retrieved using percutaneous approach [2]. Undersized device, floppy or inadequate rim, device malposition, and excessive tension on the delivery cable during the deployment are the possible mechanisms for device embolization [2]. In our case, we believe that undersizing was the possible mechanism, which in turn was probably due to noncircular shape of the defect. In previous case reports, Gooseneck type of snare system was used [4–6], whereas we are able to retrieve the device using the En-Snare System, showing that there are various options in choosing the retrieval system, although merits of one system over the others are unclear. According to a survey of the ASO company-designated proctors, approximately half of the patients had percutaneous closure of the ASD after the embolized device retrieval, but it is not reported whether they were done as a combined procedure or at a later date [7]. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first reported case of percutaneous retrieval of embolized device and percutaneous placement of newer device performed as combined procedure. We also performed atrial fibrillation ablation with ASD closure on the same day. As arrhythmia control is difficult to achieve with ASD closure alone in patients with atrial fibrillation and technical challenges associated with trans-septal access after device closure, it is considered appropriate to perform atrial fibrillation ablation prior to ASD closure [8, 9].Percutaneous retrieval of the embolized ASO device is still not widely performed. Also, there is no consensus regarding the appropriate timing of the reclosure of the ASD percutaneously after the retrieval of embolized device. With proper planning, percutaneous retrieval and placement of newer device can be safely performed in single setting. We also believe that, in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial septal defect, it is reasonable to perform atrial fibrillation ablation prior to ASD closure.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Asymptomatic Pulmonary Vein Stenosis: Hemodynamic Adaptation and Successful Ablation
1University of Miami at Holy Cross Hospital, Fort Lauderdale, FL,  USA2South Florida Multispecialty Associates, LLC, Miami Beach, FL,  USA3Holy Cross Hospital, Fort Lauderdale, FL,  USAReceived 15 August 2016; Accepted 4 December 2016Academic Editor: Christian MachadoCopyright © 2016 John J. Lee et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Pulmonary vein stenosis is a well-established possible complication following an atrial fibrillation ablation of pulmonary veins. Symptoms of pulmonary vein stenosis range from asymptomatic to severe exertional dyspnea. The number of asymptomatic patients with pulmonary vein stenosis is greater than originally estimated; moreover, only about 22% of severe pulmonary vein stenosis requires intervention. We present a patient with severe postatrial fibrillation (AF) ablation pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis, which was seen on multiple imaging modalities including cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiogram, lung perfusion scan, and pulmonary angiogram. This patient did not have any pulmonary symptoms. Hemodynamic changes within a stenosed pulmonary vein might not reflect the clinical severity of the obstruction if redistribution of pulmonary artery flow occurs. Our patient had an abnormal lung perfusion and ventilation (V/Q) scan, suggesting pulmonary artery blood flow redistribution. The patient ultimately underwent safe repeat atrial fibrillation ablation with successful elimination of arrhythmia.Pulmonary vein stenosis, which occurs in 1% to 3% of cases, is a well-recognized potential complication after radiofrequency (RF) ablation of pulmonary veins. The clinical manifestations of pulmonary vein stenosis vary widely from asymptomatic to severe exertional dyspnea. While these symptoms are primarily affected by the severity and number of affected veins, pulmonary blood flow redistribution is thought to be one of the factors contributing to blunting clinical symptoms after RF ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) [1]. We report a case of compensatory hemodynamic change that leads to asymptomatic pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis with subsequent successful ablation.A 56-year-old male with history of AF, status after ablation, eight years ago at an outside hospital, presented with recurrent AF. Five years after his initial ablation, the patient developed symptomatic palpitations due to atrial fibrillation and he was prescribed flecainide and metoprolol. Despite antiarrhythmic therapy, the patient continued to have symptomatic atrial fibrillation with palpitations but no shortness of breath. The patient was taken for AF ablation. The preablation echocardiogram demonstrated normal ventricular function and pulmonary pressures. The preprocedural computed tomography (CT) scan along with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was done on the procedural table prior to the transeptal puncture but did not pick up the pulmonary vein stenosis. Pulmonary vein potential mapping noted that there was a potential at the ostium of the left superior pulmonary vein. There was also difficulty advancing the catheter into the left superior pulmonary vein due to a possible obstruction. Direct angiography of the left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) confirmed complete PV stenosis. The procedure was aborted in lieu of further diagnostic work up. A higher resolution cardiac CT angiogram (Figure 1(a)) and left atrium 3D reconstruction (Figure 1(b)) was used to confirm subtotal occlusion of the left superior pulmonary venous trunk. A lung perfusion scan revealed significantly decreased left upper lung perfusion (Figure 2) with the left lung contributing approximately 18% of the lung function and the right lung contributing 82% of the total lung function. A levophase angiogram of the right middle lobe pulmonary arterial system demonstrated venous return confined to the area of the lung supplied by the arterial vasculature. The levophase pulmonary angiogram demonstrated well developed collateral circulation from the left upper lobe to the mid segment of the left lung (Figures 3(a) and 3(b), resp.). After cardiac workup, it was concluded that this pulmonary vein stenosis is chronically totally occluded and less amenable to percutaneous intervention for reestablishment of flow. Ultimately, the decision to intervene to relieve the stenosis and to repeat AF ablation on the remaining pulmonary veins was left to the patient. The patient initially opted for continuance of antiarrhythmic drug therapy. However, due to persistence of breakthrough atrial fibrillation despite antiarrhythmic therapy, the patient ultimately underwent repeat atrial fibrillation ablation procedure two years after his initial presentation to our institution.The frequency of PV stenosis, a well-established possible complication following an AF ablation of pulmonary veins, has been declining due to the improvement of technique. However, depending on the technique and diagnostic modalities used, PV stenosis occurs as often as 40% of patients who underwent AF ablation [1]. PV stenosis acquired after AF ablation varies in severity from asymptomatic to nonspecific symptoms including persistent cough, hemoptysis, and exertional dyspnea [2]. Given these nonspecific clinical symptoms, physicians should be highly suspicious of the diagnosis of PV stenosis in postablation patients and further evaluate patients with multiple imaging modalities. In most cases of PV stenosis, including severe cases, clinical symptoms improve without intervention presumably due to the involvement of pulmonary artery blood flow redistribution [1]. Only about 22% of severe PV stenosis, defined as more than 50% luminal occlusion, requires intervention [3]. Most patients improve spontaneously likely due to the compensatory hemodynamics [1]. Although it is hard to demonstrate PV stenosis and its hemodynamic adaptation by imaging, the absence of perfusion on a lung perfusion scan can be suggestive of pulmonary artery to systemic collaterals (Figure 2) [4, 5]. Such hemodynamic changes are thought to be similar to those adaptations observed in congenital PV atresia [6]. In congenital unilateral PV atresia, due to increased venous pressure, there is retrograde flow of the ipsilateral pulmonary artery creating systemic to pulmonary arterial collaterals [6]. This would make the perfusion of the affected lung absent on a perfusion scan, as it was observed in our patient’s perfusion scan [6]. Moreover, we suggest that the collateral vasculature (Figure 3(b)), connecting the left upper pulmonary artery to the left lower pulmonary artery, is for lung parenchymal preservation.Ultimately, the patient underwent successful repeat atrial fibrillation ablation employing a wide antral circumferential ablation technique with successful resolution of the left superior pulmonary vein. The patient’s pacemaker was interrogated six months after ablation and demonstrated successful elimination of atrial fibrillation (Figure 4).We present a patient with severe post-AF ablation PV stenosis without pulmonary symptoms.Our patient’s perfusion scan, which demonstrated no perfusion of the affected lung, is suggestive of pulmonary artery blood flow redistribution via pulmonary artery to systemic collaterals. The patient ultimately underwent safe repeat atrial fibrillation ablation with successful elimination of arrhythmia.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Complete Resolution of Tumor Burden of Primary Cardiac Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Primary cardiac tumors are a rare set of benign and malignant neoplasms found in the heart or pericardium. We describe a patient presenting with nonspecific symptoms and ultimately diagnosed with primary cardiac non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (PCL). Our patient had extensive tumor in the right ventricle, which extended into the right atrium and right ventricular outflow tract. The tumor also encased the right coronary artery, which manifested as ischemic changes on EKG and cardiac MRI. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and achieved complete remission, with dramatic and full resolution of the mass on repeat echocardiography in nine weeks. More studies are needed to understand the optimal management and prognosis of patients with PCL.A 78-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension presented to the emergency department with fever and shortness of breath. Three weeks prior, the patient had presented to her primary care physician with fever to 102.0°F and dyspnea on exertion. A chest X-ray demonstrated a left lower lobe infiltrate, and she was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. She was prescribed 7 days of levofloxacin as an outpatient. Despite antibiotic treatment, her symptoms worsened and progressed to lower extremity edema, night sweats, anorexia, and nausea. During this interval, she denied chest pain, cough, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Given these persistent and novel symptoms, she presented to our hospital for further evaluation and management.On initial evaluation, she was febrile to 101.3°F, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic to 90% on room air. Physical exam showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally on her pulmonary exam and trace lower extremity edema. Her cardiac exam was normal other than tachycardia. Laboratory evaluation, including white-cell count and lactate level, was normal. Blood cultures were obtained, and she was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. The patient’s initial presentation was thought to be progression of her pneumonia secondary to inadequate outpatient treatment.A computed tomography scan with iodinated contrast of the chest was performed. It showed a large low to intermediate density (30–50 HU) right ventricular mass extending into the right atrium and main pulmonary outflow tract which encased the right coronary artery. Bilateral pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, and a 25  32 mm prevascular lymph node in the mediastinum were also present. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound examination was negative for venous thromboembolism. Computed tomography of the abdomen was significant for a 32  22 mm left adrenal mass and a 26  23 mm para-aortic lymph node. Brain imaging was unremarkable.The right ventricular mass was presumed to be the cause of the patient’s presentation and further characterization of the mass was needed. Echocardiography showed a large lobular mass that filled most of the right ventricle, extending both proximally and distally into the right atrium and right ventricular outflow tract. The mass appeared adherent to the right atrium and ventricle and created both near-complete right ventricular cavity obliteration and significant obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract with a peak gradient of 27 mmHg (normal RVOT gradient < 4 mmHg) (Figures 1 and 2). A cardiac MRI confirmed a large, lobulated, heterogeneous right ventricular mass measuring 57  79  97 mm (in AP, transverse, and craniocaudal dimensions), causing limited opening of the tricuspid valve. The mass was predominantly isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Its imaging characteristics were most concerning for invasive malignancy (Figures 3 and 4).Interestingly, the presenting and subsequent EKGs showed normal sinus rhythm but with signs of ischemia in the inferior wall. The patient denied any symptoms of chest pain during and preceding this presentation. Right and left heart catheterizations were performed to biopsy the mass and assess for coronary artery disease that could explain the evidence of inferior wall ischemia on EKG. The left heart catheterization demonstrated severe stenosis of the distal right coronary artery due to encasement from the cardiac mass, which correlated to the territory of distal infarction (Figure 5). Interestingly, the normal translational movement of the right coronary artery with each systole was absent, likely, due to fixative compression of the mass. Additionally, cardiac MRI showed late gadolinium enhancement in the territory of the inferior wall.Endomyocardial biopsy of the mass was performed. Pathology showed an aberrant population of CD5(−) and CD10(−) large B-lymphocytes compatible with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Figures 6 and 7). Cytology from pleural fluid corroborated this finding.The patient was diagnosed with primary cardiac non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The extent of her tumor burden was impressive, as was its external compression of the right coronary artery leading to evidence of ischemia on both EKG and cardiac MRI.The patient was transferred to the oncology service and started on reduced dose R-CHOP (rituximab max rate of 300 mg/hour, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, doxorubicin hydrochloride 35 mg/m2, vincristine sulfate 1.4 mg/m2 with max 2 mg, and prednisone 100 mg daily for 5 days) chemotherapy and closely monitored for tumor lysis syndrome. After one course of chemotherapy, the patient was discharged with a plan for continued chemotherapy as an outpatient.She subsequently received 7 cycles of chemotherapy. Remarkably, transthoracic echocardiography and PET/CT performed 9 weeks after her initial diagnosis of primary cardiac lymphoma revealed complete resolution of the right ventricular mass, pleural effusions, as well as adrenal nodule, and mediastinal and para-aortic lymph nodes (Figure 2).Primary cardiac tumors are rare, with the incidence ranging from 0.0017% to 0.33% based on eight large autopsy series [1]. Most primary cardiac tumors are benign, making up 58–77% of all primary cardiac tumors. Atrial myxoma is the most common benign primary cardiac tumor (24–37%). Malignant tumors of the heart are less common and comprise 24–42% of all primary cardiac tumors. Angiosarcoma is the most common malignant primary cardiac tumor, representing 7-8% of all primary cardiac tumors [1]. The incidence of cardiac involvement in metastatic lymphoma ranges from 7.5 to 9.3% in one case series [2]. In contrast, the incidence of primary cardiac lymphoma is exceedingly rare, ranging from 0.04% to 1.8% of all primary cardiac tumors [1].Primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) is defined as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma exclusively or mainly located in the heart or pericardium [3]. PCL is primarily found in the right side of the heart, the most frequent location being the right atrium [4, 5]. Most patients present with nonspecific symptoms such as dyspnea, edema, chest pain, or palpitations [4–6]. Studies have suggested that the diagnosis of PCL should be considered in patients presenting with a cardiac mass or unexplained, refractory pericardial effusion, and heart failure [4]. Additionally, PCL has been associated with arrhythmias, heart block, or angina. In our case, the EKG showed evidence of inferior ischemia, which was likely due to external compression of the distal RCA by the tumor.Multimodality cardiac imaging studies are a cornerstone of the diagnosis of PCL helping to assess the location, size, and character of the cardiac mass. While cardiac tumors are often first identified on transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiogram is superior to transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in identifying cardiac lesions, identifying 92% versus 55% of lesions in one study. This advantage is primarily due to its ability to better characterize lesions in the left atrium, left atrial appendage, and SVC [7]. Gadolinium enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can detect tumor location and morphology and has a >90% sensitivity in detecting cardiac lymphoma [4, 8]. The use of multiple imaging modalities, such as TTE, which best demonstrates the functional impact of a cardiac mass, as well as CMR for sizing, location, and tumor characterization is likely the optimal approach in the diagnosis of cardiac lymphoma [9]. Although imaging studies are important in the work-up of a cardiac mass, tissue diagnosis via endomyocardial biopsy (or other tissue biopsy) is necessary to confirm any suspected diagnosis due to the imperfect specificity of these imaging studies.There are many different types of lymphoma that affect the heart as primary tumors. One review of all reported cases [] between 1995 and 2002 demonstrated that the majority of primary cardiac lymphomas are diffuse large cell (60%), with the second most common being large cell (5%), immunoblastic (5%), lymphoblastic (5%), diffuse medium-cell (5%), diffuse small-cell (5%), and diffuse (5%) [6]. In this review, specific treatment was given to 36 patients with complete remission obtained in only 15 patients. Of the 25 patients who died, average survival time was 16 weeks (range 1 to 48 weeks) [6].Primary cardiac lymphoma is highly sensitive to chemotherapy, and so it is widely used as the primary treatment modality. In a recent review of 197 reported cases of PCL, chemotherapy was given to 89% of patients, with CHOP and subsequently R-CHOP being the most common regimens. Seventy-nine percent of treated patients with follow-up data available had a partial or complete response to therapy by any modality, with 59% achieving complete response [10]. Partial or complete surgical resection was performed in 28% of patients and radiation therapy in 20% of patients [10]. These debulking procedures are generally reserved for cases of PCL in which there is severe cardiac obstruction and/or hemodynamic compromise as a result of the mass. To our knowledge, there have been no studies comparing chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy with either surgical resection or radiation therapy. This is likely due to the rarity of the disease.Reported complete remission rates have ranged from 38% to 71%, illustrating the limited knowledge of this disease [6, 11]. Risk factors for poor prognosis include immunocompromised state, extracardiac disease, left ventricular involvement, and the absence of arrhythmia. Extracardiac disease and left ventricle involvement are thought to represent greater burden of disease. It has also been postulated that arrhythmias lead to earlier presentation, imaging, and thus detection of disease [10]. Further studies are needed to elucidate the management and prognosis of this disease.PCL is difficult to diagnose given vague symptomatology and nonspecific signs on physical exam. Patients with PCL often present with a nonresolving, unexplained respiratory complaint as did our patient. Multimodality imaging is important in guiding the work-up of cardiac masses, though it is insufficient to confirm a diagnosis. For the latter, tissue biopsy is necessary. There are no randomized clinical trials comparing the treatment regimens for primary cardiac lymphoma. These regimens are generally devised by an oncologist and directed at the type of lymphoma involved. Indeed, studies show that R-CHOP is the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen with a strong response rate. Surgical resection and radiotherapy appear to have some benefit in cases of severe obstruction, but the addition of either or both has not been proven superior to chemotherapy alone.The authors declare that there is no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
A Large Left Ventricle Myxoma: Presenting with Epigastric Pain and Weight Loss
1Department of Anesthesiology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Madani Heart Hospital, Tabriz,  Iran2Department of Cardiovascular Anesthesia, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Madani Heart Hospital, Tabriz,  IranReceived 6 October 2016; Accepted 4 December 2016Academic Editor: Hiroaki KitaokaCopyright © 2016 Solmaz Fakhari  and Eissa Bilehjani. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Cardiac myxomas are the most common benign tumors found in the heart. They usually appear in the left atrium. Those originating from the left ventricle (LV) are rare. Although clinical presentation may vary, dyspnea and embolism are the most commonly reported symptoms. In the present case study, a 27-year-old woman with a large myxoma originating from the left ventricular free wall is studied. She had atypical complaints, mainly epigastric discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. She was hospitalized for acute abdomen, but subsequent investigations revealed a large myxoma that fully filled the LV and severely compromised the flow of the aortic and mitral valves. After successful emergency tumor resection, all symptoms disappeared. The uncommon presentation caused by these tumors is discussed in this study.Cardiac myxomas are the most common tumors found in the heart [1, 2]. Although myxomas are benign tumors, they can cause significant morbidity and mortality [1, 3]. Tumors are found mainly in the left atrium but can grow in any chamber [2]. Generally, left ventricular (LV) myxomas are extremely rare. Myxomas usually originate from the septum and appear as systemic embolization, episodes of syncope as the consequence of arrhythmia or LV outflow tract obstruction [4–10], and systemic symptoms resulting from interleukin-6 production by tumor cells. In rare case reports, the tumor originates from the posterior [7] or lateral wall of the LV [4, 10]. Although echocardiography has improved tumor detection, diagnosed left ventricular myxomas are still rare. Among various clinical presentations, syncope and dyspnea are the most common reported symptoms [7]. Cardiac myxomas may cause emboli to the central nervous system and elsewhere in the vascular tree [10, 11]. When patients present with nonspecific symptoms, the tumor may be misdiagnosed for a long time until the onset of more significant embolic complications, such as a stroke with functional impairment [6]. The current inquiry presents and discusses a patient with a large left ventricular myxoma whose main complaints were epigastric discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.The patient was a 27-year-old woman (weight = 48 kg, height = 171 cm) admitted to a general hospital with primary diagnosis of acute abdomen because of acute epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. She had a history of activity-induced dyspnea and chest discomfort for 18 months. Anorexia, weight loss (approximately 10 kg), and episodes of flushing and syncope while standing were added to her symptoms at the past 3 months. In spite of a few medical visits at the past year, there was not any definitive diagnosis. Episodic epigastric pain referred to the right shoulder lasted for 15 min; nausea and vomiting were reported as the main symptoms in the last two weeks. In the physical examination, she was cachectic, acyanotic, ill, and tachypneic with respiratory distress. Her vital signs were as follows: a regular heart rate 100 beat/min, blood pressure 80/45 mmHg, axillary temperature 36.7°C, and respiratory rate 24 per minute. Respiratory sounds decreased in the lower half of the lungs. There was a muffled first heart sound with a moderate holosystolic murmur in the apex. There was not either guarding or tenderness on abdomen or abdominal organomegaly. Laboratory data were normal except for a mild increase in ESR. The chest X-ray revealed increased chest/thoracic ratio and bilateral plural effusion. A thoracic and abdominal CT scan revealed cardiomegaly with a large mass ( mm) in LV and bilateral pleural effusion without any pathologic findings in the abdomen. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was done as a final diagnostic modality and reported a completely occupied LV with a large nonhomogenous mass protruding into aortic valve and severely compromised ejection fraction (0.15), limited valve opening, and flow through mitral and aortic valves. Preoperative lab tests were showing the normal values for blood, renal, and hepatic function tests. She was transferred to our heart hospital for an emergency surgery. With invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring, anesthesia was induced using midazolam 10 mg, ethomidate 10 mg, fentanyl 100 μg, and cisatracurium 10 mg. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed severely decreased LV function; LV chamber was totally filled with a large mass ( mm), compromised mitral valve opening (moderate regurgitation), and a systolic protrusion of the mass to the aorta (approximately 1.5–2 cm). On the TEE, it seemed that the mass was pedunculated, originating from the LV lateral wall (Figure 1). Using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and a transmitral and aortic root approach, the huge multilobulated jelly-like mass was resected piece-by-piece. It had been attached to the apical-lateral wall. After deairing of the heart, CPB discontinued using dobutamine infusion 10 μg/kg/min with a sinus rhythm. Postbypass TEE revealed a moderate MR with severe LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 0.10–0.15). Postoperative period was without any complication, and almost all the complaints were resolved rapidly. Renal, hepatic, and routine blood tests were within normal limits postoperatively. A blood sample was prepared and sent to a referral regional lab in order to measure the serum IL-6 concentration, in the second postoperative day. The patient left the ICU and hospital on the third and seventh postoperative days, respectively, in a good clinical condition. TTE on the third postoperative day showed a moderate eccentric mitral regurgitation (MR) with LVEF of 0.30. Pathologic examination confirmed myxoma diagnosis. Three months later, TTE showed a normal heart (LVEF 0.45) with only mild MR. Lab report presented the postoperative serum IL-6 concentration (assayed by Bender MedSystem, Austria) as a normal value (2.98 pg/mL).Primary cardiac tumors are extremely rare with a prevalence of 0.001% to 0.3% upon autopsy [1, 2, 12]. In all age groups, benign primary cardiac tumors are more common compared with malignant tumors (75%), and the majority of benign tumors are myxomas [1, 2]. Myxomas originate from the endocardium, usually the interatrial septum [2, 4]. According to previous studies, most myxomas grow in the left atrium (70–90%), and only a small percentage (15–20%) is found in the right atrium. Tumors may rarely originate from the right or left ventricles [13].Clinical symptoms are usually nonspecific and may not lead to tumor diagnosis for a long period. Until 60 years ago, these tumors were considered a postmortem diagnostic event [12]. Along with improvements in diagnostic modalities, ante-mortem diagnosis and surgical resection of the tumors have become more feasible [12]. The most simple and effective tool for its diagnosis is echocardiography. This technique precisely locates the tumor and defines its extension [12, 14]. The clinical signs and symptoms of the tumor are atypical and vary greatly [14, 15]. They may be related to the following mechanisms:(I)The tumor mass can interfere with valve function mechanically and obstruct intracardiac blood flow.(II)Local invasion of the tumor can lead to arrhythmias or pericardial effusions with tamponade.(III)Pieces of the tumor can cause systemic or pulmonary embolization on the left or right side of the heart, respectively.(IV)The tumor may produce and release a few substances into the circulatory system which may be responsible for inflammatory or autoimmune problems (as interleukin 6).Some tumors (4%) produce no symptoms and are diagnosed only as an accidental finding [1].The long list of reported symptoms and signs includes chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, fever, malaise and fatigue, weight loss, pancreatitis [9], cough, palpitation, cyanosis and clubbing, Raynaud’s phenomenon, arthralgia, myalgia, muscle weakness, loss of hair, dizziness, fainting, aphasia, peripheral embolism [16], syncope, transient ischemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) [10–12, 17], sudden cardiac death [5, 12, 18], and heart failure [19]. These symptoms may accompany the change in body position. Although the cause of constipation is not well known, it may disappear rapidly after tumor resection [12]. Robert et al. reported a case of left ventricular myxoma presented with sudden transient visual loss, frequent palpitations, and dizziness episodes [10].Recent studies suggest that myxomas produce and release interleukins into the blood circulatory system, which may be responsible for the wide spectrum of systemic inflammatory or autoimmune problems [9]. Symptoms such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia may be related to the production of interleukin 6 (IL-6), a principal mediator of the acute phase protein response [9, 13]. The type and duration of clinical presentation of myxoma depends on tumor size, location, mobility, growth rate, and histopathologic features [4, 7]. The current study case encountered a cluster of symptoms including epigastric pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss, which may easily mislead the general medical practitioners to come up with a misdiagnosis. If the long-term history of the patient had been considered, the certain markers of low cardiac output state (activity-induced fatigue, dyspnea and chest discomfort, episodes of flushing, and syncope upon standing) would have been diagnosed in the patient. Thus, the heart mass could be discovered easily by searching logical explanations for all of the signs. Mitral regurgitation can cause dyspnea [14], and LV inflow and outflow obstruction can cause activity induced fatigue, chest discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, syncope upon standing, nausea, and vomiting. Emboli to systemic circulation can mimic acute abdomen syndrome, nausea, and vomiting and ultimately production of interleukin 6 can cause flushing, elevated ESR, and fever. Accordingly, the study patient did not certainly have any unusual presentation. She had various symptoms for a long period, but because of the absence of a clinical suspicion, her problem remained undiagnosed for nearly 18 months. According to previous reports, LV myxomas usually grow from the septal endocardium [18], and there are only two case reports of growth from an LV free wall [10]. Thus, the study case is a new and rare case of myxoma grown from the LV apical-lateral wall.Left ventricular myxoma may produce various systemic and nonspecific symptoms including anorexia, nausea/vomiting, weight loss, flushing, syncope, and abdominal discomfort. The basic action for its diagnosis is a good clinical suspicion and judgment, and then a conventional echocardiographic exam can usually confirm the diagnosis.None of the authors report any conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Thirty Years Later: Evolution of Treatment for Acute Left Main Coronary Artery Occlusion
Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center and the Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa,  IsraelReceived 30 September 2016; Accepted 24 November 2016Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2016 Moshe Y. Flugelman et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Acute occlusion of left main coronary artery is a catastrophic event. We describe two patients with acute occlusion of the left main coronary artery treated thirty years apart. The first patient was treated in 1982 and survived the event without revascularization but developed severe heart failure. His survival was so unusual that it merited a case report at that time. The second patient was treated at the end of 2015. Early revascularization resulted in myocardial reperfusion and near normal left ventricular function. These patients exemplify the progress in therapeutic cardiology over the last 30 years.Thirty-three years ago we treated a 55-year-old man that presented with half an hour of chest pain and developed ventricular fibrillation. The patient was resuscitated but developed cardiogenic shock. Later he was found to have left main coronary artery (LMCA) occlusion. He survived the event after long hospitalization and developed severe heart failure due to poor left ventricular function [1]. Recently we treated a 62-year-old woman that presented with severe chest pain and cardiogenic shock due to acute left main coronary occlusion. The patient was catheterized shortly after arrival, stent was placed in her LMCA, and after 14 days of hospitalization she was discharged with nearly normal left ventricular function. Thirty years ago survival after acute LMCA occlusion was rare and merited publication of a case report [1]; it is still uncommon; nonetheless the following two cases illustrate the progress made in cardiology over the last 30 years [2, 3].A 55-year-old man, heavy smoker with no history of ischemic heart disease, developed ventricular fibrillation 30 minutes after the onset of severe retrosternal chest pain. Sinus rhythm was restored after 6 direct-current cardioversions combined with lidocaine infusion. After resuscitation, pulmonary edema developed; the patient had a systolic blood pressure of 60 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 120 beats/min, and frequent premature ventricular contractions. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with frequent ventricular premature contractions and an acute extensive anterior myocardial infarction. The cardiac index, measured with a thermodilution Swan-Ganz catheter, was 1 liter/min/m2. An intra-aortic counterpulsation balloon (IACPB) was inserted through the right femoral artery and blood pressure increased to 110/70 mm Hg and the cardiac index to 1.9 liters/min/m2. Mechanical assistance was combined with intravenous treatment of glucose-potassium-insulin solutions, oral isosorbide-dinitrate, digoxin, and diuretic agents. Cardiac catheterization and angiography, performed 15 days after admission, revealed a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 35 mm Hg, a large aneurysm of the anterior and apical regions, and a normal contraction of the inferior wall. Coronary arteriography demonstrated complete obstruction of the LMCA (Figure 1(a)) while the right coronary artery was normal. There was no collateral filling of the left coronary system. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 16% with mechanical assistance and 5% without assistance. After 26 days, the patient developed a shaking chill and the IACPB was removed. The patient was discharged after 40 days. By this time he had signs of moderate congestive heart failure but no angina pectoris and was in New York Heart Association functional class III. On discharge, the cardiac index was 1.8 liters/min/m2. Radionuclide angiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%. A year later he was in functional class III. Three years after the acute event he died of heart failure complications (this case report is a modified version of reference 1 and is published with permission from Elsevier).A 62-year-old patient with history of smoking and angina on effort for two weeks prior to hospitalization developed severe chest pain and presented at the emergency room in pulmonary edema and blood pressure of 65 mm Hg. Her ECG showed acute myocardial infarction in the anterior wall. The patient was transferred immediately to the catheterization laboratory and normal right coronary artery was demonstrated via the right radial artery. Total occlusion of the left main was demonstrated using a 6F guiding catheter (Figure 1(b)) and a hydrophilic guidewire was passed through the occluded left main coronary artery to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Immediately after passing the guidewire the circumflex artery was demonstrated (Figure 1(c)). An aspiration device was passed over the wire down the LAD. A red thrombus was aspirated and flow was restored in the LAD (Figure 1(d)). An LMCA stenosis and an LAD stenosis were demonstrated and a drug eluting stent (DES) was placed from the proximal LMCA to the proximal LAD. A second DES was placed in the LAD as LAD distal to the first stent was significantly narrowed. As blood pressure was still low, IACPB was placed via the right femoral artery and the patient was maintained on heparin and dopamine. On days two and three after catheterization the patient had two episodes of pressing chest pain that lasted for 30 minutes and reminded the patient of the symptoms at arrival. Immediately after the second episode that patient had had a second catheterization via the right radial artery which demonstrated TIMI grade III flow in the left coronary system (Figure 1(e)). Echocardiography demonstrated ejection fraction of 50% with mild apical dyskinesia. The patient recovered slowly over the next 10 days and was discharged 12 days after admission.Over the last three decades treatment of STEMI changed dramatically. The introduction of intravenous thrombolytic therapy and then percutaneous interventions (PCI) reduced in-hospital mortality of young STEMI patients from 30% to <5% [4]. Thirty years ago a patient with STEMI that survived to leave the hospital had had high chances of suffering from significantly reduced left ventricular function and symptoms of heart failure. Nowadays, patients with STEMI that arrive early and are treated with PCI have a better left ventricular function and better prognosis.Acute occlusion of the left main coronary artery is usually a fatal event, yet 4% of patients that arrive with STEMI and undergo PCI are reported to have left main narrowing and occlusion [5–8]. Reports of survival after acute total occlusion of left main coronary artery were rare prior to the thrombolytic era and therefore the report of the patient we treated in 1982 was published. The patients that we treated in 1982 survived the acute event and left the hospital with ejection function of 10% and NYHA grade III symptoms while the patient treated in 2015 left the hospital with ejection function of 50% and no symptoms. In both patients we used IACPB which is not recommended in current guidelines for treating STEMI patients, yet use of IACPB was a standard practice in STEMI patients with low blood pressure prior to introduction of reperfusion therapies. Although two controlled studies showed no survival benefits of IACPB in STEMI patients, the use of IACPB in the above reported patients contributed to survival of these patients that were presented with low blood pressure and cardiogenic shock [9]. Radial approach is currently the most used approach for coronary catheterization and is associated with fewer complications [10]. As demonstrated in Figures 1(a) and 1(b) the first patient was catheterized from the femoral artery while the second, recent patient was catheterized from the radial artery. Using radial approach required an additional vascular access for the IACPB but, importantly, allows an uninterrupted hemodynamic support from the IACPB during the coronary intervention.Recommendation for thrombus aspiration in acute STEMI is another component of STEMI treatment that was modified recently. After initial enthusiasm [11] thrombus aspiration use has declined as its effectivity in improving outcomes in STEMI was not proved in large-scale studies [12, 13]. We chose to use aspiration device as large bulk of thrombus was observed after passing the guidewire. Aspiration of a large thrombus can improve visualization but may be associated with thrombus dislodgement to the aorta.In summary, conceptual and technical progress has changed the prognosis of STEMI patients in general and in patients with acute LMCA occlusion more specifically as exemplified in the descriptions of the two patients that were treated for the same conditions 30 years apart.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.

We present a case of a 79-year-old man with coronary artery bypass graft where subclavian artery stenosis was found incidentally. In this asymptomatic case, we have merged clinical and multiple imaging modalities to secure the diagnosis and treatment plan.Subclavian artery stenosis (SAS), caused by atherosclerotic occlusive plaques, is most often asymptomatic and does not require specific therapy, other than that directed at the underlying etiology [1]. The most important point on deciding the type of treatment is whether the patient has ischemic symptoms or is asymptomatic. Symptomatic cases are treated primarily with interventional modalities. Herein, we report a case of asymptomatic SAS discovered incidentally in a patient with coronary-artery bypass graft (CABG).A 79-year-old man who had undergone CABG 10 years earlier and had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia was admitted to the outpatient clinic with stable angina pectoris. Coronary angiography was performed via right femoral access and aortography was performed to localize venous bypass grafts. Angiography of the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was done through the left subclavian artery using JR4 (Medtronic Pro-Flo® 6F) diagnostic coronary catheter. At first, the left subclavian artery could not be traversed with the catheter, soft coronary J guidewire (0.014 inches), forming a loop at the proximal segment as if the artery was totally occluded. Administration of contrast agent revealed a web-like calcified lesion at the proximal segment of the artery, creating a firm line between the distal segments (Figure 1). The J wire was then exchanged for an exchange-length hydrophilic wire (0.014 inches) and the web-like calcified segment was passed allowing selective LIMA cannulation and TIMI 3 flow was detected with no flow reversal suggestive of coronary steel. Angiography was completed with full cannulation of all native and bypass graft arteries. The patient was then examined for SAS and had no symptoms of intermittent arm claudication, cold left upper limb, or systolic blood pressure difference between two arms. Computed tomography angiography confirmed a calcified plaque causing less than 20% stenosis at the proximal segment of the left subclavian artery and a kink formation just before the atherosclerotic plaque (Figure 2). It was recommended that the patient undergo aggressive atherosclerotic risk factors modification and regular follow-up.SAS is usually asymptomatic and is essentially related to atherosclerosis. Other etiologies such as traumatic or congenital causes and inflammatory diseases are rare [2]. It is recommended that symptomatic SAS be treated with endovascular stenting and angioplasty as first-line management. In cases where intervention is not suitable or is unsuccessful, open surgery is suggested [3]. The surgical treatment is either endarterectomy or carotid subclavian bypass, which both carry a low morbidity and mortality risk, although the risk is higher than in an endovascular approach.In patients with a history of CABG, coronary subclavian steal was reported as flow reversal in the internal mammary artery graft [4] and recurrent ischemia and even myocardial infarction have been reported [5]. Salman et al. have described a case series of SAS and different modalities of intervention [6]. Swaminathan et al. have described a case of SAS causing low flow state in brachiocephalic AVF that was treated with percutaneous intervention [7]. The most important point is whether the patient has symptoms: SAS due to flow reversal of the vertebral artery, ischemic symptoms such as pallor, pain, paraesthesia, and coldness of the arm, left upper limb claudication, pulse deficit, or neurological symptoms.Clinical examination and blood pressure difference between the two arms are important. Although the use of computed tomography angiogram is rapidly increasing, angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis. Saleem and Majdi have described a case where left SAS was diagnosed with echocardiography by recording a continuous flow with fast systolic and slow diastolic components at aortic arch-descending aorta junction [8].For the time being, not much is known about the progression of SAS, and investigation and invasive treatment are only recommended in symptomatic patients, whereas aggressive risk factor modification is recommended in asymptomatic patients [3], since it is known that SAS is highly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis [9]. This case highlights the importance of thorough investigation and combining information from multiple imaging modalities to secure the diagnosis and treatment plan.The authors declare that there are no competing interests.
Cardiogenic Shock due to Psychosis-Induced Inverted Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Bridged-to-Recovery with a Percutaneous Left Ventricular Assist Device
1Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine/Bayfront Health Medical Center, 625 Sixth Avenue South, Suite 430 St. Petersburg, FL 33703,  USA2Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Bayfront Health Medical Center, St. Petersburg, FL,  USA3Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine, Tampa, FL,  USAReceived 15 July 2016; Accepted 2 November 2016Academic Editor: Saadeh Al-JureidiniCopyright © 2016 Ravi Korabathina et al.

This report describes an acute psychiatric illness leading to the onset of this syndrome. The patient presented here developed cardiogenic shock but successfully recovered with the use of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device.Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC) has been characterized as a syndrome of transient left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction that occurs in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease and that is provoked by physical or emotional distress. The less common SIC variant of inverted Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (ITC) with its unique contractile pattern of basal and mid-LV wall akinesis but normal apical movement is increasingly becoming recognized. While its clinical presentation is typically nonthreatening, requiring only supportive care, there are rare instances of ITC presenting catastrophically with cardiogenic shock. Such a unique case and its successful treatment are described herein.A 51-year-old female, who is originally from Italy, presented to the Emergency Room (ER) 24 hours after landing in the United States with increasing psychosis. Her history was only remarkable for paranoid schizophrenia, but she was highly functional at baseline. As per her family, she was hearing command hallucinations which did not improve with her usual antipsychotic medications, aripiprazole and haloperidol. Her haloperidol dosing was actually being tapered over the previous 4 months. She had no history of drug or alcohol use.In addition to increasing psychomotor agitation, her only other complaints were profound weakness and dyspnea. Her initial vital signs revealed a systolic blood pressure of 70 mmHg, a heart rate of 118 beats per minute, and oxygen saturations via pulse oximetry of 78% on room air. The chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates concerning for congestive heart failure. She ultimately progressed to requiring mechanical ventilatory support and within the first few hours in the ER was necessitating escalating doses of 3 vasopressors. Her electrocardiogram showed precordial ST segment depressions (Figure 1), and the laboratory parameters were remarkable for an elevated troponin I of 14.7 ng/mL and elevated plasma brain natriuretic peptide of 1760 pg/mL. With a clinical diagnosis of worsening cardiogenic shock, she was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. The coronary arteries were noted to be patent, but left ventriculography revealed severe systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction approximated at 15–20%. The ventricular wall segment analysis revealed hyperdynamic apical wall contractility and akinesis of the basal and mid ventricular walls (Figure 2), a pattern consistent with an ITC. The LV end-diastolic pressure was elevated at 23 mmHg, and pulmonary artery catheter indices showed a low cardiac output of 1.7 L/min. Immediate echocardiography confirmed normal right ventricular size and systolic function, and there was no evidence of significant valvular disease or pericardial effusion.The decision was made to proceed with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support using an Impella 2.5 LP (Abiomed Inc., Danvers, MA) device. Over the ensuing 24 hours following Impella LVAD placement, phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin were all tapered off. Her hemodynamic indices showed steady improvement (Table 1), and the Impella LVAD was removed 60 hours following initial placement. Her native cardiac output 24 hours following device explantation had increased to 5.4 L/min. She was weaned from mechanical ventilatory support and extubated on her fifth day of hospitalization. On the same day, a contrast echocardiography showed normalization in LV systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55–60% (Figure 3). The previous akinesis involving the mid and basal ventricular wall segments was no longer present. A repeat chest X-ray showed significant clearing of the previously seen vascular congestion. She was started on a low dose of carvedilol and lisinopril and, after modification of psychotropic medications, was discharged on the seventh day of hospitalization without any evidence of psychosis and with near full baseline functionality. One year later, an email reply from the patient’s primary doctor in Italy communicated that she was still doing well with a follow-up echocardiogram showing stable cardiac function.Inverted Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been described as one of the 4 patterns of SIC, with the most predominant being the classical Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (CTC) with its characteristic LV apical-ballooning. With ITC, the pattern of contractile dysfunction is different from CTC and localized to the basal and mid-LV wall segments but the apical wall shows preserved contractility. Two case series, totaling 163 patients, have compared clinical features of ITC to CTC showing the former cohort as being comprised of younger individuals and universally having an identifiable stress trigger [1, 2]. Interestingly, the ITC subjects in these two series presented infrequently with cardiogenic shock when compared to CTC subjects.We present here an original case of ITC complicated by cardiogenic shock that was precipitated by worsening psychosis in an individual with schizophrenia who was suboptimally treated with antipsychotic medications. While the patient herein fell within the age group and gender predilection expected for the typical ITC subject, she also demonstrated unusual features. For one, mental illness exacerbation, as an emotional source of stress, is a unique addition to the list of primarily physical stressors that have been described to bring forth ITC, such as neurologic insult and post-surgical/procedural state [3, 4]. Emotional triggers arising from mental illness have been described to precipitate the more classic forms of SIC [5]. Secondly, ITC typically presents with stable hemodynamics and seldom with shock. In fact, there have only been 4 documented ITC cases in the literature demonstrating refractory cardiogenic shock necessitating the use of percutaneous mechanical support devices, and the triggers were all physical stressors [6–9]. An intra-aortic balloon pump was needed to stabilize two cases of ITC shock related to encephalitis and a dental procedure, and percutaneous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required for two other cases of ITC shock related to pheochromocytoma and iatrogenic epinephrine injection. The factors that led to hemodynamic instability in this limited number of ITC cases are unclear. While physical versus emotional stressors have been purported to confer added risk [10], the current case demonstrates the serious impact of even an emotional stressor, such as mental illness exacerbation, in bringing forth cardiogenic shock.While the specific pattern of SIC does not appear to carry prognostic implications, the in-hospital mortality for SIC is high at 8.7% based upon the largest case series of 208 patients [10]. In multivariate analysis, shock presentation carried a 3.7 times higher odds of mortality. The leading hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology of SIC is that a catecholamine surge occurs after a stressful event, and targets beta-adrenergic receptors resulting in a negative inotropic effect. There is variation in the density and distribution of these adrenoreceptors along the ventricular myocardium based upon age, and this accounts for the localized areas of myocardial stunning [11]. This explains the predominant occurrence of the ITC pattern in younger patients, as the density of adrenoreceptors is greatest at the basal and mid-LV wall segments in younger age groups. In the context of ITC shock, the use of certain vasoactive agents with their beta-receptor agonist properties is paradoxical and seemingly may worsen the hemodynamic condition. While there is limited evidence regarding the treatment approach to these critically ill patients, the earlier incorporation of mechanical LVADs into the treatment algorithm of ITC shock patients appears logical. To our knowledge, the efficacious and safe use of the percutaneous Impella continuous axial flow LVAD to bridge a critically ill ITC shock patient rapidly to complete recovery has not been previously reported.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Late Diagnosed Left Coronary to the Pulmonary Artery Large Fistulae: An Interesting and Incidental Cath Lab Finding
Vitta in Core Intervenções Cardiovasculares, Santa Casa de Araras, São Paulo, SP,  BrazilReceived 14 September 2016; Accepted 22 November 2016Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2016 Marcos Danillo P. Oliveira et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Coronary artery anomalies are congenital changes in their origin, course, and/or structure. Most of them are discovered as incidental findings during coronary angiographic studies or at autopsies. A coronary artery fistulae involve a communication between a coronary artery and a chamber of the heart or any segment of the systemic or pulmonary circulation. We present herein the case of a 67-year-old man with a recent history of exertional angina and dyspnea to usual daily activities whose coronary angiogram revealed an interesting and incidental coronary-pulmonary artery large fistulae.Coronary artery anomalies (CAA) are a diverse group of congenital disorders, and the pathophysiological mechanisms and manifestations are highly variable. Several controversies remain in terms of its incidence, classification, screening, heredity, and treatment [1–5].Coronary artery fistulas (CAF) are abnormal communications between a coronary artery and a cardiac chamber or a major vessel [6]. They may be congenital or acquired due to trauma or iatrogenic causes [7].Most of them are small, do not cause any symptoms, and are clinically undetectable. However, the larger CAF can cause coronary steal phenomenon, which leads to myocardial ischemia [8].We report the case of a 67-year-old man with a recent history of exertional angina and dyspnea to usual daily activities whose coronary angiogram revealed severe and complex coronary disease in association with interesting coronary-pulmonary artery large fistulae incidentally diagnosed during the same procedure.A 67-year-old man, active, Caucasian, presented with a three months’ history of exertional angina and dyspnea to usual daily activities. There were neither previous episodes of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary artery disease nor personal or familiar histories of sudden cardiac death. The resting electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm and left atrial and ventricular overload. The treadmill test showed an ischemic pattern and the coronary angiogram was, then, requested. The right coronary artery (RCA) showed a dominant pattern, with ectasias and diffuse discrete lesions and a moderate lesion at the proximal portion of the right posterolateral branch (Figure 1). The left coronary system, in turn, showed severe, calcified, and complex coronary artery disease: 50% at the shaft of the left main; diffuse narrowing lesions and subocclusion at the proximal portion of the left anterior descending; discrete lesions at the three diagonal branches; subocclusion at the ostium followed by total occlusion at the mid portion of the left circumflex, with a well developed collateral circulation from the RCA and discrete lesions at the first obtuse marginal branch (Figure 2). Surprisingly, a well developed fistula was found, from the left main and, especially, the first diagonal branch to the pulmonary artery (Figure 3). The left ventricle showed a hypertrophic pattern, with normal systolic function. There was no systolic aortic transvalvular gradient. Due to this association between severe and complex coronary artery disease and the large left coronary-pulmonary artery fistulae, the surgical intervention (bypass grafting plus ligation of the fistulae) was, then, proposed to the patient. He is, at the time of this report, waiting the call for the surgery, in the same functional status, without hospital readmissions or major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events.CAA are congenital changes in their origin, course, and/or structure. Several controversies remain in terms of its incidence, classification, screening, heredity, and treatment. Despite being mostly asymptomatic, clinical presentation in adults may result from myocardial ischemia, manifesting as angina, syncope, arrhythmias, and even sudden death. In young athletes, apparently healthy ones, they are the second most frequent cause of sudden death [1–5].Most CAA are discovered as incidental findings during coronary angiographic study or at autopsy with incidence rate of 0.64% to 1.3% reported in the literature [1, 5].CAF are abnormal communications between a coronary and a cardiac chamber or a major vessel [6]. They are usually congenital but may be consequent to trauma or iatrogenic causes [7].The majority of CAF are small, do not cause any symptoms or hemodynamic compromise, and are clinically undetectable until echocardiography or coronary angiography is performed. They usually do not cause any complications and can spontaneously resolve. However, larger fistulae are usually three times the normal caliber of a coronary artery and may cause complications and/or symptoms, especially due to the coronary steal phenomenon, which leads to myocardium ischemia of the territory perfused by the related coronary artery. The mechanism is related to the diastolic pressure gradient and runoff from the coronary vasculature to a low-pressure receiving cavity. If the fistula is large, the intracoronary diastolic perfusion pressure progressively diminishes [7, 9].Over time, the coronary artery leading to the fistulous tract progressively dilates, which, in turn, may progress to aneurysm formation, intimal ulceration or rupture, medial degeneration, atherosclerosis, calcification, mural thrombosis, and, rarely, rupture [7, 9].The hemodynamic significance of the fistulous connection depends on the size of the communication, the resistance of the recipient chamber, and the potential for development of myocardial ischemia. High-output congestive heart failure has been described [7, 9].Noninvasive 3D imaging of the coronary vasculature is advantageous. Traditionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been a good alternative for imaging proximal coronary abnormalities, and newer imaging sequences have provided improved anatomic imaging as well as indices of coronary flow and function. Spatial resolution is often limiting, and the distal course and insertion of the fistulous connection may not be well imaged. Multidetector computed tomographic angiography (MDCTA) has provided excellent distal coronary artery and side branch imaging, with better temporal and spatial resolution than MRI. Several authors recommend MDCTA in imaging of coronary anomalies [10]. A retrospective study by Lim et al. [11], including 6341 patients, suggested that MDCTA is useful in detecting CAF, found in 56 patients (0.9%), a higher percentage than that generally found using conventional angiography. Moreover, MDCTA found CAF to lead most commonly to the pulmonary artery [11].All interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons should be familiar with these anatomic variants since accurate recognition of the course and distribution of the coronary vessels are crucial for proper revascularization strategies in the presence of coronary artery disease [1, 5].In our case, since there was an association between significant and complex multiple coronary lesions and a larger CAF, the surgical correction of both problems was considered as the best treatment option for the patient.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Primary Cardiac Lymphoma: Lessons Learned from a Long Survivor

Patients with PCL have median survival of approximately 7 months. We report a 63-year-old woman with PCL treated with chemoimmunotherapy but relapsed 7 years later. She received automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) prophylactically shortly after the diagnosis. She presented with a breast recidive 7 years after initial diagnosis and died of relapsed small cell lung cancer. As many patients with PCL die early in the disease course due to life-threatening arrhythmias, preemptive implantation of AICD may improve mortality and prevent early death. Chemoimmunotherapy is effective in inducing remission in patients with PCL. Late and unusual pattern of relapse may be more frequent in patients with PCL and should be explored further. This case presents one of the longest surviving patients with PCL reported in the literature.Primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) that solely involves the heart, the pericardium, or both and accounts for less than 0.01% of all cardiac tumors [1–3]. The clinical presentation of PCL varies depending on the location, size, and degree of invasion [4]. The rising incidence of PCL is thought to be due to advances in diagnostic radiologic technology, greater exposure to environmental toxins, and a larger number of immunocompromised individuals [5]. Here, we present a case of PCL diagnosed intraoperatively and treated successfully with multiagent chemoimmunotherapy with subsequent relapse 7 years after initial diagnosis.A 63-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of atypical chest pain, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion. Physical examination was unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed Mobitz I second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. A large filling defect in the right atrium and right ventricle was seen on computed tomography (CT) angiography (Figure 1). Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed a 56 mm × 48 mm mobile mass arising from the intra-atrial septum, occupying the majority of the right atrial cavity and causing partial obstruction of the right ventricular outflow. Left ventricular (LV) systolic function was preserved with an ejection fraction of 65%. The patient underwent sternotomy with incisional biopsy of the cardiac mass. Pathological examination revealed large malignant lymphocytes expressing CD20, BCL-2, BCL-6, and MUM-1 but not c-myc or cyclin D1 (Figure 2). Ki-67 proliferative index was at 90%. These findings are consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). CT of the abdomen and pelvis and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy failed to show other areas of disease.A prophylactic automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) was implanted to prevent sudden cardiac death from cardiac arrhythmias, frequently reported in similar cases [5–8]. She developed a postoperative pulmonary embolism requiring anticoagulation. She achieved complete response (CR) with 6 cycles of chemoimmunotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP)). The patient remained stable for 6 years at which time she was diagnosed with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) which was treated with chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide resulting in CR and she went on to receive prophylactic cranial irradiation. One year later, she developed a 2 cm solitary right breast mass. Core biopsy revealed DLBCL with an immunophenotype similar to that seen in the original right atrial neoplastic cells except that expression of BCL-6 and MUM-1 was equivocal in the breast biopsy. The Ki-67 proliferative index was at 80%. As LV systolic function was preserved, she was retreated with R-CHOP for 3 cycles achieving CR as confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. Within 2 months, she developed a left pleural effusion, suspicious for recurrence of small cell lung cancer. Her condition deteriorated rapidly; she developed multiorgan failure and died 87 months after her initial diagnosis.PCL is a rare cardiac neoplasm with slight male predominance; median age is 63 at diagnosis [5]. It more frequently affects immunocompromised patients [5, 9, 10]. Involvement of the right side of the heart predominates; only 7% of PCL involves left cardiac chambers [5]. DLBCL is the most common pathological variant of PCL but Burkitt’s lymphoma, T-cell lymphomas, small lymphocytic lymphoma, and plasmablastic lymphoma also occur [5, 11]. The most common presenting symptoms are dyspnea followed by constitutional symptoms and chest pain [5]. Approximately 47% of patients with PCL present with congestive heart failure (CHF), which is frequently resistant to standard therapy [12].With advances in imaging modalities, PCL is being diagnosed more frequently antemortem [8, 11]. The most frequent ECG abnormalities include atrial arrhythmias and AV blocks; however, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias may occur [5, 8, 13, 14]. CT scans can be helpful in characterizing the extent of cardiac mass [10]. Sensitivity of MRI and TEE at detecting cardiac masses is reported to be greater than 90% but MRI is superior to TEE for detecting myocardial and pericardial thickening [3].18Fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) PET/CT scanning can be useful in detecting malignant cardiac masses and confirming cardiac isolation [15].Tissue diagnosis remains of paramount importance. Cytological examination of pleural or pericardial fluid, if present, can detect monoclonal lymphocytes. In a case series of 50 patients, cytological examination of pericardial effusion was diagnostic in 67% of cases [3]. However, some cases still need more invasive diagnostic procedures. Cardiac catheterization with echocardiography-guided transvenous biopsy may be considered when available [13, 16]. Sternotomy with excision of the tumor may be needed to relieve symptoms and obtain tissue for diagnosis [14, 17].There is no standardized therapy for PCL. Most anecdotal data suggest that since PCL is a systemic disease, therapy should be systemic as well [5]. Multiagent, anthracycline-based chemotherapy is the most widely used therapeutic modality but this can be challenging in patients with LV systolic dysfunction. Rituximab is frequently added due to its established efficacy in NHL [18]. In a small series of patients with PCL, the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy improved progression-free survival from 12 to 24 months [19]. Our patient received chemoimmunotherapy using R-CHOP, which successfully resulted in CR that lasted for 7 years. The role of surgery in PCL treatment is limited. Adding radiotherapy to chemotherapy appears to have limited impact on patient outcomes [5]. The risk of developing radiation-induced heart disease also makes this option less attractive [19, 20]. It is unlikely that adding radiotherapy would have prevented relapse in our patient as it occurred at a distant site.A few cases of early relapse have been described in the literature [5, 21]. Rarely, isolated extranodal and extracardiac relapse, for example, in the central nervous system, have been reported [21, 22]. Our patient relapsed after 7 years with an isolated breast lesion. The atypical timing and location of relapse we encountered in our patient and reported by others in the literature may suggest a more unique behavior of PCL, one that differs from what is encountered in noncardiac DLBCL, where late relapse is rare with an estimated frequency of 2.2% per year after 2 years of CR [23, 24]. Our patient developed a solid organ neoplasm that may be related to her lifelong tobacco use. However, a link between this diagnosis and PCL and/or its relapse may exist. The use of chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer may have suppressed the immune system allowing for recurrence of previously dormant PCL.The most common causes of death are intractable heart failure, sepsis, progression of lymphoma, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Arrhythmias are frequent, occur early in the course of the disease, and may contribute significantly to early death [5, 8, 17, 25]. Reports of AICD use in patients with PCL are scarce and usually follow development of life-threatening arrhythmias [26, 27]. Our patient preemptively received prophylactic AICD, which may explain her long survival of 87 months. The addition of rituximab to the chemotherapeutic regimen may also have contributed to the long survival in our patient. In our opinion, chemoimmunotherapy rather than chemotherapy should be the treatment of choice. Early implantation of prophylactic AICD should be considered in patients with PCL. Finally, clinicians should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism and anticoagulation therapy should be promptly initiated as soon as suspicion arises.PCL is a rare cardiac neoplasm. Our patient had a late relapse at an extranodal site, suggesting that PCL behavior may be unique and different from that of noncardiac DLBCL. We suggest the use of prophylactic AICD to prevent early deaths due to cardiac arrhythmias, which may be precipitated by the tumor, operative diagnostic procedures, or severe CHF.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Addison’s Disease and Dilated Cardiomyopathy: A Case Report and Review of the Literature

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Addison’s disease is often accompanied by a number of cardiovascular manifestations. We report the case of a 30-year-old man who presented with a new onset dilated cardiomyopathy due to Addison’s disease. The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes of this rare hormone mediated cardiac disorder are reviewed.Addison’s disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, is associated with a decreased production of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones from the adrenal cortex [1]. Although autoimmune adrenalitis is considered to be the major cause of Addison’s disease in up to 90% of diagnosed individuals, prevalent in female patients between 30 and 50 years of age, other etiologies include infectious, drug induced, and/or genetic factors [2, 3]. Common manifestations of this condition are hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and/or hypoglycemia along with mucosal and skin hyperpigmentations [2, 3]. Although cardiovascular manifestations of Addison’s disease include hypotension, syncope, and arrhythmias, the development of a dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure are an uncommon life-threatening complication [4–8]. We describe a rare case of a 30-year-old male with a dilated cardiomyopathy in the context of Addison’s disease and review all 6 adult cases of this cardiac manifestation published to date [4–8]. We evaluate the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes of these cases and discuss the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of this rare hormone mediated cardiac disorder.A 30-year-old previously healthy male presented to the emergency department with constitutional symptoms of weakness, fatigue, dizziness, and anorexia. A baseline EKG and chest X-ray were within normal limits. He was diagnosed with primary adrenal insufficiency presenting with biochemical evidence of high ACTH (>278 pmol/L) and low cortisol levels (32 nmol/L) and started on prednisone 5 mg po od and fludrocortisone 0.1 mg po od. Two weeks later, he presented with a 5-day history of orthopnea and increasing dyspnea on minimal exertion. On presentation, the blood pressure was 104/74 mm Hg with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. The jugular venous pressure was elevated at the angle of the jaw with displacement of the cardiac apex and normal heart sounds. There were diminished breath sounds bilaterally in both lower lung fields without evidence of peripheral edema. The serum sodium was mildly reduced at 132 mmol/L (normal range: 135–145 mmol/L) while the potassium was increased at 5.6 mmol/L (normal range: 3.5–5.0 mmol/L). There was a markedly elevated N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide of 4515 pg/mL (normal range <125 pg/mL), consistent with clinical and biochemical evidence of acute heart failure. The serum TSH, urine toxicology, and metanephrines were within normal limits. A 12-lead EKG demonstrated poor R-wave progression across the precordial leads with evidence of a left anterior fascicular block. Chest X-ray findings were consistent with bilateral pleural effusions, vascular redistribution, and interstitial edema. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) confirmed a dilated left ventricle (LV), severe LV systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 15%, and moderate functional mitral regurgitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement was normal with no evidence of a viral myocarditis nor infiltrative cardiomyopathy. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated normal coronaries consistent with the diagnosis of a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen revealed hyperdense adrenal glands with central necrotic areas of hypoattenuation and peripheral enhancement, consistent with the recent diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency. With a new diagnosis of acute heart failure due to primary Addison’s disease, the patient was admitted for medical treatment with parenteral diuretics, ACE inhibition, beta blockade, and a decrease in the fludrocortisone dosage (that was started 2 weeks before). A 6-month follow-up multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) revealed an improvement in LV ejection fraction to 40–45%.With an incidence of approximately 120 cases per million in the population, Addison’s disease is a rare long term endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce insufficient steroid hormones, including glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids [1–3, 9]. The clinical presentation of Addison’s disease encompasses a multitude of systemic symptoms including fatigue, weight loss, salt craving, and joint and back discomfort [1–3, 9]. Individuals with primary adrenal insufficiency may also experience a number of cardiovascular symptoms including hypotension, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure [4–8]. In fact, the development of a dilated cardiomyopathy due to Addison’s disease is extremely rare [4–8]. Although the exact etiology of heart failure due to Addison’s disease remains unknown, a number of potential mechanisms include (i) reduced effects of cortical hormones on the LV myocardium; (ii) poor alimentation with low glycogen reserves; (iii) hemoconcentration, low blood volume, and reduced coronary blood flow; and (iv) disturbances in electrolyte levels [9].After a systematic review of the literature of all adult cases of Addison’s disease and dilated cardiomyopathy, a total of 6 published cases (including the current report) were identified as shown in Table 1 [4–8]. The mean age was 38 years (range 21–53) with a male to female ratio of 2 : 1. Common cardiovascular features at presentation were hypotension, dyspnea, tachycardia, and pulmonary edema. Our case was unique in that the patient developed bilateral pleural effusions and the lowest LVEF as measured by TTE. Moreover, our case was only the second in which a patient developed symptoms of acute CHF following administration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the one with the shortest time lapse between the two events of only 6 days (Table 1) [4–8].In patients with Addison’s disease, dual HRT with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids is a necessity [1–3, 10]. Although oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone are the mainstay of treatment in this patient population [1–3, 10], the use of these medications may need to be altered in the setting of a concomitant heart failure crisis. In particular, fludrocortisone corrects hypotension by increasing sodium retention, thereby increasing systemic afterload. However, in the presence of a dilated cardiomyopathy and reduced LVEF, increased afterload by fludrocortisone may precipitate acute congestive heart failure [4–8]. In individuals with Addison’s disease who experience acute cardiovascular symptoms due to the development of a dilated cardiomyopathy, the dosage of fludrocortisone may need to be decreased or stopped altogether in order to correct the acute heart failure syndrome. In 4 of the 6 cases reviewed in Table 1, the patients were able to tolerate a carefully balanced dose of fludrocortisone after appropriate treatment of the underlying heart failure symptoms with medical therapy including diuretics, ACE inhibition, and beta blockade [4–8]. These agents, while appropriate for acute heart failure in the setting of a reduced LVEF, may interfere with the effectiveness of fludrocortisone in correcting hormonal deficiency, necessitating careful hemodynamic monitoring of the patient’s condition throughout the treatment period.A multidisciplinary approach must be sought in the management of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to Addison’s disease. HRT dosage should be optimized, heart failure therapy should be initiated, and patients should be closely monitored for future cardiovascular complications.No commercial relationship existed in the form of financial support or personal financial interest in relation to any part of the manuscript.
A Rare Case of Primary Meningococcal Myopericarditis in a 71-Year-Old Male

Woudstra et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We describe a case of primary meningococcal C pericarditis with myocardial involvement in a 71-year-old male that is thus far the oldest patient with isolated meningococcal pericardial disease and only the third patient with primary meningococcal myopericarditis described in English literature. Our patient was successfully treated by full sternotomy and surgical drainage combined with intravenous ceftriaxone. Mild symptoms unresponsive to anti-inflammatory treatment and leukocytosis may guide clinicians towards the correct diagnosis. It is important to recognize this cause of pericarditis as the relatively mild clinical presentation may rapidly progress into tamponade and right-sided heart failure.Acute pericarditis is a common disease with many possible causes. Idiopathic etiology, that is, viral or immune mediated, is the most common cause, at least in the developed countries. Since the introduction of antibiotics, bacteria are only rarely (<1% of all cases) the cause of pericarditis [1, 2], causing purulent pericardial effusion. In this report we describe a case of primary meningococcal myopericarditis (defined as pericarditis with myocardial involvement), which illustrates the importance of early recognition given the potential for rapid disease progression.A previously healthy 71-year-old male presented to the cardiac care unit with intermittent chest pain over the previous 24 hours and worsening of discomfort and pain by lying on his left side. Other symptoms consisted of pleuritic pain between the shoulders, a sore throat, and several days of low-grade fever. On presentation, he was not acutely ill despite a temperature of 38.8°C. Clinical examination of heart and lungs showed no abnormalities. He had one painfully enlarged lymph node on the right side of his neck. ECG showed sinus rhythm with normal axis and conduction times and widespread ST-elevation (Figure 1(a)). Laboratory findings showed troponin-T of 22 ng/l (normal value < 14 ng/l), CRP of 310 mg/l, and leukocytosis () with a left shift ( granulocytes). A chest X-ray showed no abnormalities.We diagnosed our patient with myopericarditis and based on the epidemiology we considered an idiopathic or reactive origin most likely. We hypothesized that a bacterial infection of the throat could explain the infectious parameters. A bacterial myopericarditis was also considered, but anticipated less likely given the absence of acute illness. With this differential diagnosis we took blood cultures and started treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (1000/200 mg 3 times daily) in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (600 mg 4 times daily) and pantoprazole.On the second day of admission, the ear, nose, and throat doctor was consulted, who excluded pharyngeal abscess as alternative cause for the elevated infectious parameters. A cardiac ultrasound study showed normal heart function and moderate (<20 mm) pericardial effusion (Figure 1(b)). During admission to our ward, chest pain remained unchanged and inflammatory parameters increased to CRP 495 mg/l and leukocytes of . On the third day, 2 blood cultures grew positive of Neisseria meningitidis serotype C (subtype P 1.5, 2, F3-3) sensitive for amoxicillin, rifampicin, and ceftriaxone, and antibiotics were switched to ceftriaxone (2 grams i.v. once daily). The patient’s wife was prophylactically treated with azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 3 days).On the fourth day, our patient had developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and ECG voltages were decreased compared to admission (Figure 2(a)). A repeat ultrasound showed a substantial increase in pericardial fluid to large (>20 mm) pericardial effusion, with dense structures within the fluid (Figure 2(b)). Furthermore, it showed diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis with a decreased ejection fraction of ±30%, a mild right ventricular diastolic collapse, and a fixed and unreactive inferior vena cava. Importantly, our patient had no fever and did not show other clinical signs of disease progression.By all means, the ECG and ultrasound studies clearly indicated early cardiac tamponade and our patient was immediately transferred to a tertiary referral hospital. Sufficient drainage via pericardiocentesis or a pericardial window was considered unlikely given the dense aspect of the pericardial effusion on echocardiography. Therefore, the patient immediately underwent complete pericardiotomy via sternotomy to remove all debris. Upon opening the pericardium, a typical bread and butter appearance was noted (Figure 3), after which 1100 milliliters of thick purulent fluid was removed and chest tubes were placed to drain the pericardial space. Gram stains were positive for gram-negative diplococcus. Cultures did not grow bacteria, presumably as a result of antibiotic treatment. The patient returned to our hospital after the removal of pericardial drains. Postoperatively he had signs of right-sided decompensation and persisting atrial fibrillation, for which he was treated with furosemide, metoprolol, and acenocoumarol. After completing two weeks of ceftriaxone, infectious parameters were normalized, ultrasound showed no return of pericardial effusion, and the patient was discharged in good health. After three months of follow-up, left ventricle ejection fraction was completely recovered and there were no signs of constrictive pericarditis.Meningococci account for approximately 6% of all cases of purulent pericarditis [3], being the fourth most common bacterial cause following staphylococci, pneumococci, and streptococci [4]. Meningococcal pericarditis can be classified into three types of disease: (1) pericarditis in disseminated meningococcal disease, (2) primary (isolated) meningococcal pericarditis, and (3) reactive meningococcal pericarditis, which causes serous and sterile pericardial effusion in the postinfectious course of meningococcal disease after successful treatment with antibiotics [5].Primary (isolated) meningococcal pericarditis (PMP) is defined as pericarditis with positive blood or pericardial fluid cultures without signs of meningeal involvement, meningococcemia, or involvement of other organs [5–7]. Approximately 30 cases of primary meningococcal pericarditis have been described in English literature, affecting mostly teenagers and young adults. Like our patient, they presented with chest pain, fever, leukocytosis, and a 2-day history of symptoms [6]. Only two cases of primary meningococcal myopericarditis have been reported [8, 9]. To the best of our knowledge, our patient is the oldest in whom isolated meningococcal pericardial disease has been described.A large proportion of the population is nasopharyngeal carrier of Neisseria meningitidis. Some hypothesize that a low-grade infection of the bloodstream brings the bacteria to the pericardium [5, 10]. The immune system effectively eliminates these bacteria from the bloodstream but is less effective in clearing the pericardial space. The sore throat of our patient may have been caused by pharyngitis (throat cultures were positive for Pantoea agglomerans), which could have eased the way for residing meningococci to enter the bloodstream. Blaser et al. [3] showed that meningococcus type C is the most common serotype causing PMP, accounting for up to 88% of all PMP cases. This is more than expected, since this serotype is less prevalent in meningitis and meningococcemia (22%).Like our patient, patients with PMP may not be severely ill on presentation [11]. This complicates differentiating PMP from viral pericarditis. This differentiation is important, because cardiac tamponade occurs in up to 88% of cases of PMP [6]. The lack of reaction to anti-inflammatory treatment combined with leukocytosis may point to PMP. Treatment of PMP consists of intravenous antibiotics, in most cases combined with drainage of the pericardial cavity [3]. Contrary to other causes of purulent pericarditis, PMP has good prognosis when timely diagnosed and treated. All patients previously described in English literature have survived [6, 8, 11].In conclusion, primary meningococcal pericarditis is a very rare disease, especially when there is myocardial involvement. It initially presents with symptoms similar to viral pericarditis but can rapidly progress into cardiac tamponade. Leukocytosis and no reaction to anti-inflammatory treatment should trigger clinicians to think of meningococcal and other bacterial forms of pericarditis.Informed consent was obtained from the patient.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests.The authors thank Dr. Cornelis P.

Inflammatory Pseudotumor Originating from the Right Ventricular Outflow Tract
Sect. of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030,  USAReceived 30 September 2016; Accepted 10 November 2016Academic Editor: Monvadi Barbara SrichaiCopyright © 2016 Mohita Singh et al.

Inflammatory pseudotumor is an uncommon entity, and its cardiac origin is exceedingly rare. Case History. A previously healthy 27-year-old man was found to have a systolic murmur during preemployment screening evaluation. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a 4 × 2.5 cm mass originating from the right ventricle (RV) outflow tract extending into the aortic root. A computed tomography guided biopsy confirmed an IgG4-related inflammatory pseudotumor. Patient was started on oral prednisone with subsequent reduction in mass size. Conclusion. Cardiac inflammatory pseudotumors are markedly rare tumors that should be considered in the differential of intracardiac tumors which otherwise includes cardiac fibromas, myxomas, and sarcomas. Inflammatory pseudotumor of cardiac origin is an exceedingly rare tumor but one that deserves to be included in the differential diagnosis for intracardiac tumors. There is a general lack of consensus on pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of these tumors given the paucity of literature on the topic. We describe a case of a previously healthy 27-year-old man who presented with a murmur detected on a preemployment physical screening found to have mass originating from the interventricular septum and extending into the aortic root. The location of the mass, specifically its proximity to the aorta, and its branches made the case a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge further complicated by lack of information available on inflammatory pseudotumors of cardiac origin. We report this case to add to the literature on this topic and contribute to the process of developing a consensus for prognosis and treatment.A 27-year-old male was found to have a systolic murmur during a preemployment screening evaluation. At baseline, patient was a healthy, active male who participated in team sports during high school without any cardiac symptoms. Examination revealed a heart rate of 60 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 131/77 mmHg, with prominent right ventricular heave, and a 5/6 harsh systolic murmur best heard on the left parasternal region, which increased in intensity with Valsalva maneuver without any respirophasic variation. There was no appreciable lymphadenopathy and no testicular masses palpated on exam. An Electrocardiogram (EKG) was revealing for normal sinus rhythm. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a 4 × 2.5 cm mass with wide base firmly attached to the right ventricle outflow tract (Figure 1). The RV systolic pressure was elevated at 64–69 mmHg. A chest computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of a large soft tissue mass possibly originating from the interventricular septum and extending to the aortic root. A CT guided needle biopsy was obtained with pathology consistent with IgG4-related inflammatory pseudotumor. Serum IgG4 levels were within normal limit and patient was started on 60 mg of prednisone daily. At three-month follow up patient had reduction in mass size as well as reduction in the systolic murmur from grade 5/6 to grade 3/6. The peak RV systolic pressure decreased from 64–69 mmHg at the time of diagnosis to 42–47 mmHg. Plan was to continue high dose steroids with serial imaging with transthoracic echocardiogram but unfortunately the patient was lost to follow-up after his 3-month follow-up [1].Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) is a rare benign condition that can mimic a malignant lesion. Most commonly reported in the lungs and orbit, IPT is an immunologic lesion usually in response to infection, necrosis, or neoplasm [2]. Cardiac involvement by IPT is a rare entity but has been reported in patients ranging from 5 weeks to 72 years of age.Given variability in the clinical manifestation and course of cardiac IPT no consensus on treatment has been formed. Surgical resection when technically feasible appears to be the treatment of choice. Reports of good outcome with both complete excision and subtotal excision suggest that rate of growth is unpredictable. Involvement of the vascular structures including the aorta in our patient made resection a near impossibility. A similar case report of inoperable cardiac inflammatory pseudotumor had spontaneous decrease in size by 40% over an 11-month period [3]. Two other reported cases [4] in children who presented with symptomatic murmurs were found to have plasma cell granulomas of cardiac origin and were subsequently treated with prednisone (2 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. In both of these cases, follow-up imaging revealed reduction in size at completion of therapy and at yearly visits thereafter.In conclusion, cardiac inflammatory pseudotumors are markedly rare tumors that should be considered in the differential of intracardiac tumors which otherwise includes cardiac fibromas, myxomas, and sarcomas. We hope to add to the sparse literature and contribute to coming up with a consensus on treatment on this rare phenomenon by reporting our case.The authors declare no conflict of interests.
Bradycardia Associated with Steroid Use for Laryngeal Edema in an Adult: A Case Report and Literature Review

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Steroids are used for specific indications in the perioperative period to reduce laryngeal or spinal cord edema, or for prophylaxis and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Given the other potential causes for hemodynamic alterations in the perioperative setting, it is important for physicians to be aware of cardiovascular side effects of short term steroids. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate, cardiac dysrhythmias, and even death have been described in patients receiving short term intravenous steroids. Bradycardia has been reported following short term methylprednisolone and dexamethasone therapy in both adult and pediatric patients. There are only two case reports in the literature of bradycardia following short term intravenous dexamethasone use in adult patients. This is the first case report that describes bradycardia following the use of dexamethasone in the postoperative setting for management of laryngeal edema in an adult. Telemetry and twelve lead electrocardiograms revealed sinus bradycardia and correlated directly with administration of dexamethasone in our patient. Bradycardia resolved following discontinuation of dexamethasone. We advocate for hemodynamic monitoring in patients receiving more than one dose of intravenous steroid therapy in the perioperative period, especially those with known cardiac and hepatic comorbidities and those taking medications with negative chronotropic effects.Short term steroids are used frequently for a variety of indications in the perioperative period. In patients undergoing elective spine surgery, steroids are used to reduce spinal cord edema [1]. In traumatic spinal cord injury, steroids have been shown to confer significant recovery of motor function [2]. Similarly in patients undergoing repair of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, intravenous steroids and CSF drainage are used as adjunctive measures to prevent spinal cord ischemia [3]. Following intubation, intravenous steroids are often administered to reduce laryngeal edema prior to extubation [4]. Dexamethasone is used for prophylaxis and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting [5].Given the frequent use of steroids and the other potential causes for hemodynamic alterations in the perioperative setting, it is important for physicians to be aware of cardiovascular side effects of short term steroids. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate, cardiac dysrhythmias, and even death have been described in patients receiving short term intravenous steroids [6–9]. Bradycardia has been reported following short term methylprednisolone therapy in both adult and pediatric patients [10–15]. To our knowledge there are only two case reports in the literature describing bradycardia following short term intravenous dexamethasone use in adult females. In both cases, bradycardia was self-limiting and resolved after steroid discontinuation [16, 17].This is the first case report describing bradycardia secondary to dexamethasone use for airway edema in an adult.The aim of this case report and literature review is to increase awareness of the adverse cardiovascular effects of short term intravenous steroids. Hemodynamic monitoring should be considered in patients receiving short term steroids, particularly those patients with coexisting cardiac and liver disease and those receiving other drugs with negative chronotropic effects.A 58-year-old male presented to the hospital with mesh infection at the site of a previous ventral hernia repair. Past medical history was significant for hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, type two diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity with body mass index (BMI) 48.8, and severe obstructive sleep apnea for which he utilized continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation. He had normal liver and kidney function. His physical status was determined to be 3 by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status classification system.He was taken to the operating room to undergo surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure involved explantation of infected abdominal wall mesh and excision of a sinus tract with small bowel resection and lysis of adhesions. Preinduction vitals were as follows: blood pressure of 137/81 mmHg, heart rate of 86 beats per minute (BPM), oxygen saturation of 95% on room air, and temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius. The surgery lasted 5 hours, with estimated blood loss of 150 mL and no intraoperative hemodynamic instability.Orotracheal intubation for surgery required several attempts. First attempt under direct laryngoscopy revealed a grade 3 view (Cormack-Lehane classification of laryngeal view). Second attempt with a fiber-optic device was aborted because of copious secretions and poor view. Third attempt was with a Glidescope, with grade 1 view of the vocal cords, resulting in successful intubation.Given the multiple attempts at intubation, there was concern for significant airway edema. In the setting of severe sleep apnea and morbid obesity, the decision was made to keep the patient intubated postoperatively. Because of fevers, thick secretions, and a low PaO2 : FiO2 ratio of 222, he remained intubated until postoperative day (POD) 3. Dexamethasone was started prior to extubation (10 mg intravenously every six hours) in anticipation of persistent airway edema.On POD 3, he was extubated following a successful pressure support trial. However, during the following thirty minutes, he demonstrated increased work of breathing with audible stridor. Noninvasive ventilation was attempted unsuccessfully, and he eventually required endotracheal intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Glidescope visualization during reintubation revealed a significantly swollen epiglottis and vocal cords. Otolaryngologists were consulted and the decision was made to continue dexamethasone to reduce laryngeal edema.Within twenty-four hours of the first dose of dexamethasone, telemetry demonstrated the patient’s heart rate dropping from 30 to 60 BPM. The patient was asymptomatic and the rhythm was sinus bradycardia, not associated with hypotension. Serial troponins and 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained and were negative for acute coronary syndrome. Other etiologies for bradycardia such as vasovagal reflex and electrolyte abnormalities were excluded. No other negative inotropic or chronotropic medications (such as beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone) were concomitantly administered.After a two-day course of dexamethasone, the patient was successfully extubated on POD 5. On POD 6, dexamethasone was discontinued. His heart rate returned to baseline by POD 7.On the night of POD 7, the patient was noncompliant with noninvasive ventilation (CPAP machine). He decompensated and was reintubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Arterial blood gas revealed respiratory acidosis (ABG: pH7.21/PCO2 100 mmHg/PO2 106 mmHg). He was in normal sinus rhythm with heart rates ranging from 60 to 80 BPM. Chest X-ray did not reveal pulmonary edema or infiltrate, but sputum cultures were positive for pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and he was treated with a course of nafcillin.On POD 9, the patient remained intubated and intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg every 6 hours) was restarted because of concern for laryngeal edema. This continued for fifteen doses over the next four days. On POD 10, sinus bradycardia became evident again, with heart rate of 30–50 BPM. All medications were examined for bradycardic effect and the only one identified to have the potential for negative chronotropy was propofol, which was discontinued. Midazolam was used instead (for sedation), while he remained on ventilator support.In spite of discontinuation of propofol, the bradycardia persisted and bigeminy developed on the night of POD 12. The lowest heart rate recorded was 31 BPM. Dexamethasone was discontinued on the morning of POD13 (last dose 06:00), with subsequent resolution of bradycardia within twelve hours. No other medication changes were made on that day.On POD 14, the patient went to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy and tracheostomy. He was eventually weaned to tracheostomy collar and ultimately discharged home on POD 28, clinically stable and ambulating with tracheostomy collar in place. For the remainder of his hospital course, his heart rate remained within normal limits, 70–80 BPM (see Table 1 and 12 lead EKG).Significant hemodynamic alterations secondary to short term steroids have been reported [18]. Bradycardia (defined as a heart rate less than 60 BPM) has been described with high-dose pulse methylprednisolone therapy used in autoimmune diseases [19]. It has also been described following short term oral prednisone use [20, 21].Cardiac arrhythmias as a result of dexamethasone use have been less frequently described and primarily involve pediatric patients [11, 22]. To our knowledge, there are only two case reports of dexamethasone-induced cardiac dysrhythmia in adult patients. One report described bradycardia in an adult female who received a 4 mg dose of intravenous dexamethasone upon induction of anesthesia for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting [16]. The other case report describes frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in an adult female receiving dexamethasone postoperatively following cardiopulmonary bypass for aortic and mitral valve replacement [17].This is the first case report describing sinus bradycardia in an adult male patient following dexamethasone use for laryngeal edema.The strong temporal relationship, including positive dechallenge and rechallenge, highly suggests dexamethasone as the etiology of the patient’s bradycardia. The Naranjo scale is a tool used to estimate the probability of an adverse drug event, with scores ranging from 0 to 13 and a higher score suggesting a stronger probability [23]. Using this scale, we calculated a score of 9, indicating a high probability of an adverse drug event (see Table 2).The mechanism of steroid-induced dysrhythmia is not known, but several hypotheses have been suggested. Steroids have intrinsic mineralocorticoid activity that can cause sodium retention and subsequent hypertension. Baroreceptor-mediated reflex bradycardia in response to hypertension is a potential explanation. However, although our patient had a history of hypertension, his blood pressure was not elevated during the postoperative period.Blunting of the chronotropic response to catecholamines is another potential mechanism of bradycardia development. In an animal model, Hall et al. showed depression of cardiovascular alpha and beta adrenergic receptor sensitivity with high-dose steroid therapy [24]. This theory is plausible in our patient, who was receiving high-dose dexamethasone at a rather short interval over several days.Steroids play a role in altering potassium flux across the cell membrane, and steroid-induced cardiac abnormalities may be a consequence of sudden changes in potassium flux across the cell membrane. Serum potassium levels and fractional excretion of potassium increased from baseline after treatment with pulse steroid therapy in a study by Fujimoto et al. Transient shifts in renal electrolyte excretion after intravenous methylprednisolone administration were proposed to cause shifts across myocardial cell membranes, causing cardiac dysrhythmias [25]. For these reasons, electrolyte monitoring during steroid treatment is prudent, especially in patients with cardiac and liver disease and those with compromised skin integrity who may be predisposed to electrolyte shifts, as in burns and dermatologic conditions (such as pemphigus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and erythroderma) [9].Transient, direct damage to the myocardium has also been suggested as a possible cause of steroid-induced cardiac dysrhythmias [15].The preparations with which the steroid injections are administered must also be considered. For example, phosphate buffered solutions may lead to formation of calcium phosphate complexes, causing sudden alterations in ionized calcium levels that may potentiate arrhythmias [17]. Our patient received dexamethasone sodium phosphate 4 mg/mL injection manufactured by Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC.Another consideration is the hepatic metabolism of dexamethasone. The liver is primarily responsible for metabolism of this drug to inactive metabolites which are then excreted in the urine. In patients with hepatic insufficiency, it has the potential to accumulate [26]. Dexamethasone is a long acting glucocorticoid, with a biological half-life of 36–54 hours. Despite normal liver function in our patient, the long biological half-life and frequent dosing of dexamethasone in our patient may have led to increasing plasma levels and subsequent bradycardia. The onset of action of dexamethasone is 8–24 hours, which is probably why the bradycardia did not manifest immediately after administration of the first dose of the drug [27].Finally, anaphylaxis to steroids may be a potential mechanism for adverse cardiovascular reactions [28], though one that is likely to be recognized immediately. Our patient did not exhibit any significant signs or symptoms to suggest anaphylaxis (i.e., urticaria, hypotension, or shock).Steroids are used frequently in surgical patients for indications such as upper airway edema and spinal cord edema. Given the other potential causes for hemodynamic alterations in the perioperative setting, it is important to be aware of all potential cardiovascular side effects of steroids, including bradycardia, a rare but potentially serious adverse effect.Specific treatment is not warranted in asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, as it is usually self-limiting and resolves after discontinuation of dexamethasone. However, there have been reports of cardiac dysrhythmias with hemodynamic instability and even death following short term intravenous steroid use.We advocate for consideration of hemodynamic monitoring in patients receiving more than one dose of intravenous steroid therapy in the perioperative setting. The need for monitoring should be determined based on the patient’s active and past medical problems, including cardiac and hepatic comorbidities, concomitant drug therapy (negative chronotropes), and any previous adverse reactions to steroids. When steroids are determined to be the implicating agent, the risks and benefits should be considered and when possible, this drug should be discontinued.The three authors (Preeti R.

Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for the Anomalous Left Coronary Artery Originating from the Noncoronary Cusp
1Department of Cardiology, Ashikaga Red Cross Hospital, Tochigi,  Japan2Department of Cardiology, Koga Hospital, Koga,  JapanReceived 2 August 2016; Accepted 6 November 2016Academic Editor: Konstantinos P. LetsasCopyright © 2016 Toshiki Kuno et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for anomalous left coronary artery (LCA) originating from the noncoronary cusp (NCC) is challenging, as it poses difficulties with the engagement of the guiding catheter and the establishment of backup support. This report examines the case of a 69-year-old woman with unstable angina of anomalous LCA origin. The computed tomography showed a diffuse plaque in the middle of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and an anomalous LCA originating from the NCC. After successful engagement of a straightened Judkins-Left diagnostic catheter, the angiography revealed a diffuse plaque in the middle of the LAD artery. We then engaged a Judkins-Right guiding catheter. Due to the weak backup support of the guiding catheter, we used another wire to stabilize it, and the stent was then implanted successfully. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of PCI for an anomalous LCA originating from the NCC. The anomalous origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) from the noncoronary cusp (NCC) is a rare congenital anomaly found in 0.008%–0.012% of coronary angiography cases [1, 2]. However, there have been few reports of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for anomalous LCAs originating from the NCC. Due to the difficulty in correctly engaging the guiding catheter and in gaining backup support, the performance of PCI for an anomalous LCA originating from the NCC is challenging. We report a case of unstable angina of anomalous LCA origin in which the patient underwent a successful PCI.A 69-year-old woman visited our hospital for chest pain at rest. She had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, and she had been smoking one pack of cigarettes per day. Her electrocardiogram did not show ischemic changes (Figure 1(a)), the transthoracic echocardiography revealed a normal systolic function, and her laboratory data (including the troponin T findings) were normal. Therefore, we ordered a coronary computed cosmography (CT). The CT showed a diffuse plaque in the middle of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery (Figures 2(a) and 2(b), red arrows) and an anomalous LCA originating from the NCC (Figures 2(c) and 2(d), red arrows). The patient was then admitted for a coronary angiography under suspicion of unstable angina. After her admission, we performed the coronary angiography by applying a 6-F sheath through a right trans-radial approach. Since we could not engage the 6-F Judkins-Left 3.5 Goodtec® (Goodman, Gifu, Japan) catheter smoothly because of the anomalous origin, we straightened it to engage it (Figure 3(a), Online Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/2097174). After the catheter was engaged, the coronary angiogram showed 90% stenosis in the middle of the LAD artery (Figure 3(b), red arrow, Online Video 2). For engagement of the guiding catheter, we first chose a 6-F Amplatz-Left 0.75 Profit® (Goodman) to gain backup support. However, we were unable to engage it (Figure 3(c), Online Video 3). We then engaged a 6-F Judkins-Right 4.0 Profit (Goodman) catheter and proceeded with the PCI. After the engagement, we inserted a guide wire, Balance® (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA), with a microcatheter, Mogule® (Goodman). However, due to the weak backup support, we could not proceed and advance the wire into the LAD artery. Therefore, we guided it to the left circumflex artery (LCX) with the Mogule. As we considered that we needed to enhance the backup support to the anomalous LCA, we replaced Balance with Grandslam® (Asahi Intec, Nagoya, Japan), which acted as an extra support wire. We then inserted the guiding catheter deeply and inserted Balance into the distal portion of the LAD artery (Figure 3(d), Online Video 4). We dilated the lesion with a 2.0 × 15 mm semicompliant balloon (Mini Trek® [Abbott Vascular]). After dilating the vessel, we delivered a 2.5 × 28 mm drug-eluting stent (Promus Element® [Boston Scientific, Boston, MA, USA]). Since the angiography showed that the stent was not entirely dilated, we dilated it with a 2.5 × 8 mm noncompliant balloon (Powered Lacrosse® [Goodman]). The patient’s final coronary angiogram revealed successful stenting in the mid-LAD artery (Figure 4(a), Online Video 5). The patient was discharged without electrocardiogram changes (Figure 1(b)) and was asymptomatic at the 2-year follow-up point.More recently, the patient developed chest pain. As the CT could not rule out stenosis of the stent’s proximal edge, we performed a coronary angiogram. Since the right radial artery had not been suitable for smooth engagement of the diagnostic catheters 2 years prior, we attempted an angiogram through the left radial artery. The angiogram performed with an Amplatz-Left 1.0 diagnostic catheter showed the patent stent and no new lesions (Figure 4(b)). The patient was asymptomatic at the 3-month follow-up point.The anomalous origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) from the noncoronary cusp (NCC) is a rare congenital anomaly found in 0.008%–0.012% of coronary angiography cases [1, 2]. Although reports of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for anomalous LCAs originating from the NCC are scarce, in our case, the performance of PCI for anomalous LCA originating from the NCC was challenging due to the difficulty in correctly engaging the guiding catheter and in gaining backup support. We were unable to engage an Amplatz-Left® 0.75 guiding catheter. Although an Ikari-Left® (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) catheter would have been a good option to consider, as it is sometimes suitable for PCIs for right coronary lesions, including in cases of high take-off ostium [3], we eventually performed the PCI with a Judkins-Right®. However, because of the noncoaxial guiding catheter, the backup support for delivery of the stent was insufficient. We inserted a Grandslam in the LCX for enhanced support. Although the Guideliner® (Lifeline, Tokyo, Japan) was not yet available at the time, the mother-child technique would have been a valid option for smooth delivery of the stent [4].After the follow-up period, the patient felt chest pain unrelated to in-stent restenosis. However, as in-stent restenosis could not be discarded without a coronary angiogram, we performed one by engaging an Amplatz-Left diagnostic catheter smoothly through the left radial artery. In this type of difficult case, a change in access route is an option for engagement of the catheter [5].We report a case of unstable angina of anomalous LCA origin in which the patient underwent successful PCI.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Acute Myocardial Infarction in a Patient with Two-Vessel Occlusion and a Large Lambl’s Excrescence
1Division of Cardiology, Mauriziano Hospital, Torino,  Italy2Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Mauriziano Hospital, Torino,  Italy3Unit of Pathology, Mauriziano Hospital, Torino,  ItalyReceived 29 August 2016; Revised 22 October 2016; Accepted 25 October 2016Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2016 Alfredo Pizzuti et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 59-year-old man underwent an echocardiography study after myocardial infarction and it showed a thin, mobile mass attached to the aortic valve. A diagnosis of Lambl’s excrescence (LE) was suspected. Coronary occlusion as a consequence of embolism of LE’s material could not be excluded and the patient underwent surgical excision. Histology confirmed the diagnosis; however a differential diagnosis with papillary fibroelastoma could not be established because both of these structures are histologically indistinguishable. A brief survey of the literature is presented. Evidence-based recommendations for treatment have not been established yet.Lambl’s excrescences (LE), described in 1856 [1], are thin, elongated, and hypermobile structures located at the coaptation point of cardiac valves’ leaflets. They are almost exclusively seen on the left-sided valves with a large predominance of the aortic valve [2, 3]. Their prevalence in normal population is quite variable, from 0,7% to 38% [2–5]. These figures are higher in patients with stroke (from 22,5% to 47% [2, 5–7]). These figures are not modified by gender or age [2].A 59-year-old man with hypertension and a negative history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events was admitted with symptoms of prolonged chest discomfort radiating to the left arm and sweating. The electrocardiogram showed mild ST-segment elevation in inferior leads and ST-segment depression in lateral leads (Figure 1). The cardiac troponin raised up to 3.75 μg/L (normal value < 0.015). The coronary angiography showed occlusions of the proximal right (Figure 2) and the proximal left circumflex (Figure 3) coronary arteries. Unfortunately, thromboaspiration was not performed and multiple bare metal stents were implanted. After coronary revascularisation the patient underwent echocardiographic evaluation. The exam showed a normal left ventricular morphology and function (left ventricular ejection fraction = 0.58), mild mitral regurgitation, and trivial insufficiency of a normally shaped aortic valve with a thin, mobile echo attached to its ventricular side. Because there were no clinical signs of infectious endocarditis, a preliminary diagnosis of LE was formulated. The patient was referred to our Echo Laboratory for transesophageal echocardiogram in order to define a possible embolic source. A 22 mm long, filiform, hyper-mobile linear structure arising from the line of closure of the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve and protruding through the valve during systole was identified (Figure 4, Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/8370212). This finding was consistent with the presence of a large LE.The hypothesis that the coronary occlusion was a consequence of embolism of LE’s material could not be excluded. The patient was offered either life-long anticoagulation or surgical removal. After consultation with our institution’s Heart Team (cardiologist, surgeon, and anesthesiologist) the patient decided to undergo cardiac surgery to remove the mass. The operation was performed in median sternotomy. A cardio pulmonary bypass (CPB) was established, the aorta was cross-clamped, and blood cardioplegia was infused. Access to aorta was made with standard transverse incision. The valve was exposed and the mass was easily removed from left aortic leaflet (Figure 5). Eventually, the aorta was closed. The cross-clamp time was 10 minutes and CPB time was 20 minutes. The procedure and postoperative recovery were uneventful.The histopathology (Figures 6–8) revealed a finger-like projection, similar to chordae tendinae, extending from the valve surface with a characteristic microscopic appearance: a matrix made of acellular collagen and a variable amount of elastic fibers with a surface covered by a single layer of endothelial cells.LE occur as singular or multiple strands and they are referred to as “giant” when multiple strands form a complex. In these cases LE should be differentiated from papillary fibroelastoma (PFE) (Table 1). Indeed, in the literature, a number of the cases are reported as giant LE and at the end appear to be PFE [8–11].The distinction between LE and PFE is controversial both macroscopically and microscopically. Whereas LE arise from the line of closure of valve leaflets, most often in the Arantius nodules [12], PFE are usually attached to the downstream side of the valve, arising from the midportion of valve leaflets. They break out into fronds-like projections and can also be found on other areas of endocardium. PFE are larger and more gelatinous than Lambl’s excrescences [13]. A typical aspect of both lesions, that is, a PFE attached by a thin, long pedicle to the line of closure of valve leaflets, has been seen in several cases [14]. Microscopically, LE and PFE are virtually identical; they both have a core of elastic connective tissue (fibrous body), surrounded by layers of fibrin and acid mucopolysaccharide matrix [15]. The classification of these two lesions may be artificial and based only on size and site [16]. According to some recent studies, LE and PFEs could be distinguished on the basis of the endothelial layers that are single in LE and multiple in PFE [17]. However, also this characteristic may be misleading, because a single layer of cells has also been described in PFE [15].Even if a consensus is reached regarding a conservative strategy for silent, asymptomatic lesions accidentally discovered, the evidence-based recommendations have not been established yet. Giant LE may have increased thromboembolic potential [18–20]. On the other hand, also a thin, elongated LE may have a thromboembolic potential. Both Aggarwal and Leavitt [21] and Wu and colleagues [22] described two cases of women with recurrent strokes and thromboembolic infarction, despite adequate anticoagulant therapy, who were founded with a filamentous LE measuring, respectively, 25 mm and 20 mm in length. However, the LE’s length reported in the literature is generally less than 20 mm, 4–16 mm in the old report of Roldan et al. [2] and  mm in the large (150 patients) series of Leitman et al. [3]. Nevertheless, the embolic risk could not be directly related to LE’s length, as we can read in Aziz and Baciewicz’s report about a woman with repeated strokes and thin LE (1–4 mm long) on all the 3 leaflets of the aortic valve [23]. In a recent study focused on patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Roldan and colleges reported that the LE’s length was similar in patients with ( mm) and without ( mm) cerebrovascular disease and in controls ( mm) [24].If the excrescence’s length does not appear to be a strong predictor of events, its mobility could be as follows; in a large analysis of 725 cases of PFE by Gowda and colleagues the only independent predictor of tumor-related death or nonfatal embolisation was tumor mobility [13].We found only one study that assessed the recurrence of stroke in presence of strands [4]; however all the patients included in this study were 60 or older, the strands were located only on the mitral valve, and the therapy was not randomized. Other information could be found in Homma and colleagues’ study [7]; they demonstrate that when a stroke patient is treated medically the recurrence of stroke or death is the same between those with or without strands and that there is no difference, in terms of efficacy, between aspirin or warfarin’s use. Unfortunately, because all the patients in those studies were medically treated, it was not possible to compare them with untreated patient, in order to assess the real efficacy of the treatment.Valve excrescences are quite common on the aortic valves of normal subjects and patients. They can appear in form of thin, single, and elongated structures (LE), multiple strands (giant LE), or flower-like excrescence with multiple papillary fronds attached to the endocardium by a pedicle (PFE). All these structures are histologically indistinguishable. The vast majority of them are found incidentally in asymptomatic patients, but the clinical course could be devastating for someone.Evidence-based recommendations for treatment have not been established yet. Symptomatic patients should be treated with surgical excision. If they are not suitable for surgery, they could be treated with long term anticoagulation. Asymptomatic patients could be switched to surgical approach, only if the lesion is mobile, because of the higher risk of death and nonfatal embolisation connected with the lesion mobility.The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Novel Use of an Orbital Atherectomy Device for In-Stent Restenosis: Lessons Learned
USD Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Sioux Falls, SD,  USAReceived 2 July 2016; Revised 28 September 2016; Accepted 23 October 2016Academic Editor: Antonio de Padua MansurCopyright © 2016 K. Shaikh et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We present a case of a 67-year-old man with stage III chronic kidney disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and high surgical risk who presented with two episodes of acute coronary syndrome attributed to in-stent restenosis (ISR) associated with heavily calcified lesions. In this case, we were able to improve luminal patency with orbital atherectomy system (OAS); however, withdrawal of the device resulted in a device/stent interaction, causing failure of the device. Given limitations in current evidence and therapies, managing ISR can be a technical and cognitive challenge. Balloon expansion of the affected region often provides unsatisfactory results, possibly related to significant calcium burden. OAS could be an efficacious way of reestablishing luminal patency in ISR lesions, as these lesions are often heavily calcified.ISR is a pathological development of neointimal hyperplasia resulting in the progressive loss of luminal area. Recent studies have suggested that early phase neointimal hypertrophy is in part due to calcification. These lesions are more robust and may contribute to stent under expansion if treated with balloon angioplasty alone [1, 2]. The management of ISR is complex, with a few treatment modalities recognized other than the balloon angioplasty and further stent placement. Unfortunately, implementation of these techniques can be ineffective in the presence of heavily calcified lesions. Calcified lesions are challenging as they can be associated with increased rates of stent restenosis due to being under expansion and poor apposition, which predispose to luminal loss and worse clinical outcome [1, 3]. OAS was recently introduced to the US market for the management of heavily calcified coronary lesions. Though recently approved, its five years of clinical use has been associated with a good safety profile and reasonable patency rates [4]. Previous rotational atherectomy devices, when used with adjuvant balloon angioplasty, have demonstrated safety and efficacy for the management of ISR occurring in femoral arteries [5]. However, the use of orbital or rotational atherectomy devices in the management of ISR remains off-label.A 67-year-old male with coronary artery disease, New York Heart Association Class III diastolic heart failure, paraplegia, diabetes mellitus, and stage III kidney disease presented with a high-risk, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure. The patient had presented six months earlier with an NSTEMI attributed to in-stent restenosis. Angiography at that time revealed calcified lesions, in addition to a 90% in-stent restenosis within the left anterior descending artery (LAD). These lesions were treated with primary balloon angioplasty and the placement of two drug-eluting stents within the culprit region of the LAD. The patient was subsequently discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy.His most recent presentation was characterized by features of NSTEMI including typical cardiac chest pain, elevated troponins, and worsening renal function. The patient initially received goal-directed medical therapy and was monitored for a few days until his renal function recovered enough to permit iodinated contrast administration. Subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed disease in the right coronary artery of 65% distal and 90% bifurcating lesions, 90% small circumflex, and 90% in-stent restenosis of the mid LAD (Figure 1(a)). Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for revascularization with coronary artery bypass. Due to multiple comorbidities, the patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate. The decision was thus made to treat the heavily calcified neointimal hyperplastic segment using the Diamond Back® orbital atherectomy system with adjuvant balloon angioplasty and stent placement.The percutaneous coronary intervention was performed using a 6-French guide catheter and the Diamond Back orbital atherectomy device (Figure 2(a)). The lesion was crossed using a hydrophilic workhorse wire and exchanged for the ViperWire® using a Corsair microcatheter exchange technique. The orbital atherectomy cutting head was advanced proximal to the area of in-stent restenosis contained within the confines of the stent (Figure 1(b)). The device was then activated and the head was successfully advanced across the stenotic segment on several passes. However, during retraction of the device from the proximal stented region, a radiopaque distortion of the device head was noted (Figure 1(c)) and the procedure was aborted (Figure 2(b)).After withdrawal of the device from the catheter system, it was observed that the orbital head was enveloped with wires that had been severed from the braided driveline. The procedure was further complicated by embolization into the femoral artery of the distal segment of the ViperWire (Figure 1(d)) that occurred during the wire exchange. Nonetheless, it did show widening of the lumen (Figure 1(e)).Over the past several years, innovations in interventional techniques and devices have afforded physicians the ability to address complex coronary interventions with improvements in clinical outcomes. Despite these advancements, highly calcified coronary lesions still remain a complex clinical entity that present challenges for current coronary devices and techniques. In addition to providing technical challenges, calcified lesions are associated with poorer clinical outcomes including increased frequency of myocardial infarction and in-stent restenosis, which are likely related to issues of poor stent expansion and wall approximation. Indeed, stent under expansion, asymmetric expansion, and stent malposition are frequently found in the intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) evaluations of heavily calcified plaques [3]. Indicators of angiographic success and presumptive benefit such as residual stenosis are worse in heavily calcified lesions compared to noncalcified plaques [1, 3, 6]. There are several cases reported that demonstrate early phase neointimal calcification in ISR lesions, which are more common in patient with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease [1, 2]. OAS was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of severely calcified de novo coronary lesions and it has exhibited encouraging outcomes and safety data [4]. This device uses a diamond-coated abrasive head that when rotating exerts a centrifugal force capable of pulverizing calcified deposits. The head is guided over a rigid proprietary wire and has the perceived advantage of cutting in either a forward or reverse direction. Use of OAS and stent placement in challenging calcified lesions were associated with lower major cardiovascular event (MACE) rates in the ORBIT I trial (12.1% at 6 months, 15.2% at 2 years, 18.2% at 3 years, and 21.2% at 5 years) as opposed to the Rotaxus trial MACE rate which was 24.9% at 9 months in treated complex calcified lesions [4].Use of OAS in the management of in-stent restenosis is off-label in the United States. To our knowledge, there are no studies or case reports documenting the use of OAS in ISR, although there is some data demonstrating both the safety and efficacy of a rotational atherectomy device used in infrainguinal ISR lesions [5].Use of the Jetstream® rotational atherectomy device in the infrainguinal vessels demonstrated favorable patency rates and was not associated with adverse outcomes, such as stent perforation or device/stent interactions [5]. To date, no randomized controlled trial has compared the OA versus RA. Although understanding the differential impact of OA and RA on patient outcomes awaits results of such a trial, early insights from plaque imaging following ablation suggest differences between the two techniques in their effects on calcified lesions. In a study of 20 consecutive patients with OCT imaging before and after OA () or RA (), OA was associated with deeper dissections, particularly in plaques composed of comparatively more lipid and less calcium. In this small study, there was also a signal toward improved stent expansion following OA; in comparison with RA-treated patients, OA-treated patients had a significantly lower incidence of stent strut malapposition (4 versus 8%, ). Whether this distinction will lead to long-term reductions in target lesion failure remains to be confirmed by a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Multicenter Prospective Study to Evaluate Outcomes of the Moderate to Severely Calcified Coronary Lesions (MACE) is needed, which will make available observational data about the real-world application, comparative safety, efficacy, and costs of different treatment strategies for de novo calcified lesions, including OA and RA [7, 8].The patient in our case represented a difficult situation because he had multiple medical ailments prohibiting surgical revascularization and had also endured a previous NSTEMI attributed to in-stent restenosis in a calcified artery. As he was a high surgical risk and rotational atherectomy has been proven efficacious in the treatment of infrainguinal ISR, OAS seemed to be a viable option. OAS did improve luminal patency; however, as noted, the procedure was prematurely aborted due to device failure attributed to stent/device interaction. The embolization of the distal end of the wire was likely related to a fracture of the wire occurring from initial device failure. It has been claimed that the device failure can be attributed to the orbital head skirting behind a stent strut (Figure 2(c)).This could suggest that the workhorse wire initially entered behind a strut with initial cannulation of the vessel. We suggest that using an IVUS with the workhorse wire would allow for visualization of the wire’s course and prevent inadvertent deflection of the wire behind the strut. Secondly, IVUS is considerably more accurate than angiography for coronary artery calcification location and permits accurate determination of the calcification burden and vascular dimension [2, 7, 8].The authors report no relationships that could be construed as competing interests.
Sinus Venosus Atrial Septal Defect Complicated by Eisenmenger Syndrome and the Role of Vasodilator Therapy
1Sanford Cardiovascular Institute, University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Sioux Falls, SD,  USA2Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Sioux Falls, SD,  USA3Department of Pediatrics, University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Sioux Falls, SD,  USA4Department of Radiology, University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Sioux Falls, SD,  USAReceived 30 July 2016; Revised 20 September 2016; Accepted 16 October 2016Academic Editor: Christopher S. SnyderCopyright © 2016 Amornpol Anuwatworn et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Sinus venosus atrial septal defect is a rare congenital, interatrial communication defect at the junction of the right atrium and the vena cava. It accounts for 5–10% of cases of all atrial septal defects. Due to the rare prevalence and anatomical complexity, diagnosing sinus venous atrial septal defects poses clinical challenges which may delay diagnosis and treatment. Advanced cardiac imaging studies are useful tools to diagnose this clinical entity and to delineate the anatomy and any associated communications. Surgical correction of the anomaly is the primary treatment. We discuss a 43-year-old Hispanic female patient who presented with dyspnea and hypoxia following a laparoscopic myomectomy. She had been diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy nine years ago at another hospital. Transesophageal echocardiography and computed tomographic angiography of the chest confirmed a diagnosis of sinus venosus atrial septal defect. She was also found to have pulmonary arterial hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome. During a hemodynamic study, she responded to vasodilator and she was treated with Ambrisentan and Tadalafil. After six months, her symptoms improved and her pulmonary arterial hypertension decreased. We also observed progressive reversal of the right-to-left shunt. This case illustrates the potential benefit of vasodilator therapy in reversing Eisenmenger physiology, which may lead to surgical repair of the atrial septal defect as the primary treatment.Sinus venosus atrial septal defect (SVASD) is one of the major categories of atrial septal defect (ASD). SVASD was first reported in 1858 and accounts for 5–10% of cases of ASD [1, 2]. It usually coexists with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR), which leads to additional left-to-right shunting. SVASD is generally unrecognized until the fifth decade of life when it presents as right heart failure and/or pulmonary hypertension [3]. SVASDs are usually located near the superior or inferior vena cava entry into the right atrium. This interatrial communication leads to volume overload, right-sided chamber dilation, and ultimately pulmonary hypertension [1, 3]. In this paper, we present a case of pulmonary artery hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome due to a superior form of SVASD. We will also discuss the beneficial role of vasodilator therapy in reversing the right-to-left shunt, which may stabilize a patient for future surgery.A 43-year-old Hispanic woman was transferred to our facility with hypoxia following laparoscopic hysteroscopy and myomectomy. She reported experiencing exertional dyspnea for four years. She also disclosed a history of cardiomegaly that was discovered on both a chest X-ray and through transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) nine years ago at another hospital, and she had been treated for postpartum cardiomyopathy. Physical examination revealed the following: heart rate, 90 beats/minute; blood pressure, 126/85 mmHg; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/minute; and oxygen saturation, 88% on 15 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. The patient had digital clubbing, right ventricular lift, and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the second left intercostal space.An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed right axis deviation, a right ventricular hypertrophy, and a left atrial enlargement. A chest X-ray showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and significantly enlarged pulmonary trunk and central pulmonary arteries (Figure 1). Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest was performed to rule out a pulmonary embolism in the emergency room. This study showed markedly enlarged central pulmonary arteries suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (Figure 2). In addition, the CTA showed cardiomegaly with marked right heart chamber enlargement, right ventricular wall hypertrophy, a large atrial septal defect (ASD), and right upper and middle lobe PAPVR (Figure 3). TTE displayed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, a severely dilated right atrium and ventricle, and moderate pulmonic and tricuspid regurgitation. The right ventricular systolic pressure was 67 mmHg. Notably, there was no interatrial shunt revealed by color Doppler. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed a moderately sized SVASD (Figure 4) and a bidirectional atrial shunt with saline contrast.In order to assess hemodynamics, a right heart catheterization was performed, which showed the mean pulmonary artery pressure to be 46 mmHg (normal value  mmHg). Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated at 11.1 Wood unitsm2 which is consistent with PAH (defined as a PVR > 3 Wood unitsm2). The ratio of the PVR to the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was elevated, at 0.6 : 1. The intracardiac shunting  was 1.1 : 1, which indicates left-to-right shunting. This ratio takes into consideration the left-to-right shunting from the anomalous pulmonary veins draining into the right atrium. This is demonstrated by the saturation step up between the high superior vena cava (SVC) (65%) and the right atrium (71%). However, shunting was right-to-left across the ASD, as demonstrated by a systemic oxygen saturation of 83%. These findings were consistent with Eisenmenger physiology. After administration of inhaled nitric oxide at 40 parts per million (40 ppm) and 100% FiO2, the patient’s pulmonary vascular bed was slightly responsive to vasodilation. The PVR decreased to 9 Wood unitsm2, and the ratio of PVR to SVR was 0.37 : 1. Although there was a slight improvement in the  to 1.44 : 1, right-to-left shunting across the ASD persisted. This was demonstrated by a low, systemic arterial oxygen partial pressure (paO2) of 165 mmHg, compared to a pulmonary venous pAO2 of 353 mmHg. In this case, CTA was initially performed to exclude pulmonary embolism in the ER. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was not performed since we obtained enough anatomical and hemodynamic information from CTA, TEE, and right heart catheterization. If CTA had not been done in the ER, then we would have done CMR because it is a better imaging modality to evaluate hemodynamics of the ASD.Based on the patient’s history, physical examination, EKG, and imaging findings, she was diagnosed with PAH and Eisenmenger syndrome secondary to a superior form of SVASD. Given her hemodynamic response to vasodilation therapy, she was treated with Ambrisentan and Tadalafil to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular volume overload and to reverse shunting. After treatment was initiated, the patient’s clinical symptoms improved. She was able to walk greater distances and climb stairs. Her SaO2 increased from 87% on room air to 92%. After one year of therapy, she was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for a hemodynamic assessment. At baseline, her right heart catheterization revealed a PVR of 6.6 Wood unitsm2, with a pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance () ratio of 0.61 and an overall  of 0.93 : 1. After administration of inhaled nitric oxide at 40 ppm and 100% FiO2, the PVR was 5 Wood unitsm2 with an  ratio of 0.37 : 1, and the  was 2.84 : 1. Overall, the PVR improved, and the  with vasodilation therapy favored a larger left-to-right shunt.SVASD is a rare congenital, interatrial communication at the junction of the right atrium and the superior vena cava entry (superior form) or inferior vena cava entry (inferior form). The superior SVASD comprises 5–10% of cases of ASD [1, 2]. The interatrial left-to-right shunting leads to right ventricular volume overload and increases in pulmonary blood flow and pulmonary vascular resistance [1, 3]. The left-to-right shunting is significant when the ratio of  is greater than 1.5 : 1, or when a patient develops dilation of the right heart chambers [2]. The right ventricular volume overload results in right ventricular dilation, pulmonary vascular modeling, pulmonary hypertension, and ultimately Eisenmenger physiology, which is an irreversible right-to-left shunt [3] as illustrated in this case.Due to its rarity, SVASD may go unnoticed and the diagnosis may be delayed. Up to 75% of patients with an uncorrected ASD present with dyspnea by the fifth decade of life [3]. In addition, atrial fibrillation or flutter, decompensated right heart failure, paradoxical embolus, and/or transient ischemic attack are associated with ASDs [2]. Unexplained dilation of the right atrium or right ventricle should prompt clinicians to do further evaluations for intracardiac shunts [1–3]. TTE is usually the first step in the workup for SVASD; however, only 12% of superior SVASDs can be visualized [3]. The diagnosis of SVASD is more challenging than other forms of ASDs due to its complex anatomy and may require advanced imaging such as TEE, magnetic resonance imaging or CTA [4]. TEE is more sensitive than TTE in visualizing SVASDs. TEE is also helpful in identifying PAPVR and assessing the size and position of an ASD [5]. Furthermore, the superior form of SVASD usually coexists with PAPVR and leads to additional left-to-right shunting [2]. SVASD is accompanied by PAPVR in 95–97% of patients [3]. The sensitivity of CTA of the chest in detecting PAPVR among patients with suspected SVASD is 100%, and specificity is also 100% [4].Surgical repair is only the treatment of choice for SVASD to prevent progressive right heart dysfunction [5]. Percutaneous closure is not feasible due to the inadequate tissue margins required to securely join the closure device in addition to the risk for systemic and pulmonary venous inflow obstruction [2, 3, 5]. According to the 2008 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, ASD closure is not recommended in patients with severe, irreversible PAH because of the risk of acute right heart failure after the closure [1, 3]. However, there has been a case reported of the successful closure of an ASD with irreversible PAH after a hemodynamic intracardiac shunt was reversed by vasodilator therapy [6]. Schwerzmann et al. reported the benefit of using intravenous prostacyclin to reduce PAH in a patient with a secundum ASD complicated by PAH and Eisenmenger physiology. After one year of intravenous prostacyclin treatment, pulmonary arterial pressure and PVR decreased and the patient underwent a successful percutaneous closure of the ASD. The patient was eventually weaned off of intravenous prostacyclin and continued to take oral Bosentan [6].In this case, Eisenmenger physiology resulted from untreated SVASD, not secundum ASD like in Schwerzmann et al.’s report. It is of paramount importance that clinicians consider ASD in the differential diagnoses of patients with chronic dyspnea on exertion, hypoxemia, enlarged right atrium, and enlarged right ventricles so the diagnosis can be made early and late complications can be prevented, such as Eisenmenger’s physiology in this case. In addition, our case demonstrates the favorable effect of vasodilator therapy in a SVASD patient with Eisenmenger syndrome. The patient was evaluated for surgery to make the SVASD smaller and to correct PAPVR. The intent was to decrease right ventricular volume overload but without complete closure so as to allow a pop-off valve in the event of right-to-left shunting.

Exercise-Stress Echocardiography Reveals Systolic Anterior Motion of the Mitral Valve as a Cause of Syncopes in a Cardiac Amyloidosis Patient
1Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus,  Denmark2Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus,  Denmark3Department of Pathology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus,  DenmarkReceived 12 July 2016; Accepted 18 October 2016Academic Editor: Hiroaki KitaokaCopyright © 2016 Tor Skibsted Clemmensen et al.

Therefore, a prophylactic pacemaker is often implanted. However, this case illustrates that other mechanisms should be ruled out prior to pacemaker implantation. The patient studied had mitral valve thickening without increased left ventricular outflow track (LVOT) velocity. However, bicycle exercise-stress test with simultaneous echocardiography revealed a stepwise decrease in blood pressure, a substantial increase in the LVOT velocity, and severe systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. The patients’ symptoms were likely explained by these findings. Therefore, a comprehensive clinical evaluation is warranted prior to pacemaker implantation in cardiac amyloidosis patients.A 71-year-old previous healthy man was referred to cardiac evaluation due to symptoms of dyspnea, orthostatic dizziness, and episodes of postural related syncope during a period of 2 months.Electrocardiogram revealed low-voltage limb leads and first degree of AV-block (Figure 1(a)). Echocardiogram revealed thickened left ventricle (LV) walls with a septal thickness of 18 mm and posterior wall of 16 mm (Figure 1(b)). The LV cavity was small with end-diastolic diameter of 34 mm and end-systolic diameter of 21 mm. The mitral valve was thickened and mild systolic anterior motion (SAM) was noted. However, left ventricular outflow track (LVOT) velocity was normal at 1.3 m/s both at rest and during the Valsalva maneuver. Ejection fraction was 70% but long-axis function severely reduced with global longitudinal strain at −10.1%. Apical sparing was noted. Coronary flow reserve was measured by Doppler echocardiography. CFR was severely reduced at 1.2 (normal range >2.5–4.5). Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) was suspected and the patient was referred for endomyocardial biopsy. This revealed extensive amyloid infiltration (Figure 2). Immunohistochemistry was positive for λ-light chains and negative for transthyretin, amyloid A, and κ-light chains.Pacemaker implantation was considered due to the previous syncopes and the findings of first degree of AV-block. However, we decided to evaluate the hemodynamics of the patient during a semisupine bicycle exercise-stress test with simultaneous echocardiography. At rest, blood pressure (BP) was 108/68 mmHg and heart rate (HR) was 90 beats/min. At 10 Watts BP was 98/61 mmHg, HR was 94 beats/min, and LVOT velocity was still normal at 1.5 m/s. At 30 Watts BP declined to 88/51 mmHg, HR was 98 beats/min, and LVOT velocity was between 2.0 and 3.5 m/s with a shark fin pattern. At peak exercise (40 Watts), BP was 74/45 mmHg and HR 106 beats/min. Severe SAM was noted at this point and the patients felt dizziness and dyspnea. The LVOT velocity was between 2.5 and 3.6 m/s (Figure 3).The present case illustrates that mitral leaflet SAM should be suspected in CA patients with dizziness and syncopes, especially if echocardiography shows involvement of both the myocardium and mitral valve. This is important as CA patients with syncopes traditionally receive prophylactic pacemaker implantation. Previous case reports have demonstrated obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract in CA patients [1–3]. The underlying mechanism of SAM in CA patients is unclear. It could involve a Venturi effect due to increased outlet tract flow mediated by increased septal thickness. This effect may be enlarged in CA patients due to the small LV cavities and increased heart rate. Furthermore, the amyloid deposit-induced increased leaflet thickness and papillary muscle displacement may also be involved. In the present case, symptoms and SAM were not present during resting conditions or during the Valsalva maneuver. However, we noted a stepwise drop in BP with the exercise induced SAM progression, which clearly illustrates the hemodynamic significance of the SAM. Therefore, exercise-stress echocardiography should be considered in the clinically evaluation of CA patients prior to prophylactic pacemaker implantation. Other causal symptom mechanisms such as conduction disturbances, ventricular arrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, or vasovagal effects could be involved in the present case. However, Holter monitoring revealed no arrhythmias and no pacemaker was implanted in the patient.Optimal treatment of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in CA patients is difficult. The risk of surgical myectomy or mitral valve plasty is considered to be significantly increased [3]. The effect of alcohol septal ablation in CA patients is unknown. However, the patient was found unlikely to benefit alcohol septal ablation due to the severely reduced CFR, the pronounced SAM, and the small LV cavity. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy patients often have near normal CFR [4] and slightly dilated LV cavity, which may be important for the effect of alcohol septal ablation. Disopyramide may reduce the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in CA patients, but the negative inotropic effect may lead to further decrease of long-axis function [3]. We initiated treatment with Midodrine 5 mg × 3 and Metoprolol-Succinate 25 mg × 1. Furthermore, Dexamethasone and Melphalan therapy was initiated with satisfying hematological response. At three weeks of control the patient described no further syncopes. However, he suffered continuously from dizziness. The long-term Midodrine and Metoprolol-Succinate effect on SAM in CA patients is unknown.In conclusion, mitral leaflet SAM should be ruled out prior to pacemaker implantation in CA patients. Furthermore, exercise-stress echocardiography may prove benefit in the clinical surveillance of CA patients.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Neurocardiogenic Syncope and Supraventricular Tachycardia in Association with a Rare Congenital Aortic Valve Abnormality
1Department of Internal Medicine/Pediatrics, Western Michigan University Homer Stryker School of Medicine, Kalamazoo, MI,  USA2Department of Cardiology, Michigan State University/Borgess Medical Center, Kalamazoo, MI,  USAReceived 14 June 2016; Accepted 10 October 2016Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2016 Yashwant Agrawal et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We report a case of a 26-year-old woman who presented with multiple episodes of syncope over a five-months period of time. Transthoracic echocardiogram had shown a normal functioning quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) which was also confirmed on a transesophageal echocardiogram. Computed tomographic angiography of heart and coronary arteries showed the QAV with equal size of all aortic cusps and normal coronary arteries. Intermittent chest pain and palpitations warranted an exercise stress test. The stress test revealed normal aerobic exertion, with achievement of 101% of maximal peak heart rate. However, during peak stress, we noted a drop in her blood pressure significantly resulting in dizziness. No arrhythmias were noted during the stress test. With recurrent syncope episodes and palpitations, Holter monitoring was done, revealing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). We discuss current available literature and coassociations with QAV. New association of QAV with SVT needs further analysis.A 26-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of syncope and palpitations occurring at her workplace, when she was lifting a 15-pound object. Syncopal episode was preceded by “color appearing abnormal,” as noted by coworker, and lasted approximately five minutes at which time she regained consciousness without a postictal state. Physical examination including orthostatic vitals was normal. Laboratory data and electrocardiogram (EKG) were unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a possible quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV). Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed a QAV without stenosis or regurgitation (Figure 1). No aortic wall or coronary artery abnormalities were detected. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the heart showed a QAV with equal size of all aortic cusps and normal coronary arteries including no congenital abnormalities related to their origin or in their anatomy (Figure 2). The QAV was felt to be a benign pathology, with no stenosis or regurgitation and patient was discharged. Patient presented to the ED 3 months later with multiple syncopal episodes, this time accompanied by sharp chest pain lasting for few seconds. Episodes were reportedly brought upon by physical activity. Physical examination and repeat laboratory data were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm. Exercise stress test revealed excellent aerobic capacity of 20 minutes. However, she felt dizzy at the peak effort and stress (stage 6), with blood pressure reading of 116/52, a significant drop from her initial reading of 155/72 mm Hg. Her heart increased from 166 bpm to 193 bpm. She was discharged with a 48-hour Holter monitor in place. Holter evaluation revealed a single episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), lasting 39 seconds at a rate of 155 beats per minute, though she was asymptomatic during this event. The SVT episode occurred in the morning when she was lying in bed. She was seen in the cardiology office and started on 25 mg atenolol for the SVT. On this treatment, she has done well, remaining asymptomatic without further syncopal episodes as noted at consistent outpatient follow-up visits. With patient’s resolution of symptoms, a head upright tilt table testing was not done but was considered. Also, firm diagnosis of SVT leading to patient’s syncope could not be made.QAV is a rare congenital aortic valve abnormality, the true incidence of which is not known. Most cases were previously identified on autopsies, with 0.008% incidence on 25,644 autopsy studies [1]. QAV has been subdivided into 7 groups based on size of the aortic leaflets. Majority are type A (4 equal cusps), B (3 equal cusps with 1 smaller cusp), or C (2 equal larger and 2 equal smaller cusps) [2].QAV mostly occurs as an isolated finding [1, 3]. Its association with other cardiac anomalies is of great importance (18.3%). An increased aberration of coronary arteries was seen in 10% of cases [4] who can present as sudden cardiac death. Our patient had an isolated QAV. The most frequently reported functional problem with a QAV is aortic insufficiency. It was described in 75% of the cases by Tutarel [4] and 56% of the cases by Janssens et al. [3]. A normal functioning QAV was seen in only 16–25% in these case studies.There has been one reported case of congenital complete heart block with QAV [5]. There are no other reported cases of arrhythmogenic activity in association with QAV. The symptoms resolved after the patient was started on metoprolol which corelates with her symptoms being most likely from SVT. However, QAV was functioning normally; hence there is a likelihood of the association between QAV and SVT being causal. The fact that the patient was lying in bed during the SVT recorded on Holter monitor explains her being asymptomatic during the episode. With no recommendation per valvular guidelines for monitoring QAV, physician awareness of associated anomalies and further evaluation of the same anomalies can be life-saving for patients. In-depth history and thorough physical examination with focus on development of new murmur can detect dysfunctional valve early.The authors have no competing interests to declare related to this article.
MELAS Syndrome with Cardiac Involvement: A Multimodality Imaging Approach

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 49-year-old man presented with chest pain, dyspnea, and lactic acidosis. Left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis were detected. The sequencing of mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) revealed the presence of A to G mtDNA point mutation at position 3243 (m.3243A>G) in  gene. Diagnosis of cardiac involvement in a patient with Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS) was made. Due to increased risk of sudden cardiac death, cardioverter defibrillator was implanted.Mitochondrial disease is a multisystem disorder with highly heterogeneous clinical pictures and can present at any age [1]. The disorder may affect virtually any organ and cause significant morbidity. The prevalence of mtDNA disease is estimated at 1 : 5000 individuals in Western populations, and 1 : 200 of healthy newborns harbour a potentially pathogenic mtDNA mutation [1]. The m.3243A>G mutation in the MTTL1 gene  is one of the commonest mtDNA mutations and can cause several clinical phenotypes including, such as in the presented case, Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS) [2–4]. Other common symptoms include seizures, cognitive impairment, muscle weakness and exercise intolerance, sensorineural hearing loss, cardiomyopathy, migraine, bowel dysmotility, and short stature [4]. According to a recent retrospective study, hearing loss and diabetes were the most frequent clinical features, followed by stroke-like episodes [4]. In this context, genetic counseling is an important component of patient diagnosis [4].A 49-year-old man presented at emergency room with severe chest pain, dyspnea, and metabolic decompensation with lactic acidosis. Personal medical history was also characterized by mild developmental delay, short stature, hearing loss, renal and glycometabolic failure, lactic acidosis, and a family history of sudden death in two maternal relatives. Serial Troponin I was elevated and reached a peak value of 6.8 ucg/L. Laboratory examinations revealed also a significantly increased BNP value (808 ng/L, normal value < 110 ng/L) and glucose level (852 mg/dL, normal value < 110 mg/dL) and a moderate increase in creatinine level (2.3 mg/dL, normal value < 1.3 mg/dL) and lactate value (2.2 mmol/L, normal value < 1.6 mmol/L). Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed short PR interval and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (Figure 1(a)). Echocardiogram showed concentric, nonobstructive LV hypertrophy (Figure 1(b)) with ejection fraction (EF) of 55%, mild aortic and mitral regurgitation, interatrial defect with left to right shunt, and restrictive filling pattern. Urgent cardiac-CT using a second-generation dual-source 128 slices CT scanner (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) revealed the presence of predominantly noncalcified atherosclerotic plaques without significant obstructive coronary stenosis and a severe concentric LV hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. The global LV myocardial mass was increased to 186 gr/m2 (reference range: 70–113 gr/m2) with a maximum wall thickness at the anterior basal wall of 20 mm. A small pericardial effusion and a mild hypertrophy of the right ventricle with a maximum wall thickness of 8 mm were demonstrated. After 8 minutes, a late-enhancement acquisition using the dual-energy technique (100/140 kV setting) was performed, showing multifocal areas of late-enhancement (Figures 2(a1)–2(a6) color-coded maps; and Figures 2(b1)–2(b6) merged gray-scale maps, arrows) with a nonischemic pattern (subepicardial and predominantly intramural). Considering the information obtained by clinical history, laboratory testing, and imaging, the patient underwent thorough genetic assessment due to a high index of suspicion for a mitochondrial disorder. A cerebral CT performed as part of the diagnostic work-up, showed atrophy of the cerebellar vermis, basal ganglia calcifications, and focal white matter hypodense lesions consistent with lacunar infarcts. A cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study was performed (1.5 T, Aera, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) after 2-week follow-up of supportive medical therapy showing multifocal areas of myocardial edema on T2-STIR images with a nonischemic distribution (Figures 2(c1)–2(c6), arrows) and a persistent but reduced LV hypertrophy, accounting for a global myocardial mass of 155 gr/m2 with a maximum wall thickness at the anterior basal wall of 15.5 mm; the global LV systolic function was still preserved. Multifocal patchy late-enhancement concerning the presence of nonischemic necrosis/fibrosis was demonstrated too (Figures 2(d1)–2(d6), arrows), which correlated with late-enhancement detected by Dual-Energy CT. 48-hour ECG monitoring was performed and neither atrial nor ventricular arrhythmia were detected. However, after considering the increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to the strong family history and the evidence of myocardial fibrosis, primary prophylaxis with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was performed. After a lengthy hospital stay with supportive care, the patient was later discharged from the hospital to home asymptomatic and without further complications. During hospitalization and at discharge, the patient did not present with any neurological disturbances requiring antiepileptic medications, antioxidants, and other cofactors [5]. The sequencing of the whole mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) revealed the presence of the A to G mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutation at position 3243 (m.3243A>G) in  gene (Figure 2(e), arrow), with variable mutant load in all the analyzed tissues (Figure 2(f)).Since muscle contraction and relaxation are active processes which involve energy metabolism and mitochondrial function, an impaired oxidative phosphorylation may in result in cardiac dysfunction. Although the evidence from literature is limited, a recent prospective study demonstrated the presence of LV hypertrophy assessed by echocardiography in 2 of 8 adult patients with MELAS syndrome [6]. Nevertheless, cardiac manifestation (arrhythmias, dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) was reported to occur in about 38% of patients with MELAS syndrome [7]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a comprehensive integrated imaging with both CT and MRI in a MELAS syndrome patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Importantly, cardiac-CT can be useful to exclude obstructive coronary artery disease in the acute evaluation of chest pain patients presenting with normal or low-positive troponin-elevation [8]. According to a recent study [9], the presence of a concentric hypertrophic remodelling pattern is frequently found in MELAS-like patients. Furthermore, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) at MRI, which reflects expansion of the myocardial interstitium caused by disperse interstitial fibrosis, partial myocardial disarray, and fibrous replacement of irreversibly injured myocytes, was present in 73% of patients (/11) with a diffuse, nonischemic (predominantly intramural), patchy pattern [9], such as in the presented case. Another interesting mechanism involved in the development of the LGE pattern observed in MELAS patients might be vessels leakage due to mitochondrial angiopathy, such as for stroke-like lesions [9]. The vasogenic effect translates into changes in microvascular permeability and extracellular edema formation that may in part contribute to the myocardial LGE [9]. That is in accordance with the presence of multifocal edema at the T2-STIR sequences [9]. In the current case, the reduction of myocardial mass of approximately 17% observed between cardiac-CT and cardiac-MRI was supposed to be related primarily to myocardial edema regression after supportive medical therapy, although different techniques and software applications between the two methods may in part explain that discrepancy.Myocardial viability imaging by delayed-enhancement Dual-Energy CT is a recently introduced and promising technique that takes advantage of the fact that iodine, the typically used contrast material in CT, shows similar washout kinetics of gadolinium and has a very unique dual-energy absorption characteristic at different X-ray spectra. In this way, by generating color-coded perfusion map of iodine distribution, it is possible to enhance contrast resolution of CT imaging to achieve a better detection of iodine concentration within myocardial fibrotic scar [10]. This has allowed imaging of infarcted myocardium with a high level of concordance between CT and MRI. Similarly to other genetic cardiomyopathies (including hypertrophic cardiomiopathy), LGE detection may play an additional prognostic role in the risk stratification of MELAS patients since LGE has been related to worsening of LV function and adverse outcome [9, 11].The current study highlights the importance of multimodality imaging with echocardiography, cardiac-CT, and cardiac-MRI if there is any suspicion of cardiac involvement associated with a rare neurometabolic disorder. In such cases, integrated information derived by CT and MRI regarding the presence and distribution of coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial edema, and late-enhancement may have important therapeutic and prognostic consequences.The authors have conformed to institutional ethical guidelines.Consent was obtained from the patient included in the case report.The authors report no financial relationships or competing interests regarding the content herein.Sara Seitun and Laura Massobrio equally contributed to the study.
Lyme Carditis: An Interesting Trip to Third-Degree Heart Block and Back
Department of Medicine, Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Pawtucket, RI,  USAReceived 23 July 2016; Revised 18 October 2016; Accepted 30 October 2016Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2016 Maxwell Eyram Afari et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Carditis is an uncommon presentation of the early disseminated phase of Lyme disease. We present the case of a young female who presented with erythema migrans and was found to have first-degree heart block which progressed to complete heart block within hours. After receiving ceftriaxone, there was complete resolution of the heart block in sequential fashion. Our case illustrates the importance of early recognition and anticipation of progressive cardiac conduction abnormalities in patients presenting with Lyme disease.Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the United States and Europe. Lyme disease is transmitted by the Ixodes tick (scapularis and pacificus in North America, persulcatus in Asia, and ricinus in Europe). The disease is mostly commonly caused by Borrelia burgdorferi in North America and by Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Borrelia garinii in Europe and Asia. Lyme disease can evolve into a multisystemic disease and its clinical presentation can vary widely. The clinical spectrum of Lyme disease is classified into (1) early localized phase (days to weeks after the tick bite, presenting with erythema migrans and a nonspecific viral syndrome), (2) early disseminated phase (weeks to months after the tick bite, presenting with cardiac and/or neurologic manifestations), and (3) late phase (months to years after the erythema migrans, accompanied by arthritis and/or neurological symptoms such as headache and lymphocytic meningitis).We present the case of a thirty-three-year-old woman with no significant past medical history, who presented to the Emergency Department during the summer reporting a three-day history of intermittent, dull, moderate-intensity chest discomfort. Review of systems was remarkable for shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Three weeks earlier, she had presented to the same Emergency Department complaining of photophobia, headache, and fever (101.4°F). A lumbar puncture at that time was unremarkable. Travel history was remarkable for hiking in the mountains of New Hampshire a month prior to presentation.Initial physical evaluation revealed blood pressure of 112/68 mmHg, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and temperature of 99.0°F. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable. The skin exam revealed a 5 cm erythematous macular rash with central clearing on the posterior aspect of the neck (Figure 1). Chest radiograph and laboratory tests, including cardiac enzymes (Troponin I: 0.01 (reference < 0.04)), were unrevealing. An initial electrocardiogram showed a first-degree AV block with PR interval of 320 milliseconds (Figure 2). A presumptive diagnosis of early disseminated phase of Lyme disease was made, and the patient was admitted to the cardiac telemetry floor. Several hours after admission, telemetry monitoring revealed second-degree (Mobitz Type 1) AV block as shown in Figure 3. Shortly thereafter, complete heart block was noted (Figure 4), with no additional clinical or hemodynamic changes. Simultaneously it was noted that due to a sign-out error, the patient had not received the first dose of ceftriaxone, which was then promptly administered.After receiving three doses of ceftriaxone, the repeat EKG showed regression of the complete heart block back to Mobitz Type 1 AV block and then first-degree AV block [i.e., exact reverse sequence]. Her echocardiogram revealed no structural abnormalities. She was diagnosed with Lyme disease based on the presence of erythema migrans and Borrelia antibodies demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western immunoblot findings (IgG bands: 28, 30, 39, 41, 45, and 58 and IgM: 39 and 41). Serology testing for Babesiosis and Ehrlichiosis, concomitant infections occasionally reported with acute Lyme disease, was negative. The patient was discharged home four days after admission to complete a 21-day course of once daily intravenous ceftriaxone therapy. One month later when the patient was seen in an outpatient cardiology clinic for follow-up, she was asymptomatic and her electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm.Lyme carditis is an uncommon presentation of early disseminated Lyme disease and occurs during the early disseminated phase of this condition. Steere et al. were the first to publish a case series on this clinical entity in 1980 [1]. Although Lyme carditis can manifest as myocarditis, pericarditis, and/or left ventricular dysfunction, its most common presentation is an electrical conduction disorder [1]. The most common symptoms of Lyme carditis include chest pain, palpitation, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Rarely, syncope and sudden cardiac death have also been reported. In the case series by Steere et al., PR interval >300 milliseconds was associated with progression of AV block [1]. In Lyme carditis, the conduction abnormality is commonly supra-Hisian, typically in the AV node. There have been rare reports of an infra-Hisian involvement indicated by QRS widening. Some other rare conduction abnormalities reported include QT prolongation, alternating bundle branch block, and ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.By far the most common conduction disorder involves the atrioventricular (AV) node, causing various AV blocks from first degree to complete heart block. In a review of over 100 cases, van der Linde reported that approximately 12% of cases presented with first-degree AV block, 16% as second-degree AV block, and 49% as third-degree heart block [2]. The rest of the cohort (23%) did not have any conduction abnormalities. The worsening of the degree of AV block may occur within minutes as demonstrated in our case. In the review by van der Linde, 35% of the cohort had required temporary pacing, and only 5.7% required a permanent pacemaker of which only one patient remained pacer dependent. Lyme carditis is a reversible disorder and in the vast majority of cases a permanent pacemaker is not required. In a systematic review of Lyme carditis associated third-degree heart block permanent pacemaker was required in only two (4.4%) out of forty-five cases [3].It is believed that, at the early disseminated stage of Lyme disease, the spirochete spreads hematogenously to the targeted organ systems. Spirochetes have been isolated in the heart tissue from patients with myocarditis and pancarditis at autopsy [4]. It is suspected that the immunological inflammatory response to the spirochete in the cardiac layer and electrical system explains the AV conduction disorders. Animal models have gone a long way to elucidate the pathophysiology of Lyme carditis. Monocyte and macrophages are the main inflammatory cells in Lyme carditis [5]. They increase the expression of the chemoattractant protein 1 RNA which appears to increase the severity of Lyme carditis [6]. In mice, infection is shown to upregulate the proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β and TNF-α. They are detected as early as 3 days after infection, with TNF-γ persisting for at least 42 days [7]. Experimentally it has also been shown that, through immunologic mimicry, IgM antibodies against the spirochetes may cross-react with heart tissues causing inflammatory response [8]. A previous report demonstrated a late gadolinium enhancement consistent with focal myocarditis in the atrioventricular region of a patient with Lyme carditis [9].Our case highlights how rapidly the conduction disorder in Lyme carditis can fluctuate; thus it is very important that patients carrying this diagnosis are admitted to the telemetry unit. Lyme carditis can be self-limited; however, antibiotics are required to shorten the disease course and minimize cardiovascular complications. Mild Lyme carditis (first-degree AV block, PR interval < 300 ms) can be treated with doxycycline or amoxicillin, while advanced conduction abnormalities (high grade AV block, PR > 300 mSec) as diagnosed in our patient necessitate treatment with ceftriaxone or Penicillin G. The choice of ceftriaxone in our patient was due to her presentation with active symptoms along with advanced heart block.Our case highlights the importance of considering Lyme disease as an etiology of acute AV nodal conduction disorders in patients who present with cardiac symptoms. This case highlights the importance of taking a good travel history and emphasizes the importance of appropriate and timely therapy to prevent unnecessary interventions such as permanent pacemaker insertion.Written informed consent for the publication of this paper has been obtained and is available on request.

Surviving All Odds: A Unique Case of Multiple Congenital Unruptured Sinus of Valsalva Aneurysms Involving Both Left and Right Coronary Sinuses with Biventricular Dysfunction and Heart Block
Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University, Kochi,  IndiaReceived 16 August 2016; Accepted 13 October 2016Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2016 Aniketh Vijay B et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Aneurysms of the sinus of Valsalva are very uncommon, with an incidence ranging from 0.1 to 3.5% of all congenital heart defects. Very few cases have been reported in the literature that presented with involvement of two or more sinuses. We report a case of 27-year-old male with a history of exertional breathlessness of one-month duration. After complete evaluation using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and multiple detector computed tomography (MDCT) scanning, the patient was diagnosed to have large congenital unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysms involving both left and right coronary sinuses with extension into the interventricular septum. The patient also displayed second-degree heart block (Mobitz type 2) and biventricular dysfunction. The patient was managed successfully. We present the case with an aim to highlight the management challenges including intraoperative and postoperative complications that are associated with unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysms of ≥2 sinuses.Aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva is a rare congenital anomaly [1]. Further, the aneurysms of the sinus of Valsalva rarely present with symptoms unless rupture occurs [2]. We describe a symptomatic case of multiple unruptured aneurysms of sinus of Valsalva, involving right and left aortic sinuses, with extensive dissection into the interventricular septum.A 27-year-old male with moderate build (body mass index: 20 kg/m2) presented to our outpatient department with a history of exertional dyspnea (class I) of one-month duration with no history of associated chest pain or orthopnea. He was apparently normal otherwise. Elsewhere, he was evaluated by a cardiologist. His echocardiogram had revealed dilated aorta, left ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was referred to our hospital for complete evaluation and management.At the time of presentation, the patient had a pulse rate of 80 bpm and the blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg. Clinical examination revealed left ventricular apex, physiological splitting of S2, and ejection systolic murmur of grade 3/6 in the left upper sternal border. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed, which showed right bundle branch block with first-degree heart block. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly. Subsequent examination with 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed diverticular formation from both left and right aortic sinuses. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) further confirmed the findings of diverticular formation from both left and right aortic sinuses (Figure 1). It also revealed that the diverticulum from the right sinus extended into the interventricular septum. Further, aortic regurgitation of mild-to-moderate severity was noted due to the prolapse of left cusp into the left aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva (Figure 2). Biventricular dysfunction was present and aneurysm arising from the left aortic sinus contained a large layered thrombus, causing right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction (RVOT gradient: 30 mmHg) (Figure 3). For further confirmation, multiple detector computed tomography (MDCT) scanning was performed (Figures 4 and 5), which revealed a diverticulum on both right and left coronary sinuses: a bilobed diverticulum from the left sinus with a maximum diameter of 5.4 × 5.7 cm was directed inferiorly and to left side (Figure 6), while a 4.6 × 2.7 cm right diverticulum from the right sinus was bulging into the interventricular septum and was directed anteroinferiorly (Figure 6). Further, the right coronary artery was seen arising on the side of the right diverticulum, while left coronary artery was seen arising from the roof of left diverticulum (Figure 7). Holter monitoring revealed an intermittent second-degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz type 2). Subsequently, all the acquired causes of sinus of Valsalva aneurysms were ruled out by necessary investigations.Patient was planned for Bentall procedure and permanent pacemaker implantation. Intraoperative aortotomy was performed, following which there was dissection around root, leading to injury in the ostium segment of right coronary artery (RCA) and narrowing of the ostium segment of left main coronary artery. Hence, CABG was decided. The aortic root was replaced with a 23 mm St. Jude medical mechanical valve conduit. Later, CABG was performed for left anterior descending (LAD) artery, obtuse marginal artery, and distal RCA from reversed saphenous vein grafts. Postoperatively, the patient developed congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram displayed a large pericardial effusion which was drained by left lateral thoracotomy. After three days, a permanent pacemaker (St. Jude Medical) was implanted for second-degree atrioventricular block. Patient’s condition improved subsequently and he was discharged after 2 days after an uneventful hospital stay. At follow-up after about 8 months, the patient remained asymptomatic and was leading a regular healthy life. Repeated TTE revealed a significant improvement in the biventricular function and significant reduction in the RVOT gradient.Sinus of Valsalva aneurysms is extremely rare, accounting for about 0.1% to 3.5% of all the congenital heart defects [1]. Among the sinuses usually involved, it has been estimated that involvement of right coronary sinus is the most frequent, followed by noncoronary sinus, while left coronary sinus involvement is the rarest of all [3]. Further, the cases of multiple aneurysms of sinus of Valsalva are very rare. Here, we present a case of multiple aneurysms of sinus of Valsalva with involvement of left coronary sinus along with right coronary sinus.In general, patients with unruptured aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva are usually asymptomatic until a rupture occurs into one of the heart chambers, leading to overt heart failure. Such patients with unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm are usually diagnosed incidentally during routine echocardiography. However, there have been very few reports which describe a presentation of symptomatic patients with unruptured aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva [2]. Conversely, the patient in the present case presented with class I exertional dyspnea with no history of associated chest pain. He also exhibited pulmonary hypertension, biventricular dysfunction, second-degree heart block, mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, right bundle branch block, thrombus within an aneurysmal sac, and RVOT obstruction.In general, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography is adequate to diagnose unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysms [2]. In addition to this, we used MDCT scanning to further confirm the diagnosis and to characterize the precise size of the aneurysms in three dimensions. We ruled out all the acquired causes of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (i.e., atherosclerotic, infective, medial cystic necrosis, connective tissue disorders, or trauma) [4] by doing the necessary investigations in the present case.The management of unruptured aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva generally involves surgical repair [2]. In the present case, the patient underwent Bentall procedure. However, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed as a result of an intraoperative complication including injury in the ostium RCA, narrowing of ostium left main coronary artery, and pericardial effusion, which were managed successfully. Subsequently, a permanent pacemaker was implanted. After procedure, the condition of the patient improved significantly and he remained asymptomatic on 8-month follow-up.We suggest fellow interventional cardiologists that appropriate prophylactic surgical treatment of the aneurysm may help in preventing intraoperative or postoperative complications.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.

Venous thromboembolic disease is a common complication found in 8% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The location at the right atrium is exceptional. These last fifty years, only 6 cases of thrombosis of the atrium in the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia were published on PubMed search engine. Case Presentation. 35-year-old farmer, who had been admitted by emergency department for superior vena cava syndrome and had a hyperleukocytic AML with complex karyotype associated with a significant thrombosis of the right atrium, extended all along the superior vena cava. He has been treated by the 2011 AML protocol using low molecular weight heparin and died from respiratory distress. Conclusions. If thrombosis is common in AML, the location in right atrium is rare. Its management requires surgery that is sometimes difficult to achieve.Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent complication found in approximately 11% of patients with acute leukemia [1]. It is associated in 13.5% with the presence of a central venous catheter, or the steroids use, asparagine in acute lymphoblastic leukemia or inherited thrombophilic abnormalities [2]. It is found in approximately 8% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [1] and sits in 73.3% of cases in the deep veins of the upper limbs: axillary vein under subclavian and jugular veins and 16% in the deep veins of the lower limbs: femoral vein, superficial femoral, popliteal, and iliac veins [3]. Pulmonary embolism represents 7.8% of the locations and is potentially fatal [3]. Intracardiac thrombosis localizations in AML are rare and scarcely reported in the literature.Using keywords thrombosis, atrium, and leukemia for research on PubMed there are only 6 cases of thrombosis of the right atrium which were published in the last fifty years.We report a rare case of a AML revealed by a superior vena cava syndrome secondary to thrombosis of the right atrium extended all along the superior vena cava.35-year-old man, active farmer, without past medical history, had been admitted to emergency department for superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS). Complete blood count (CBC) had revealed hyperleukocytosis with peripheral blasts, white blood cell count: 116 G/L with 95% blasts and platelets 212 G/L, and hemoglobin rate: 13.1 g/dL. Chest X-ray had revealed a pleural effusion syndrome of mean volume at left side and of great abundance at right side, with a right basal pulmonary condensation syndrome. He had been sent to the clinical hematology unit for treatment. The anamnesis revealed that the symptoms had begun 10 days before the admission by gradual swelling of the neck extended to the face with dyspnea all occurring in a context of impaired general condition. Physical examination revealed an altered condition with WHO: 3, temperature: 37° 5C, blood pressure: 12/7 cmHg, SaO2 82% on room air, cardiac frequency: 84 bpm, weight: 52 kg, height: 1.72 m, a SVCS, a bilateral pleural effusion syndrome, and right pulmonary condensation syndrome. Bone marrow aspiration had concluded in 85% large blasts sizes with irregular nucleus, nucleolus, hypogranulous cytoplasm, myeloperoxidase negative, and concluded in probable monocytic AML (AML5). Immunophenotyping concluded in acute myeloid leukemia: MPO: 75%, CD117: 98%, CD38: 98%, CD33: 26%, CD13: 22%, CD11c: 5%, HLA-DR: 3%, and CD14: 0%. Lymphoid T and B markers were negative. The karyotype revealed a complex hyperploidy: 51, XY, +4, +8, del (11) (q23), 19, 21, 21, 22 17/46, and XY 9. To explore the SVCS, electrocardiography was normal, echocardiography revealed dilated right atrium containing a pedunculated mass of 25.6 cm2 and heterogeneous irregular surface, appended to the atrial face of the anterior tricuspid valve with subtotal obstruction of the tricuspid orifice; the systolic ejection fraction of left ventricle is 60%. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 45 mmHg; he had moderate pulmonary hypertension. Thoracic angio-TDM showed intracardiac mass with a large parietal base, filling almost all the right atrium, penetrating the right ventricle, and surrounding the orifice of the superior vena cava which is not opacified. The mass dimension is 51.6 × 59 mm, condensation image site in the posterior part of the upper lobe of the right lung surrounded by a frosted glass image. The nature of this mass was unknown and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging had been objectified: venous thrombosis extended to the full height of the superior vena cava with thrombosis of the right atrium (Figures 1 and 2). To explore this thrombosis, tests of hemostasis are as follows: prothrombin 45%, partial thromboplastin time enhancer: 24.5 s (normal:  s), fibrinogen: 0.90 g/L, and D-dimers: 6000 mg/mL. A thrombophilic factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation of thrombin were negative. The proteins C and S and antithrombin III were normal.Moreover, the fluid and electrolyte balance and infectious workup were normal.In all, this is a case of a 35-year-old patient with hyperleukocytic AML 5 with complex karyotype complicated by a massive thrombosis extended from the atrium to the superior vena cava.He has been hospitalized and received hydration, cytarabine 100 mg flash for a 4 days’ cytoreduction, rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg/24 h the first two days, enoxaparin 10,000 IU per day, ciprofloxacin 200 mg/8 h, and fluconazole 200 mg/12 h. On the 5th day of hospitalization, he was induced to AML protocol: cytarabine 100 mg/m2/12 h of J1 to J10 and daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 once daily D2, D4, and D6. The electrolytic test has been done twice daily and the blood count once a day, and diuresis was assessed every 4 hours.A multidisciplinary staff had been held between hematologists, cardiologists, and cardiovascular surgeons and it has been decided not to perform surgery in view of the bleeding risk and to continue the anticoagulation treatment.The evolution was marked on the 8th day of induction by aplasia with a hemoglobin rate of 6 g/dL, white blood cells: 0.1 G/L with neutrophils: 0.02 g/L, and platelets: 20 G/L for which he has been transfused by red blood cells and platelets and then an accentuation of dyspnea, edema of the face and neck down to the chest and upper extremities, and the appearance of collateral venous circulation in the chest and a recurrent left pleural effusion after each puncture. In the 12th day of treatment, he died in a respiratory distress syndrome context.The patient had two emergencies: hyperleukocytic AML associated with massive thrombosis of the right atrium extending to the superior vena cava.Hyperleukocytic AML represents 10 to 18% of the adult AML [4]. This is an emergency diagnosis due to the risk of hyperviscosity syndrome resulting in neurological signs (confusion, psychomotor slowing, and blurred vision) of leukostasis mainly with respiratory signs (dyspnea and acute respiratory distress syndrome); coagulopathy (DIC), and tumor lysis syndrome [5].Thrombosis observed in AML is the result of multiple mechanisms: the release of procoagulant particles; reduced levels of natural anticoagulants; the decrease in the fibrinolytic activity; increased coagulation factors; platelet activation; and cytokine-induced expression of tissue factor in endothelial cells [6]. Acute promyelocytic leukemia is the most common AML provider of VTE. The AML 5 is associated in 25% of patients with thrombosis.Thrombosis in AML preferentially seats in the upper and lower limbs and the lungs [3]. Generally, the thrombus formation is less frequent in the right atrium compared with the left atrium [7]. It occurs in the presence of implanted catheters, particularly at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium and in patients with atrial fibrillation or prothrombotic states [7]. Thoracic angio-TDM is useful in diagnosis; magnetic resonance imaging can be used in patients in which radio-contrast agents are contraindicated [8]. Thoracic angio-TDM could not afford to know the nature of the right atrial mass of the patient and it is the magnetic resonance imaging that made the diagnosis of right atrial thrombosis. The treatment is not codified but several studies report a percutaneous stent implantation in patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms before the etiological treatment improves prognosis [9]. During evolution, the observed venous circulations are due to the fact that, because of this thrombosis, the body uses the ways of substitutions made by the azygos system, lumbar veins, spinal plexus, and thyroid veins which result in appearance of edema of neck, chest, and limbs [1]. Pulmonary hypertension could be an exaggerated cause of respiratory distress.If thrombosis is common in AML, the location in right atrium is rare, and one should think about it before a superior vena cava syndrome. Its management requires surgery that is sometimes difficult.Written consent to publish this report was obtained from the patient.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Bienvenu Houssou prepared the draft and Gnon Gourou Orou-Guiwa, Rachida Habbal, Meryem Qachouh, and Asmaa Quessar all reviewed and contributed to the final manuscript.
Successful Ablation for Atrial Tachycardia Originated from Sinus Venosa with Tachycardia-Induced Cardiomyopathy
Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Toda Chuo General Hospital, Toda,  JapanReceived 13 April 2016; Revised 15 July 2016; Accepted 7 August 2016Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2016 Sou Takenaka et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 74-year-old male suffering from congestive heart failure with atrial tachycardia (AT) with 2 : 1 atrioventricular conduction was admitted to our hospital. After the therapy with diuretics and β-blocker, his rapid AT was still sustained. He took the catheter ablation for his AT. Postpacing interval mapping from entrainment and noncontact mapping system revealed the mechanism of his AT, originated from sinus venosa. His AT was successfully terminated and eliminated by radiofrequency catheter ablation. After the successful ablation, he has been free from any AT, and his cardiac function was also improved.Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is considered reversible once the tachyarrhythmia is controlled with medication or ablation. Atrial tachycardia (AT) can be causing tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [1]. Entrainment mapping and electroanatomical mapping can reveal the mechanism of AT. However, in some cases of AT, it is sometimes difficult to identify the mechanism.AT is rarely originated from sinus venosa (SV) [2]. A functional line of conduction block is often observed in SV [3, 4]. We report a case of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy in a patient who successfully underwent catheter ablation for AT originated from SV.A 74-year-old male suffering from shortness of breath for 2 months was admitted to our hospital. His chest X-ray revealed expansion of CTR and pleural effusion. His electrocardiogram showed atrial tachycardia (AT) with 2 : 1 atrioventricular conduction (Figure 1). P wave morphology was positive in inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) and positive in lead V1. Ultrasound cardiography revealed a poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF = 22%). His AT resulted in cardiac failure with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. After the treatment for the heart failure with anticoagulant therapy, he underwent an electrophysiological study.His tachycardia cycle length (TCL) was 230 ms, and the postpacing intervals (PPIs) from entrainment of cavotricuspid isthmus (280 ms), the lateral site of tricuspid annulus (260 ms), and the ostium of coronary sinus (340 ms) were long PPI-TCL (>30 ms). The PPI from the posterior wall of high right atrium (240 ms) matched his TCL closely. We inserted and positioned the multielectrode array into the right atrium. The dynamic activation map during his AT revealed focal AT arising from the posterior medial wall of high right atrium. The activation site was moved to the high right atrium and down along the crista terminalis (Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c)). The earliest potential preceded the onset of the P wave at the surface ECG by 80 ms (Figure 3(a)). In addition, the local electrogram at the site of tachycardia origin recorded the double potential (Figure 3(a)). The noncontact unipolar electrogram revealed a QS pattern of the origin (Figure 3(b)). In addition, 8 mm of preferential pathway existed (Figure 3(c)). We defined that his AT was originated from the SV. Radiofrequency (RF) energy delivery at the site of this origin slowed the tachycardia cycle length and finally resulted in sinus rhythm within 15 seconds. There was no inducible tachycardia thereafter, and his cardiac function was also improved (LVEF = 50%).The SV is located at the posteromedial right atrium. In this case, during atrial flutter, a functional blockline is seen at the SV [5]. Park et al. reported that focal AT which develops during atrial fibrillation ablation is rarely originated from SV [2]. In this case, the earliest activation site was the posterolateral right atrium, and double potentials were recorded at this site. We defined that his AT was arising from SV and successfully terminated using focal RF application at that site.The algorithm of the P wave is helpful for prediction of AT foci. In this case, P wave morphology during AT wasisoelectric in inferior leads (II, III, and aVF), positive in V1 lead, and isoelectric in aVL. Kistler et al. [6] reported that a negative or positive-negative biphasic P wave in lead V1 was associated with specificity of 100% for right atrial tachycardia, and positive or negative-positive biphasic in lead V1 was associated with that of 100% for left atrial tachycardia. Park et al. [2] reported that negative or positive-negative biphasic P wave was shown in only 70% of patients with AT arising from sinus venosa.To our knowledge, SV has not previously been reported as the focal origin of AT [7]. SV is located in the posterior medial wall of the RA rather than posterior lateral wall. It also has a functional blockline [5] and low-voltage area [3], which was critical for the reentrant circuit in right atrium. In this case, success site of RF catheter was positioned in the posteromedial wall of the RA (Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 3(b)). In addition, the right atrial activation mapping on noncontact mapping system suspected that the earliest activation site was SV. The local electrogram at this site recorded the double potential. The diagnosis was confirmed by entrainment pacing showing the shortest postpacing interval at SV. Focal RF ablation at SV was successful in eliminating AT. The mechanism of his AT was focal and microreentrant [8]. The preferential pathway was present, and its length was about 8 mm. This finding suggested that his SV might have some remodeling, such as fibrosis [8].The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
An Endomyocardial Biopsy of the Left Ventricle in an Anorexia Nervosa Patient with Sinus Bradycardia and Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction
Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiovascular Division, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya,  JapanReceived 26 July 2016; Accepted 28 September 2016Academic Editor: Hiroaki KitaokaCopyright © 2016 Satoshi Takahashi  and Takanao Mine. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted perception of body weight. AN is a life-threatening condition that significantly increases the risk of death due to cardiac complications, such that at least one-third of all deaths in patients with AN are associated with cardiac causes including sudden death. In many reports, sudden death has been linked to reduced left ventricular function, structural changes, and QT abnormalities. However, the mechanistic details connecting AN to cardiac abnormalities remain unknown. Here we present an endomyocardial biopsy of the left ventricle in a case of AN with a reversible left ventricular systolic dysfunction.A 17-year-old female with no medical history complained of general fatigue and bradycardia from three months before. Her height, body weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 161 cm, 45 kg, and 17.4 kg/m2, respectively. A physical examination indicated that the blood pressure and heart rate are 87/46 mmHg and 38 beats/min, respectively. Laboratory data indicated an elevation of hepatic enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, 21 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 28 IU/L), hypoproteinemia (total protein, 6.1 g/dL; albumin, 3.9 g/dL), hypoglycemia (blood glucose, 67 mg/dL), and a decrease in free triiodothironene (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels (FT3, 0.87 pg/mL; FT4 0.87 ng/dL). Thyroid stimulating hormone (4.610 μIU/L) was normal. The total blood ketone level was high (114 mmol/L), but the levels of thiamin (2.7 μg/dL), cobalamin (548 pg/mL), folic acid (4.8 ng/mL), growth hormone (6.17 ng/mL), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (31.3 pg/mL) were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram showed bradycardia with junctional rhythm and prolonged QT interval (Figure 1). A cardiac echocardiogram showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 45%) with apical wall motion decline of both ventricles and both ventricles were dilated (LV diastolic dimension: LVDd 52 mm) (Figure 2). A coronary angiogram showed no stenosis or obstruction, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show late gadolinium enhancement. An endomyocardial biopsy revealed moderate vacuolar degeneration, hypertrophy, and attenuation of the myocardium as well as moderate interstitial fibrosis. Any inflammatory cell infiltrate, myocardial edema, or necrosis was not observed (Figure 3). The patient was diagnosed with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with sick sinus syndrome at the time.An angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) was prescribed without pacemaker implantation since the fatigue was clearly not related to the bradycardia. During the follow-up, cardiac echocardiographic findings after four months did not improve (LVEF 44%, LVDd 49 mm); her body weight reduced to 34.1 kg (BMI 13.6 kg/m2) after losing 16 kg in six months, and she was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN) by a psychiatrist. The patient received nutritional counseling and appropriate psychotherapy to increase her caloric intake. One month later, her body weight increased to 43.5 kg (BMI 16.8 kg/m2), heart rate (HR) increased to 66 beats/min with sinus rhythm, and LVEF increased to 55%. One year later, her body weight increased to 54 kg (BMI 20.8 kg/m2), HR increased to 70 beats/min, and LVEF rose to 60%.This is the first report documenting the findings from an endomyocardial biopsy of the LV in an anorexia nervosa patient with sinus bradycardia and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.The main cardiovascular complications in patients with AN are bradycardia, systolic dysfunction, impaired ventricular repolarization, low blood pressure, QT interval prolongation, mitral valve prolapse, and reduction of myocardial contractility [1, 2]. The mechanistic pathways linking AN to left ventricular systolic function decline are not clear. However, several reports have revealed that cardiomyopathy in patients with AN is in fact a reversible ventricular dysfunction [3]. It is thus believed that patients with AN exhibit conditions involving a decrease in LV systolic function, such as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, as a result of low blood sugar starvation. Specifically, this case study indicated a decline in the apex LV wall motion that mimics Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Sachdeva et al. showed that an experimental model of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy presents persistent foci of necrosis and fibrosis [4]. Izgi et al. reported myocardial edema as one of the characteristic features in the pathogenesis of Takotsubo syndrome [5]. Although the patient in our case study showed signs of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, the endomyocardial biopsy of the LV did not show necrosis and the cardiac MRI did not demonstrate myocardial edema like in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. As such, the mechanism of left ventricular systolic function might be different from Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.The LV abnormal wall motion might be caused by energy imbalance, particularly protein-calorie imbalance, from self-induced starvation. Moreover, malnutrition alters the blood concentration of various hormones (e.g., insulin, thyroid hormones, glucocorticoids, and growth hormones). As a result, the myocardium at the cellular level might suffer from diminished protein synthesis, decreased cardiac mass, and changes in myocardial contractility [2]. Consequently, depletion of intramyocardial glycogen and myocardium atrophy could cause a decrease in vagal tone, bradycardia, and QT interval prolongation.An anorexia nervosa case with bradycardia and left ventricular systolic dysfunction showed the pathological changes of the myocardium. A girl suspected of having dilated cardiomyopathy needs a differential diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

A Sizable Aortic Root Paravalvular Mycotic Pseudoaneurysm
Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah,  Saudi ArabiaReceived 26 May 2016; Accepted 15 September 2016Academic Editor: Takatoshi KasaiCopyright © 2016 Ahmad Saeed Azhar  and Noran M. Abu-Ouf. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Mycotic aneurysm is an established condition first identified in 1885 by Sir William Osler. It is linked to malignant endocarditis. With prevalence of 0.7–2.6% of all cases of aortic aneurysms, it is associated with a significant rate of mortality and morbidity. Physicians should be highly cautious, as diagnosis and effective treatment for this condition are difficult. The following is a case report of a 13-year-old pediatric patient diagnosed with mycotic aneurysm. Before an adequate treatment plan could be developed and implemented, patient’s status worsened swiftly and was ultimately terminal. This case is the sole instance of this condition evidenced in the last ten years in Saudi Arabia.A 13-year-old, not known to have had any previous medical or surgical problems, presented to the Emergency Department (ER) with a two-week history of fever, shortness of breath, a dry cough, chills, and night sweats. One week prior to presentation, he had experienced orthopnea, palpitations, and central chest pain. On initial physical examination, the patient blood pressure was 110/50 mmHg, and he was tachycardic (147 beats/min.), febrile (39°C), and tachypneic (55 breath/min). Oxygen saturation (97%) was enabled by use of a 10 L facial mask. A chest examination revealed scattered crepitation and a gallop rhythm with pansystolic and early diastolic murmurs (grade 4/6 with thrill). An abdominal examination revealed a tender liver; however, there was no palpable mass or organomegaly. Blood analysis revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 16.3/μL) with a heightened erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 68 mm/H and a C-reactive protein concentration of 98 mg/L. Further, all cultures (urine, blood, sputum, and throat viral cultures) were negative after 5 days of incubation. Common laboratory testing of urine, electrolytes, and renal and hepatic profiles was normal. Plain radiography of the chest was also found to be normal.Initially, the patient was admitted from the ER to the pediatric medical ward. Later at the same day, when he showed signs of respiratory distress, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further management. In the PICU, the patient was kept on bilevel positive airway pressure and steroids. Consequently, the patient was started on Furosemide (20 mg/8 h), dobutamine (10 mcg/kg/min), and antibiotics; ceftriaxone was started immediately in the ER. Later, at the same day, broad-spectrum antibiotics were added (Vancomycin and Gentamycin) as a treatment of bacterial endocarditis, until any result of blood culture and sensitivity testing is established. All medications were given intravenously. An echocardiography was performed immediately, which indicated evidence of heart failure and infective endocarditis, with suspected mycotic aortic aneurysm (Figure 1). There was mild to moderate aortic valve regurgitation and fair myocardiac contractility with an Ejection Fraction (EF) of 42% and Shortening Fraction (SF) of 18%.Urgent electrocardiogram- (ECG-) synchronized intravenous (IV) contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) imaging of the heart and aorta was subsequently performed, demonstrating a sizable aortic root paravalvular mycotic pseudoaneurysm with internal vegetation (Figures 2 and 3). Accordingly, the diagnosis of both mycotic aortic aneurysm and heart failure due to infective endocarditis was confirmed.The patient was scheduled for surgical intervention on the following day (aortic aneurysm excision and graft replacement), with a plan of cleaning and debridement of the aortic valve and root, followed by reconstruction with aortic homograft. Unfortunately, the patient developed arrhythmia, hypotension, and shock hours later, with subsequent desaturation and cardiac arrest (≤2 minutes). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was applied for 20 minutes, but there was no response and the patient died. Autopsy was intended to be taken in order to confirm the diagnosis, but, unfortunately, parents refused it.Mycotic aneurysm of the aorta, especially with a thoracic element, rarely occurs in children and it can result in mortality subsequent to intervention delay [1, 2]. When it does occur, it is usually in children with such underlying congenital heart diseases as persistent ductus arteriosus, aortic coarctation, or aortic valve irregularities [3]. In certain instances, it may evolve as a consequence of surgical trauma after an aortotomy or manipulation of a catheter within the artery [3]. It is thought that there are three main causes. First, it may be a result of infected emboli following infective endocarditis or systemic bacteremia, which gather in a diseased artery, triggering damage to the wall. This ultimately can result in an infected aneurysm. A second scenario is that it may stem from an extravascular infectious focus, which leads to necrosis in the arterial wall and ensuing aneurysm development. A third scenario is superinfection of an already established aneurysm [4, 5]. Depending on the extent of arterial wall infection, mycotic aneurysms may be separated into true aneurysms, which occur when all three strata of the arterial wall are compromised, or false aneurysms (also referred to as pseudoaneurysms), which can occur when aneurysmal dilation includes part of the media, the adventitia, and periadventitial tissues [6]. Clinical presentation of this condition varies widely and is contingent on the affected aspect of the aorta. Usually, at presentation, patients are septic and febrile [7]. Prompt diagnosis and proper management with antibiotics accompanied by pressing surgical intervention are vital to optimizing patient’s status [7]. Nevertheless, mycotic aortic aneurysms continue to be linked to an elevated risk of adverse health sequelae and high mortality rate, irrespective of improvements in vascular surgery [8]. Prevalent outcomes from mycotic aneurysm that do not receive treatment comprise rupture, fistula formation, sepsis, erosion, and fatality [4, 7].In this case, diagnosis of infective endocarditis was delayed until patient’s clinical presentation. It is possible that the patient had a previously undiagnosed congenital heart condition, leading to infective endocarditis and ultimately the development of a mycotic aortic aneurysm. To confirm this diagnosis, we utilized a noninvasive ECG-synchronized IV contrast-enhanced cardiac MDCT, which has been shown to be efficacious in assessing infective endocarditis [9], especially for detecting the degree of paravalvular extension within the infection [9]. Further, it is effective in determining coronary artery status, thus supporting the avoidance of high-risk preprocedural invasive catheter coronary angiography [10, 11].Even though the patient received antibiotic and anticardiac failure treatment as soon as the diagnosis was suspected, it seems that patient’s situation was deteriorating, which may have been avoided if the root cause had been determined earlier. Despite no clear established cause of mortality, it is considered probable that the patient experienced a ruptured mycotic aortic aneurysm, resulting in hypovolemic shock, as indicated by desaturation, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. Another possible cause, such as sepsis, was eliminated, as the patient was taking appropriate antibiotic medication. Unfortunately, autopsy has not been done which could have confirmed findings on imaging and confirmed the definite cause of death (probably rupture, but coronary embolism from a vegetation is also an option); however, parents refused it.This case emphasizes the critical importance of prompt diagnosis followed by rapid surgical treatment in patients with mycotic aortic aneurysm in order to avoid patient mortality. Research indicates that the standard approach for mycotic aneurysm is rapid surgical treatment accompanied by longitudinal antibiotic treatment in order to limit widespread infection and to accomplish cardiovascular stability. The most important message from this case is not to delay diagnosis and high-risk surgery, which all need to be done simultaneously in the same day at least instead of doing things step-by-step to prevent rupture and mortality.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Dr. Noran Mohammed Abu-Ouf participated in collection the essential patients information, which is needed in drafting the article, revising it critically for the important intellectual content.

A Case of Haemorrhagic Constrictive Pericarditis with Bilateral Pleural Effusions
1Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital Center, Valhalla, NY,  USA2Division of Cardiology, New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital Center, Valhalla, NY,  USAReceived 21 August 2016; Accepted 22 September 2016Academic Editor: Christian MachadoCopyright © 2016 Hans A. Reyes et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Presentation of pericardial disease is diverse, with the viral aetiology being the most common cause; however, when haemorrhagic pericardial effusion is present, these causes are narrowed to few aetiologies. We present a case of a young female of African descent who presented with diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting. Initial work-up showed pericardial effusion with impending echocardiographic findings of cardiac tamponade and bilateral pleural effusions. Procedures included a left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with pericardial window. We consider that it is important for all physicians to be aware of not only typical presentation but also atypical and unusual clinical picture of pericardial disease.For a haemorrhagic pericardial effusion, the culprits are limited to a few aetiologies including myocardial infarction, trauma, tuberculosis, malignancy, or aortic dissection, all of which can lead to cardiac tamponade, hemodynamic instability, and compromise. Moreover, in young patients without remarkable history of cardiac disease, infections should be ruled out first.A 31-year-old female from Mali who had been living in the United States for the past three years presented to the Emergency Department complaining of diffuse abdominal pain for 6 days and one episode of nonbilious vomiting. Past medical history included uncontrolled hypertension due to medication nonadherence. Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 161/109 mmHg, heart rate of 114 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 per minute, O2sat of 98% on room air, and temperature of 37°C. There were normal heart sounds and normal lung sounds, there were no rubs and no JVD, and abdomen was soft with RUQ tenderness and no peripheral edema. An EKG confirmed sinus tachycardia with left axis deviation, normal voltage, ST segment, and QRS complexes. Laboratory data were as follows: WBC of 8020/µL, Hb/Hcto of 10/31, normal electrolytes and renal function, hepatic function remarkable for hypoalbuminemia, 2.6 g/dL, and normal coagulation profile. Cardiomegaly and blunting of the right and left costophrenic angles were evident on chest X-ray. An abdominal and pelvis CT was ordered due to persistence of abdominal pain despite opioids analgesics, and it incidentally showed a large pericardial effusion along with bilateral pleural effusions (Figure 1(a)), worse on the left. No underlying aetiology for her abdominal pain could be visualized on abdominal CT.Shortly thereafter, the patient started to complain of shortness of breath, chest tightness, and orthopnoea, which varied with position and was relieved by sitting upright and leaning forward. A 2D echocardiogram showed preserved LVEF, >55%, pericardial effusion of moderate size with right atrial late diastolic collapse, dilated nonpulsatile inferior vena cava (IVC), mitral flow velocity paradoxus (≥25% change in E wave flow velocity during inspiration compared to expiration), and A′ wave greater than E′ wave in tissue Doppler (consistent with impaired filling pattern, which can be restrictive or constrictive) (Figure 1(b)), and she was immediately transferred to Coronary Care Unit. Pulsus paradoxus was not ever greater than 10 mmHg during her stay; no fever was reported as well. An IR-guided pericardiocentesis was performed showing 200 mL of blood-tinged fluid, RBC of 508,500/mm3, and WBC of 950/mm3 with 88% segments. Cytology study was negative for malignant cells. In the repeated 2D echocardiogram after drainage, E′ wave became greater than A′ wave in tissue Doppler, which is more consistent with pericardial constriction. Laboratory work-up for autoimmune aetiologies, cardiotropic viruses, and bacterial infections including tuberculosis were unremarkable for any positive findings. The rest of the ancillary laboratory revealed iron deficiency anaemia and elevation of ESR and C-reactive protein, 50 mm/h and 251 mg/L, respectively. HIV test, PPD, and cancer markers such as CEA and CA 19-9 were also negative. Then, initial subxiphoid pericardial window attempt was unsuccessful due to a thickened pericardium firmly attached to the heart and sternum. The following day, left VATS with pericardial window was done. Again, the pericardium appeared to be thickened and was extremely adherent to the myocardium. Fluid from pericardial and pleural effusions was again sanguineous with no malignant cells. Cultures remained negative; adenosine deaminase (ADA) from pleural fluid and PCR assay for tuberculosis from pericardial fluid came back normal as well. Biopsy of pericardial tissue was consistent with chronic pericarditis, while pleural biopsy confirmed reactive pleuritis. Acid fast and silver stains were normal.After extensive negative work-up, patient was started on colchicine 0.6 mg daily; she progressively and slowly improved during the rest of her stay. Repeated chest CT and echocardiogram after almost one month of hospitalization showed only small accumulation of pericardial fluid (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)).Upon discharge, the patient was seen in the medicine and cardiology clinic as outpatient at one-month and two-month follow-up. She was doing well and was asymptomatic and adherent to medication including colchicine 0.6 mg daily.We are describing this case of idiopathic haemorrhagic constrictive pericarditis presenting with impending echocardiographic findings of cardiac tamponade. When a patient presents with a haemorrhagic pericardial effusion, it is always a challenge to determine the aetiology; however, tuberculosis and malignancy should be ruled out first [1–3]. Our patient had emigrated from Mali three years prior to presentation, provoking high suspicion of tuberculosis; nevertheless, repeated AFBs from sputum and fluids, cultures, PPD, and ADA from pleural fluid and PCR from pericardial fluid came back negative. Viral, fungal infection and autoimmune diseases were ruled out as well. We thoroughly evaluated secondary causes for haemorrhagic effusion; however, ancillary tests were not diagnostic. As aforementioned, haemorrhagic effusion can also be seen in patients with pericarditis after myocardial infarction, trauma, aortic dissection, or uremic pericarditis but this was not our patient’s presentation. Roughly 80 to 90% of pericardial effusions will remain idiopathic after an extensive work-up [1, 2].Our patient’s initial presentation was not typical for pericardial tamponade. However, one may argue that, in subacute or chronic processes, typical signs like tachycardia, hypotension, JVD, and diminished heart sounds have low sensitivity. Even pulsus paradoxus, the cornerstone in cardiac tamponade, has a variable incidence ranging from 12% to 75% [3]. Echocardiography remains an important diagnostic tool which allows us to identify signs of tamponade such as collapse of the right atrium, engorgement of the IVC, or right ventricular diastolic collapse. It is, however, important to note that not all effusions will need surgical intervention. It should only be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or if purulent fluid was noted during an intervention [4, 5].The fact that the pericardium was thickened and extremely adherent to myocardium during the two surgical interventions along with constrictive filling pattern on echocardiogram and biopsy findings support a chronic process in this patient. This clinical picture is consistent with constrictive pericarditis. It is a rare type of pericarditis which develops insidiously and in many cases no aetiology is ever determined. The principal causes are idiopathic and cardiothoracic surgery and previous radiation [6]. Our patient did not have a previous history of surgery or radiation; again infections, uraemia, neoplasms, connective tissue disorders, and trauma were ruled out. Constrictive pericarditis is a potentially curable disease if it is diagnosed early but could be potentially fatal if it was overlooked. The reason why the patient developed bilateral pleural effusions is still unknown; however, the initial pericardial effusion and quantity of inflammation with fibrin accumulation may have subsequently triggered pleural inflammation and effusion by proximity.For cases where aetiology remains unclear as in our patient, studies recommend the use of colchicine and NSAIDs [1, 7]. Aside from this atypical presentation, the slow but progressive response to colchicine leads us to believe in an idiopathic aetiology or it could be related to previously unrecognized viral pericarditis. We decided not to use NSAIDs due to the concern that this may worsen the haemorrhagic effusion and delay recovery.In short, no matter how atypical the clinical picture may be, the majority of cases of pericarditis are of unknown aetiology. At her two-month follow-up, the patient has remained asymptomatic and has responded well to colchicine alone. An idiopathic cause should be considered only after all other possibilities have been exhausted, even if a large haemorrhagic effusion is seen. We consider that the patient might be at risk of developing long-term constrictive pericarditis which is associated with high morbidity. Additional echocardiograms will be beneficial for her during her subsequent follow-ups.Patient’s consent was obtained.The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.

On our clinical vignette entitled “Symptomatic Trifascicular Block in Steinert’s Disease: Is It Too Soon for a Pacemaker?” [4], we tried to retrieve the specific genetic code and expansion repeats for our patient but to no avail. The patient’s neurologist retired a decade ago and we were unable to get the specific information about the genetics of our patient’s disease. This concern had been raised by the editor prior to the approval of the manuscript. Family members were also contacted and were out of state and not living within the patient’s locality anymore and were unwilling to divulge further information about their medical illnesses.With regards to the patient’s mental status, he has been alert, oriented, and coherent with no signs of any memory lapses or confusion. No further neurologic investigation was done since the dizziness improved significantly after the insertion of the pacemaker.His pacemaker has been checked every six months and has no recorded ventricular arrhythmias. Also, there has been no elucidated significant history of cardiac disease in the family including sudden cardiac death.The patient did not have frontal balding, cataracts, or myopathic face but has distal weakness and mild wasting as well as dysphagia compatible with esophageal dysmotility as documented on fluoroscopic barium esophagogram and upper gastrointestinal series.As much as we want to include every detail of pertinent information in our clinical vignette, it has been restricted by the inability to extract the exact information from remote medical records and significant others’ inability to share relevant information.Truly, the relevance of such an interesting case could be increased by providing detailed clinical, genetic, and familial historical information to comprehensively investigate DM1 patients and their families to clear the enigma associated with this disease.The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.
Successful Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion with the New Generation Amulet® Device after Late-Occurring Embolization of an Amplatzer® Cardiac Plug in a Patient with Repetitive Strokes
1Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, Heart Center, University of Göttingen, Göttingen,  Germany2Internal Medicine I, Helios Albert-Schweitzer Clinic Northeim, Northeim,  GermanyReceived 18 August 2016; Revised 12 September 2016; Accepted 18 September 2016Academic Editor: Ramazan AkdemirCopyright © 2016 Marco R. Schroeter  and Wolfgang Schillinger. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (ACP) is one of the most commonly used devices for percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure in order to prevent a stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and contraindication for long-term oral anticoagulation therapy. We have previously described a patient who had experienced an embolization of the ACP device about 12 months after implantation and the device could be percutaneously retrieved. A few years later, he suffered from a posterior stroke and a stroke located in the brainstem as well as a transischemic attack (TIA). In order to protect him from further cardioembolic events a reocclusion of the LAA with the new generation of ACP device, the Amplatzer Amulet, was performed. A stable position of the device within follow-up period could be confirmed and the patient was free of additional strokes/TIA or bleeding events. This case stresses the importance of proper LAA sizing in order to prevent device embolization and notes that LAA size is not static. Moreover, it demonstrates that repeated implantation of an LAA occlusion device was still possible; one should be aware of undersizing the LAA dimensions and that the modifications of new generation LAA occlusion devices may overcome limitations of first-generation devices in order to prevent a cardioembolic stroke.The Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (ACP; St. Jude Medical) is one of the most commonly used devices for percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure in order to prevent a stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and contraindication for long-term oral anticoagulation therapy.We have previously published a paper describing a 75-year-old patient who had experienced an embolization of the ACP device about 12 months after implantation [1].Recently, a new generation of ACP device, the Amplatzer Amulet, has been made commercially available. The main concept of the Amulet device is based on the first generation of ACP with a distal lobe and a proximal disk connected by an articulating waist. The lobe has stabilizing hooks to assure retention and the disc seals the outer shape of the LAA orifice [2]. The modifications of the Amulet device include new features to facilitate device deployment and to reduce the embolization risk [3]. The experiences with the new Amulet device are limited so far [3–5].The above-mentioned patient was discharged at that time after ACP retrieval without an LAA device on an antiplatelet therapy with ASA. Subsequently, he suffered from a posterior stroke and a stroke located in the brainstem as well as a transischemic attack (TIA) in the area of the left cerebri media artery. The patient had been repetitively hospitalized in the stroke-unit/neurological department of our hospital. No relevant extra- or intracerebral stenosis could be detected and a cardioembolic genesis of stroke/TIA caused by atrial fibrillation was presumed. Due to the bleeding risk with the history of intracerebral bleeding, an oral anticoagulation therapy was still contraindicated. In order to protect him from further cardioembolic events we decided to perform reocclusion of the LAA.The procedure was performed percutaneously using a transseptal approach under transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and fluoroscopy guidance (Figure 1). The diameter of a potential “landing zone” in the LAA was unexpectedly found to be greater than during the first intervention: 23 mm (compared to 19 mm measured before) and an Amplatzer Amulet of 28 mm was successfully implanted (Figure 1). After echocardiologic and fluoroscopic control on the next day were inconspicuous, the patient was discharged on an ASA and clopidogrel therapy. Repetitive echocardiographic controls were performed at the date of implantation as well as 3 and 6 months after implantation (3D-TEE; Figure 2(a)). Color Doppler TEE revealed no signs of residual shunt between the LAA and the left atrium (Figure 2(b)). After 3 months the medication was reduced to an ASA monotherapy (100 mg SID) and the patient was free of additional strokes/TIA or bleeding events until now.The existing case reports and a recently published study with 17 patients described the implantation of the new Amulet device in the normal context of a single implanted LAA device [3–5]. In our case, it was the second device in the same patient after the embolization of the initially implanted ACP device. Subsequently, we had a longer follow-up period with TEE controls compared to previously published reports.Moreover, this case stresses the importance of proper LAA sizing in order to prevent possible device embolization. It is of note that LAA size is not static. Changes in cardiac preload induce dynamic changes of LAA size. For this reason and with implication for the clinical operation procedure, adequate intravascular volume status must be ensured before final sizing and occluder selection. In addition, dilation of the LAA may occur over time as a result of the remodelling process associated with atrial fibrillation [6]. However, a recently published single case report hypothesizes that LAA device embolization could occur without obvious explanation, despite correct device sizing and sufficient stability tests [7].In summary, this case demonstrates that repeated implantation of an LAA occlusion device was still possible; one should be aware of undersizing the LAA dimensions (in respect to the volume status of the patient) and modifications of new generation LAA occlusion devices may overcome limitations of first generation, even if further studies with the new devices are necessary.M.

Multifactorial Etiology Pulmonary Hypertension in a Patient with Sarcoidosis

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Differential diagnosis between pre- and postcapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with diastolic heart failure (DHF) is a challenge in clinical practice. The presence of PH is implicated in worse prognosis in patients with this disease. This case report approaches the process of investigation of pulmonary hypertension in adult patient with DHF, double mitral lesion, and sarcoidosis with poor clinical outcome.Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by pulmonary artery medium pressure (PAPm) ≥25 mmHg at rest, measured by right heart catheterization. It could be due to a primary increase in the pulmonary arterial system (PAH) or, when secondary, to the increase in the venous system pressure as well within the pulmonary capillary (pulmonary venous hypertension). Also, it can happen in association with a series of clinical conditions [1]. In clinical practice, however, its interpretation, etiologic diagnosis, and therapeutic approach are still a challenge for clinicians.The pathogenesis of PH is complex and, in most cases, multifactorial. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH group 1) is a proliferative vasculopathy of pulmonary arteriolar musculature. On the other hand, the pathophysiology of PH secondary to left heart failure (HF), PH postcapillary or group 2, is less understood. However, it is established that there may be an overlap of these PH etiologies since vascular remodeling and increased pulmonary vascular resistance are common features in both groups. For this group, more studies to evaluate the real benefit of therapy for PH are necessary [2].Among the most emblematic diagnostic challenges, we could cite patients in whom left HF does not explain the degree of PH or when there is a second potential etiology.In sarcoidosis (PH group 5), pathological mechanisms of PH are also multiple and complex: pulmonary fibrosis and hypoxemia, granulomatous involvement of arterioles or pulmonary veins, and compression of the proximal pulmonary arteries by hilar lymph nodes [3].We describe a case report of a dialytic patient, with association of pulmonary sarcoidosis, HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), PH, and mitral valve disease refractory to optimal medical treatment.A male patient, 53 years old, was admitted to the internal medicine ward of the University Hospital of the Federal University of Sergipe on 31/3/15 with dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, nocturnal paroxystic dyspnea, and edema of the lower limbs during one month. He reported dyspnea related to moderate to intense efforts, starting 18 years earlier (when pulmonary sarcoidosis was suspected and confirmed through transbronchial lung biopsy). In the last 4 years, he mentioned mild effort dyspnea/leg edema. The echocardiography exam presented moderate mitral stenosis with severe calcification of the valve and subvalve apparatus, in spite of the lack of a rheumatic disease history. Among the comorbidities, he presented signs and symptoms of severe chronic renal failure for the earlier six years (actually, he was under dialysis for about 4.5 years) and epilepsy (about 15 years). He was a former smoker (15 packs/year) and referred to previous exposure to dust in work place.He took regularly metoprolol 50 mg/day, Amlodipine 2.5 mg/day, Sildenafil 20 mg q8 hr, hemodialysis q2 days, prednisone 10 mg/day, Sevelamer 800 mg q8 hr, Phenobarbital 100 mg/day, and the folic acid/calcitriol. He reported episodes of symptomatic hypotension, a fact that do not allow drug optimization of heart failure (HF) and motivated hospitalization for clinical compensation.On physical examination, his skin was pale, albeit hydrated. In the cardiac auscultation, there was a regular rhythm, presence of premature beats, grade III mitral, and tricuspid systolic murmur, accentuated second sound. The heart rate was 92 beats per minute and the blood pressure was  mmHg. We also noticed jugular venous distension, even while standing. In the lung auscultation, murmurs were present in both sides, but markedly decreased at right lower lobe. The respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute. The abdomen was flat, and we could touch the inferior boarder of the liver at four centimeters from the costal margin (painful on palpation). There was evidence of edema within the abdominal wall. The skin was hot and dry, there was ankle pitting, and we could classify the degree of edema as 3+ (maximum = 4) in the tibiae. The peripheral pulse was present and symmetric.The chest radiography (Figure 1) showed an increased cardiac area, middle arch rectification, left atrial increase, bilateral calcified hilar lymphadenopathy, and Kerley B lines. The electrocardiogram presented sinus rhythm with heart rate of 92 bpm, right axis deviation, divisional posterior inferior blocking, and increased P (biatrial overload) and T waves (secondary changes in ventricular repolarization). The evolutionary findings of EchoDopplercardiograms (ED) transthoracic revealed progression of mitral stenosis (mitral valve opening evolved from 1.35 cm2 to 1 cm2), extensive calcification of the mitral valve (score of Wilkin’s 15 points), moderate aortic and tricuspid insufficiency, and normofunctioning pulmonary valve. The systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PASP) worsened (48 mmHg to 79 mmHg) and micronodular hyperechoic images were noted diffusely in left ventricle myocardium. Comparative description of diameters and ejection fraction are shown in Table 1.Hemodialysis was instituted daily in order to improve clinical status. The doses of metoprolol (150 mg/day) and prednisone (40 mg/day) were increased. However, the approaches adopted have not accomplished any success.The right heart catheterization was performed for the investigation of pulmonary arterial hypertension with nitroprusside 200 μg/mL at a dose of 2.8 mcg/kg/min for 1 h. The following pressures were obtained: (a) before vasodilator: pulmonary artery pressure, 76/30 mmHg (mean 51) and Aorta, 96/76 mmHg (mean 85); (b) after vasodilator: pulmonary artery, 65/31 mmHg (mean 49) and Aorta, 104/53 mmHg (mean 70 mmHg). The end-diastolic pressure of the left ventricle was 20 mmHg and coronary angiography revealed only mild diffuse parietal irregularities.A few days later, the patient developed drowsiness, tachypnea, use of accessory respiratory muscles, 94% of arterial oxygen saturation on supplemental oxygen 3 L/min, blood pressure  mmHg, heart rate 112 beats per minute, worsening of mitral systolic murmur (grade IV) and mitral diastolic murmur, cold and clammy skin, and weak pulse. He was transferred to the intensive care unit to receive hemodynamic support with vasoactive drugs, but he evolved with refractory shock and death.The PH is a common complication of left HF; usually its manifestation often overlaps with those of underlying condition and implicates more severe clinical presentation. In clinical practice, the diagnosis is usually done indirectly, through transthoracic ED. However, their interpretation, main diagnosis, and therapeutic approach still are a challenge for clinician [4].The comparative analysis of ED showed unfavorable evolution of mitral stenosis, valve area reduction, left atrial enlargement, worsening of PSAP, and right chambers enlargement. These data corroborate the etiology of postcapillary PH in this patient (group 2 PH, associated with left heart disease) [5].The postcapillary PH is more common in HFpEF which consists of abnormality in active relaxation and active stiffness (diastolic dysfunction) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. When HFpEF occurs, it results in more severe symptoms and worsening of exercise tolerance, hallmark of the patient in question [4, 6].As there was not found satisfactory reduction in PAPm under vasodilator testing (pulmonary reactivity criteria: fall PAPm to <49 mmHg, reduction of at least 10 mmHg, or maintenance/increase in cardiac output) and the estimated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 20 mmHg, it infers fix PH with postcapillary component probably secondary to valve heart disease. The differential diagnosis between PH modalities before and after capillary in patients with HFpEF is a challenge in daily clinical practice and it entails difficulty on treating this subgroup of patients. However, the literature states that group 2 PH patients can have precapillary component, featuring a mixed PH [2]. Thus, it was decided to maintain the treatment with phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors even after the above examinations do not corroborate primary etiology. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the benefit of therapy for PH in this group.The diagnosis of PH, by itself, cannot exclude the possibility of it being due to mitral valve disease in this patient. However, the prescription of sildenafil started long before the clinical presentation of the valve disease and, at that early phase, the treatment improved the patient condition. Notwithstanding, we must acknowledge that sildenafil could potentially contribute to the clinical deterioration of the patient. Indeed, due to an increase of symptoms a few weeks before the fatal event, the use of sildenafil was put to a halt.Myocardial infiltration, sarcoidosis characteristic, viewed at ED probably did not contribute to the clinical presentation, as usually it manifests itself with restrictive cardiomyopathy, ventricular aneurysm, pericardial disease, infiltrative valve dysfunction, ventricular tachycardia, and supraventricular arrhythmias [3].In this case the surgical approach of mitral valve was not possible. The patient did not have favorable valve anatomical conditions to mitral stenosis percutaneous repair and also had high surgical risk (severe pulmonary hypertension and disorders of right ventricle and kidneys) to mitral valve replacement. There was no possibility to carry out more radical therapies like cardiac transplantation because of severe fixed pulmonary hypertension and atrial septostomy because of high mortality inherent to it [7].It is very difficult to determine the time when HF patient care should be palliative. Anguita and Ojeda [8] defined a few points to guidance in making this decision: class functional III-IV despite optimal treatment, absence of triggering factors or advanced treatable comorbidities that limit survival, hypotension, renal failure, and frequent decompensation despite maximum tolerated treatment. All these prognostic factors were presented in this case and it was featured as terminal HF.The authors state that for this investigation there has been no experience in humans and/or animals.The authors state that they followed the protocols of their work center on the publication of patient data and all patients in the study have been sufficiently informed and gave their informed consent in writing to participate in this study.

Metastatic Calcinosis of Aortic Valve Secondary to Renal Failure Mimicking Infective Endocarditis

Inefficient dialysis can cause significant deposition of calcium all over the body, including heart valves making heart function impaired. We illustrate a case of 38-year-old female with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. The patient had been complaining of pain and swelling of the right hand for the last few months and had been seen by hand surgeon and was admitted electively for the biopsy of hand lesions. Before her planned surgery, she developed severe shortness of breath. Urgent echocardiogram revealed severe aortic regurgitation and large vegetation on the aortic valve. Infective endocarditis was suspected but blood cultures were negative for any microorganism and the patient did not meet the Duke criteria. Because of her hemodynamic instability immediate mechanical valve replacement surgery was performed. The pathology report showed extensive calcification and myxoid degeneration. No infectious agent was found. Later on, biopsy of her hand lesions showed extensive calcification with macrophages and giant cells. No atypia or malignancy was identified. This is a rare case of the metastatic calcinosis of aortic valve secondary to renal failure mimicking aortic valve infective endocarditis.A 38-year-old female with past medical history of end stage renal disease secondary to IgA nephropathy on peritoneal dialysis, hypothyroidism, gout, hypertension, and peritonitis presented with painful swellings of both hands more prominent on the right thumb (Figure 1). During the few months before her presentation her calcium was in the range of 7.7 to 9.7 mg/dL and phosphorus in the range of 8.9 to 15.8 mg/dL. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis revealed stone in the right kidney and soft tissue calcification in the hip. Aspiration of the thumb swellings at the time of presentation ruled out gout and showed diffuse deposition of calcium phosphate. X-rays of her hand showed diffuse calcification in the volar aspect of right thumb. She was planned for the removal of these growths under general anesthesia, but one day prior to her procedure she developed severe shortness of breath. Urgent echocardiogram was done which showed severe aortic regurgitation and large vegetation on the aortic valve (Figures 2, 3, and 4). The patient was hemodynamically unstable and therefore urgent surgery for mechanical aortic valve replacement was performed. Pathology report revealed irregular soft tissue calcification on cut surface. Microscopically the specimen was composed of myxoid degeneration with calcification and areas of acute and chronic inflammation. No infectious agent was found. Surgery for her hand lesions was performed after her acute condition settled down. A biopsy was taken and histopathology revealed extensive calcification with macrophages and giant cells. No atypia or malignancy was found.This is a very rare case of metastatic calcinosis secondary to end stage renal disease affecting aortic valve mimicking infective endocarditis.Cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of death in patients with end stage renal disease on dialysis. Left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, myocardial fibrosis, and heart failure are the major cardiovascular complications in renal failure [1]. Valve calcification is a rare sequel of renal failure. Mitral valve is the most common valve affected and it usually manifests as mitral annular calcification (MAC), with aortic valve being the second most common [2]. In rare cases as in our patient a tumor like calcified mass can also arise close to the mitral valve which makes it difficult to distinguish from vegetation [3]. Impaired calcium phosphate metabolism is considered to be the main factor in the pathogenesis of valve calcification. Phosphate levels above 6.5 mg/dL and calcium phosphate product above 72 mg2/dL2 are associated with increased risk of valvular calcification [4]. Other molecules implicated in the pathogenesis are Osteoprotegerin, RANK, RANKL, Fetuin A mineral complexes, and FGF-23/klotho complexes [5]. In our patient phosphate was as high as 15.8 mg/dL and calcium phosphate product was 140.62 mg2/dL2. The use of vitamin D for secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure and calcium containing phosphate binders is associated with net positive calcium balance causing significant contribution in valvular calcification [6].Aortic valve calcification can present as stenosis, regurgitation, or severe insufficiency as in our case. Unlike our patient who presented abruptly with severe aortic regurgitation, usual calcinosis causes chronic progressive regurgitation. Aortic valve calcification can be diagnosed by echocardiography or electron beam computed tomography.The management of valvular calcification in end stage renal disease is a challenge. Prevention is the primary goal of therapy. The importance of calcium and phosphate levels is widely addressed. Dietary phosphate restriction is effective in preventing valvular calcification. Increased dialysis can effectively remove excess phosphorus from the body ameliorating the catastrophe, but nearly all patients require phosphate binders to control phosphate levels. The traditional aluminum and calcium containing phosphate binders are largely replaced by newer agents because of aluminum intoxication and hypercalcemia, respectively. Sevelamer hydrochloride, an iron binding resin has appeared to be effective in reducing phosphate levels [7]. Our patient was on peritoneal dialysis and was noted to have increased phosphate levels up to 15 mg/deal during the last several months before her presentation to the hospital. Increased phosphate and secondary hyperparathyroidism might have put forth extensive metastatic calcification of her aortic valve and caused severe aortic insufficiency for which she needed mechanical aortic valve replacement. This is a very rare complication of renal failure causing significant morbidity and mortality in renal failure patients.End stage renal disease hampers the electrolyte balance, making patients susceptible to complications such as metastatic calcification. These calcifications might mimic features of infective endocarditis making diagnosis and management quite difficult.Our case highlights the devastating aspects of metastatic calcification of aortic valve secondary to end stage renal disease. Efficient dialysis to prevent the unwanted rise of calcium and phosphate is very important. To avoid complications such as metastatic calcification close monitoring of calcium and phosphate is helpful.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Aortic Dissection in a Healthy Male Athlete: A Unique Case with Comprehensive Literature Review
1Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN,  USA2Department of Internal Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN,  USAReceived 11 July 2016; Accepted 29 August 2016Academic Editor: Takatoshi KasaiCopyright © 2016 Balraj Singh et al.

The patient did not have a recent history of trauma to the chest, no history of hypertension, and no illicit drug use. He presented with severe chest pain radiating to back and syncopal event with exertion. Initial vitals were significant for blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg, pulse of 80 beats per minute, respirations of 24 per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Physical exam was significant for elevated jugular venous pressure, muffled heart sounds, and cold extremities with diminished pulses in upper and absent pulses in lower extremities. Bedside echocardiogram showed aortic root dilatation and cardiac tamponade. STAT computed tomography (CT) scan of chest revealed dissection of ascending aorta. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and patient underwent successful repair of ascending aorta. Hemodynamic stress of weightlifting can predispose to aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is a rare but often catastrophic condition if not diagnosed and managed acutely. Although rare, aortic dissection needs to be in the differential when a young weightlifter presents with chest pain as a delay in diagnosis may be fatal.Aortic dissection is a clinical emergency that commonly presents with tearing chest pain and hemodynamic instability. The immediate mortality rate in aortic dissection is as high as 1% per hour over the first several hours, making early diagnosis and treatment critical for survival. Therefore, high index of clinical suspicion is important as delay in diagnosis can have dreadful consequences. Aortic dissection in young healthy individuals has been reported in the literature but is relatively rare. In present review, we report a case of healthy male athlete with heavy weightlifting and use of anabolic steroids. He presented with chest pain in ER and was found to have aortic dissection.A 27-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the hospital with the chief complaint of chest pain. On the day of admission, he went to the gym to lift weights, which he routinely does on a daily basis. During the workout, he developed severe chest pain with radiation to his back. He initially thought that he had pulled his muscle in his chest. After completing his weightlifting workout at the gym, he went to play basketball with his friends and continued to experience ongoing chest pain. On the basketball court, his friends noticed that he was holding his chest, was not feeling well, and reportedly had a syncopal event with exertion earlier in the day, so emergency medical services was called to bring him to the hospital. He described the chest pain as sharp, radiating to the back, and 10/10 in severity. The patient was cold, clammy, and short of breath. Prior to this incident, the patient had been healthy all his life without any medical problems. He never smoked, did not have hypertension, and had no family history of sudden cardiac death or any collagen vascular disease. There was no predisposing risk factor for aortic dissection other than heavy weightlifting. To develop and maintain a muscular body, he recently started injecting intramuscular anabolic steroids for the last 2 months and was going to the gym every day, lifting around 200 pounds at a time.On examination upon arrival to the hospital, the patient’s blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg, pulse was 80 beats per minute, respirations were 24 per minute, and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. He was a well-developed, well-nourished, 5′9′′ muscular young male with a blue discoloration of his lips and extremities. Both upper and lower extremities were cold and clammy. The patient had diminished palpable radial pulses in his upper extremities but no palpable pulse in his lower extremities. His jugular venous pulse was elevated. Auscultation of his heart revealed distant, muffled heart sounds without any murmur. Lungs were clear to auscultation, and the patient was in mild respiratory distress with tachypnea. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was visibly uncomfortable, restless, and moaning in pain.The patient’s EKG revealed sinus tachycardia, nonspecific T-wave inversion in leads V4–V6, and voltage criteria suggesting LVH (Figure 1). The chest X-ray revealed clear lungs with cardiomegaly and a wide mediastinum (Figure 2). A STAT bedside echocardiogram was remarkable for moderate to severe left ventricular hypertrophy and a large circumferential pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade and aortic root dilatation measured as 4.6 cm (Figure 3). A chest computed tomography (CT) immediately followed by echocardiogram revealed an ascending aorta measured as 5.7 cm in diameter with an aortic dissection suggesting rapid expansion of the dissection. Hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade were present with 2 cm thick fluid in the pericardium (Figures 4 and 5).A STAT cardiothoracic surgery consultation was done, and the patient was emergently taken to the operating room where a 28 mm Hemashield interposition aortic graft was placed. The aortic dissection had extended to the noncoronary cusp without involvement of the left main or right coronary arteries. It was challenging to repair the noncoronary cusp and keep the native valve intact. Intraoperatively, it was thought that the aortic regurgitation was acceptable given his age and to avoid lifelong anticoagulant for this young patient. Although the patient’s initial echocardiogram prior to surgery showed no aortic regurgitation, the echocardiogram performed following the emergent repair of the ascending aortic dissection showed severe aortic regurgitation (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)). The patient’s hospital course was complicated by persistent severe aortic regurgitation requiring a second procedure to repair the native aortic valve. Following the second surgical procedure, the patient’s severe aortic regurgitation was minimized to moderate aortic regurgitation without necessitating aortic replacement. Both surgeries were successful for the patient. Pathology of the aortic specimen revealed cystic medial degenerative changes, which represent a loss of elastic fibers in the aortic media and atherosclerotic changes of aortic intima.Aortic dissection is a fatal condition with high morbidity and mortality. True incidence of this condition is usually underestimated due to the unknown contribution of aortic dissection to sudden deaths that occur out of the hospital setting as well as epidemiological studies of aortic dissection relying on collecting data retrospectively from hospital based registries. Reported incidence is 16 per 100,000 men and 7–9 per 100,000 women with the mean age at presentation of 63 years [1–3].There is a genetic predisposition for aortic dissection in cases of Marfan, Loey-Dietz, and Ehler-Danlos syndromes, familial aneurysms, bicuspid aortic valve, and coarctation of the aorta. Apart from genetics, the most common risk factors contributing to aortic dissection include hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, illicit drugs including cocaine and amphetamine, inflammatory disorders such as Takayasu, Behcet, and giant-cell arteritis, and trauma to the chest wall [4].The pathology of aortic dissection is not completely understood. Cystic medial degeneration is a noninflammatory loss of elastic fibers in the aortic media, and it is not pathognomonic for any of the abovementioned etiologies of dissection. Dissection usually starts with an intimal tear and is not always aneurysmal initially [5, 6]. Intramural hematoma and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer can cause aortic dissection as well. Elevated blood pressure further propagates the intimal tear precipitating aortic dissection [5, 6].Chest pain with radiation to the back is the most common complaint of a patient with aortic dissection, which was the initial presentation of the patient in this case report. Clinical scenarios for patients with aortic dissection may vary and can be challenging to diagnose depending upon the location of aortic dissection as the location dictates which other arteries and structures may also be affected. During an aortic dissection, there may be involvement of side branches of the aorta, which may cause malperfusion of the brain leading to a cerebral vascular accident, decrease blood to the heart muscle producing a myocardial infarction, or can involve adjacent structures and valves which may cause cardiac tamponade or aortic regurgitation. CT angiography scan is the preferred modality for diagnosis [7], and Transesophageal Echocardiogram may be needed if the patient is unstable or is not able to be transferred for a CT scan. Magnetic resonance angiography is another good alternative modality.Surgical treatment is recommended for Type A dissection. Overall in-hospital mortality is around 25%, and mortality for medically managed patients is 58%. Mortality is 1-2% per hour for the first day in patients who do not qualify for surgery [3, 7]. Surgery involves the placement of a synthetic interposition graft to reconstitute the true lumen. Surgery may or may not involve reimplantation of coronary arteries and resuspension of the native aortic valve, depending upon the level of dissection. Resuspension of the native aortic valve is preferred to replacement of the valve if possible [8].Aortic dissection in younger individuals is very rare. Excluding the patient discussed in this case study, as per our knowledge, there are only a few reported cases of aortic dissection in weightlifters with a history of anabolic steroid use, and one of these cases also had a history of cocaine and heroin use. The following list summarizes the six reported cases of aortic dissection in male weightlifters less than 38 years old [9–12].Brief Summary of Reported Cases of Male Weightlifters Less Than 38 Years Old Who Presented with Aortic DissectionType I Aortic Dissection(1)22 yo: no hypertension and unreported history of anabolic steroid use [11].(2)37 yo: with hypertension and with a history of anabolic steroid use [11].(3)37 yo: with hypertension, with a history of anabolic steroid use, and with history of cocaine and heroin use [11].(4)34 yo: no hypertension and with a history of anabolic steroid use [12].Type II Aortic Dissection 28 yo: no hypertension, no anabolic steroid use, and no atherosclerosis [9].Type III Aortic Dissection 18 yo: no hypertension, no anabolic steroid use, and no atherosclerosis [10].Pathology reports of all cases included cystic medial degeneration of the aortic tissue. Only the patient presented in this case report had pathology that also included atherosclerotic changes of aortic intima. This was the only patient with known current active anabolic steroid use at the time of aortic dissection.Aortic dissection is categorized based on the location and origin of the dissection. Dissection of the ascending and descending aorta is defined as Type A and Type B dissection, respectively, as per Stanford classification. Aortic dissection is also classified as Types I to III as per DeBakey classification based on origination of the dissection. Type I aortic dissection has its origin in the ascending aorta and expands distally to the aortic arch and beyond the descending aorta. Type II aortic dissection originates in the ascending aorta where it remains confined without propagation beyond the ascending aorta. Type III aortic dissection has its origin in the descending aorta and expands distally [13]. All of the reported cases seen in the previous list are of aortic dissection in patients less than 38 years old who were active weightlifters with no genetic predisposition to development of aortic dissection, and pathology reports demonstrated cystic medial degeneration of the dissected aortic tissue in each case [9–12].Our patient has been using anabolic steroids chronically that might be a contributing factor to aortic dissection but there is no clear association found between use of anabolic steroids and aortic root dilatation and dissection in the literature. More importantly he was likely having underlying mild aortic enlargement that concomitant with hemodynamic changes of heavy weightlifting raised aortic wall stress to a level that begets aortic dissection. Of the five reported cases of Type I aortic dissection in male weightlifters less than 38 years old, four of the patients confirmed use of anabolic steroids and the fifth patient had no known history of anabolic steroid use. Interestingly there are no reports of aortic dissection in anabolic steroids users that are not weightlifters. In the opposite there are quite a few reports of aortic dissection in weightlifters that do not use anabolic steroids. More importantly the pathological analysis does not suggest any scientifically proven relationship of steroids and atherosclerosis or of anabolic steroids and aortic dilatation or anabolic steroids and aortic dissection. Anabolic steroids theoretically could increase a patient’s low density lipoprotein and decrease high density lipoprotein, thus promoting atherosclerotic deposition of the aortic intima and leading to weakening of the aortic wall. Therefore, atherosclerotic aortic walls are prone to dissection and rupture [9, 11]. The one Type II and one Type III aortic dissection cases did not have histories of anabolic steroid use. Although this case study shows that there is a correlation between anabolic steroid use and Type I aortic dissection in young male weightlifters, aortic dissection in this population is so rare that it is difficult to prove direct causation of anabolic steroid use leading to Type I aortic dissection. Weightlifting is known to elicit profound hemodynamic stress on the walls of the aorta [11], and weightlifting alone even without anabolic steroids use may predispose young patients to aortic dissection, particularly Type I aortic dissection. Although aortic dissection in this age group is very rare, it needs to be considered as a possible differential diagnosis in younger patients who are weightlifters with or without history of anabolic steroid use as the mortality and fatal morbidity are very high if left untreated [9].The patient presented in this case had moderate to severe ventricular hypertrophy, which is difficult to explain in the absence of long standing hypertension. Anabolic steroid use may be the cause of his ventricular hypertrophy. A dilemma faced in the operating room for this patient was how to fix the aortic valve as the aortic dissection involved the noncoronary cusp. In this situation, the aortic valve could have been either replaced or repaired. Replacing the aortic valve would have committed this young patient to a lifetime anticoagulation therapy. On the other hand, repairing the noncoronary cusp would not require anticoagulants, but there would continue to be an acceptable degree of aortic regurgitation that has a potential to worsen over time, which was the initial option selected for this patient. Prior to aortic valve repair, the patient had severe aortic regurgitation, which was minimized to moderate aortic regurgitation following aortic valve repair, and the patient continues to remain asymptomatic to present day. He will likely need an aortic valve replacement in the future if he becomes symptomatic. The patient has been followed up as an outpatient with serial echocardiograms to reassess the degree of aortic regurgitation. He was strongly encouraged to avoid weightlifting and all anabolic steroid use. He continues to take lisinopril as an outpatient to decrease his afterload and therefore mitigate the effects of aortic regurgitation. He would have also been started on metoprolol had he not been bradycardic. He has been able to return to aerobic exercise without recurrence of symptoms and is seen regularly in the outpatient cardiology clinic.The authors do not have any conflict of interests.
Pseudopheochromocytoma Associated with Domestic Assault
1Department of General Internal Medicine, Centres Hospitaliers Jolimont, Nivelles,  Belgium2Intensive Care Unit, Centres Hospitaliers Jolimont, Nivelles,  BelgiumReceived 6 July 2016; Accepted 28 August 2016Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2016 H. M. Le et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Pseudopheochromocytoma has a clinical presentation that is similar to pheochromocytoma. It manifests itself with paroxysmal hypertension crises, associated with various symptoms such as headaches, chest pain, nausea, palpitations, and dizziness. Patients are usually asymptomatic in between the crises. Unlike pheochromocytoma, there is no catecholamines overproduction in this pathology: hypertensive peaks are caused by a hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system, which is often triggered by a psychological trauma in the past. Treatment of pseudopheochromocytoma can be challenging due to normal blood pressure values in between the hypertensive peaks; it includes alpha- and beta-blockers for moderate crises and prevention and must be combined with psychopharmacologic agents such as anxiolytics or antidepressant drugs. Psychotherapy and dietetic treatment are also crucial in pseudopheochromocytoma management.Severe and symptomatic paroxysmal hypertension always induces suspicion of pheochromocytoma. However, Kuchel described patients with paroxysmal hypertension without catecholamines overproduction [1]. This entity called “pseudopheochromocytoma” is characterized by paroxysmal and abrupt onset of hypertension with symptoms (headache, chest pain, dizziness, nausea, flushing, and palpitations) which is not induced by fear or panic [2]. Moreover in the majority of cases, a past history of severe emotional trauma is found such as physical or psychological violence [2]. We report a case and review the literature about this entity.A 45-year-old woman was referred to the Emergency Unit by the cardiologist for management and investigation of symptomatic severe hypertension. At admission, blood pressure was high at 190/130 mmHg. Heart rate was normal at 78 bpm. The clinical examination was unremarkable. There was no evidence of aortic dissection and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure stabilization.Prior to admission, the patient was seen for the first time by cardiologist because she suffered from symptomatic hypertension with headaches, scotoma, tinnitus, epistaxis, paresthesia in the upper limbs, and dizziness lasting for 4 months. The episodes occurred several times per month but were more frequent of late and tended to happen every 2 days, lasting from a few minutes to an hour. The patient felt well between those episodes except for fatigue. She had been taking a combined antihypertensive drug (angiotensin-conversion enzyme inhibitor with diuretics) for 3 days prescribed by her general practitioner.Diagnosis of hypertension was established by her GP, confirmed by blood pressure self-measurement, which showed systolic pressure up to 180 mmHg and diastolic pressure up to 80 mmHg. The patient also had palpitations and tachycardia up to 147 per minute.The patient had no major medical history, although she had depression when her first husband died from a car accident 20 years ago, leaving her in charge of a small child. She has now remarried and had 2 other children. She explained that her son from her first husband had psychological issues and drinking addiction; when drunk, he could be verbally and physically violent towards her. She confessed that her son tried to stab her 4 months ago and went to jail after that event. She had recently started seeing him again but was very anxious during their meetings. She did not drink alcohol but usually smoked a few cigarettes on social occasions. She did not use illicit drugs and did not drink coffee regularly.Biological results were strictly normal. There was no renal impairment. Hormone determination showed no evidence for secondary hypertension causes such as hypercorticism, hyperthyroidism, hyperaldosteronism, carcinoid tumour, or pheochromocytoma (Table 1). Plasmatic adrenaline and noradrenaline levels were within the normal range but urinary vanillylmandelic acid and urinary normetanephrine levels were slightly high (with, resp., 29.1 mg/24 h (1.8–6.7) and 289 micrograms/g creatinine (46–256)). Urinary catecholamine tests were repeated a few days thereafter and returned to normal.Cardiac assessment by echocardiography and electrocardiogram was normal; there was no sign of hypertrophy or cavity dilatation, and cardiac output was normal. Cerebral scan revealed no lesion.An abdominal CT scan was performed and showed no renal artery stenosis or adrenal mass.Clinical evolution was satisfactory: blood pressure was well controlled by intravenous nicardipine in the first place and then by oral antihypertensive drugs afterwards (ACE inhibitor associated with calcium antagonist). Headaches were treated with simple painkillers. The patient was transferred to the Internal Medicine ward after 5 days spent in the ICU.Fundoscopic examination of the eye revealed no retinopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was normal. 123MIBG-scintigraphy was performed and ruled out the existence of adrenal or ectopic secreting mass.During hospitalization, we observed recurring paroxysmal hypertension crises at 210/120 mmHg despite the treatment. Beta-blockers and diuretics were added to the initial treatment but had little effect. The patient had hypertensive peaks at 240/150 mmHg and subsequently developed a seizure due to a hypertensive encephalopathy; she was readmitted in the ICU for 5 days. It must be noted that there was no orthostatic hypotension.After excluding every cause of secondary hypertension, pseudopheochromocytoma was the most likely diagnosis for paroxysmal hypertension without evidence of catecholamine excess or organ damage and often appears with an underlying psychological context. Emotional instability can trigger hypertension peaks, which mimic clinical manifestations of pheochromocytoma, even though patients are not aware of their psychological issues.Adequate treatment was started with alpha- and beta-blockers, combined with anxiolytics and psychological support. Hypertensive crises rapidly resolved after several days and the patient was discharged after normalization of blood pressure.Two weeks later, the patient was readmitted in the ICU for tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness. At admission, Glasgow Coma Scale was assessed at 3/15 and systolic blood pressure was of 220 mmHg. Electroencephalogram and cerebral scan were normal. Artificial ventilation was needed for a few hours. The patient recovered quickly and was transferred the day after to the General Internal Medicine Unit. The patient recognized afterwards that she had not taken the medication properly at home. Importance of treatment and psychological follow-up was explained again to the patient before discharge. She was seen at medical visit 3 weeks after hospitalization: the patient is now under a psychologist’s care, she has no symptoms anymore, and blood pressure is within normal range, which allows progressive decrease of antihypertensive drug doses.Causes of catecholamines excess include pheochromocytoma, stress, medications, and ingestion of cocaine or amphetamines [3]. The presence of paroxysmal hypertension almost always raises the possibility of a pheochromocytoma and patients with negative evaluation often get labelled with a diagnosis of pseudopheochromocytoma [1].Clinically, hypertension episodes are usually sudden in onset and are often accompanied by physical symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea, diaphoresis, chest pain, and palpitations [2] which are indistinguishable from the symptoms observed in a patient with pheochromocytoma. Frequency of these episodes ranges from daily to less than one per month and the duration of the episodes may range from minutes to days [4]. In their series of 21 patients, Mann found that women are more often affected than men [2] and that the majority of patients had 1–3 attacks per week. The most frequent symptoms were chest pain (80%) followed by light-headedness (68%), headache (68%), nausea, and diaphoresis (62%). Pseudopheochromocytoma is usually described in White Caucasians but case report in Black African is also reported [5].Some cases had been associated with obstructive sleep apnea [6] or anxiolytic withdrawal [7]. Focal neurological symptoms such as lateralizing sensorimotor deficits were reported in one case [8].Frequently, a history of psychological trauma is found as in our case. Indeed, four months before admission, the patient’s son, under alcohol influence, tried to stab her. The father of her son died in a car accident when he was 25 and her son began to drink some years later. She had depression at that time.Psychological history includes physical and verbal abuse in childhood [8]. In the series reported by Mann, 67% of patients had a history of severe emotional trauma [2] including physical child abuse or, in another case, the patient said that her son became paraplegic after a nearly fatal automobile crash. As in our case, patients harboured no distressing trauma-related emotions suggestive of emotional defences.The differential diagnoses are reported as follows: Labile hypertension: patients are able to identify a clear emotional or stressful stimulus for blood pressure elevation Panic disorder: pressure elevation is usually not as high, characterized by episodes of fear that begin abruptly and not always expected or triggered Drug abuse: cocaine, amphetamine, or monoamine oxydase inhibitor Isolated adrenal medullary hyperplasia: increased uptake in iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine radioisotopeLabile hypertension differs starkly from paroxysmal hypertension in the clear relationship between blood pressure elevation and stress or emotional distress. Panic disorder is characterized by existence of trigger such as fear or panic, and blood pressure elevation is generally mild. The common point between these entities is the existence of emotions that are repressed from conscious awareness, and both respond to treatment with antidepressant drugs.Despite the fact that there is no generally accepted definition of stress-related disorders, it was ruled out by psychologist and psychiatrist. The patient did not present dissociative symptoms (no feeling numb or detached, no derealization, no depersonalization, and no dissociative amnesia). Moreover there was no reexperience of the trauma event.Pathogenesis of pseudopheochromocytoma is poorly understood but is thought to be a result of hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system [3]. Patients with pseudopheochromocytoma appear to have an amplified cardiovascular responsiveness to catecholamines and an enhanced adrenal release of epinephrine in response to sympathetic nervous stimulation. Kuchel [1] identified elevated dopamine levels as a marker of sympathetic nervous system activation in pseudopheochromocytoma. In a study of 11 patients with pseudopheochromocytoma, Sharabi et al. [9] found normal baseline plasma concentrations or norepinephrine but higher baseline plasma concentrations of epinephrine and metanephrine. Moreover, these patients had a 6-fold larger increase in plasma epinephrine after stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system with glucagon. Hamada et al. [10] demonstrated increased blood pressure reactivity in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma compared with pheochromocytoma.In their case report on a patient presenting pseudopheochromocytoma associated with obstructive sleep apnea, Cheezum and Lettieri [6] observed normal value of epinephrine but elevation of total metanephrines and normetanephrine with normalization after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.Treatment of this condition can be challenging, as blood pressure may be normal in between episodes of high blood pressure. Antihypertensive drugs, psychopharmacologic agents, and psychological interventions are cornerstone of the treatment. Severe elevation of blood pressure may require intravenous drugs such as labetalol or nicardipine. Oral labetalol is less preferred because of the unpredictable bioavailability [11]. Alpha- and beta-blockers are the treatment of choice in case of moderate crisis [2]. Preventive management of blood elevation includes beta-blockers or alpha-blockers. Combination treatment has not been assessed in a controlled trial. Psychopharmacologic agents include rapidly acting anxiolytics, such as Alprazolam [12, 13]. Antidepressant drugs are effective in decreasing the frequency of blood pressure elevation even in patients who do not acknowledge an emotional trigger for these paroxysms [2]. Psychological interventions are also important by reassuring the patients that hypertensive paroxysms are unlikely to cause a sudden cardiovascular event in the absence of extreme blood pressure elevation. In the series published by Mann [2], 3 patients responded to psychological intervention alone without requiring any pharmacological treatment. Despite the absence of randomized trial in pseudopheochromocytoma, nonpharmacologic strategies must be used such as exercise, limiting alcohol consumption, weight loss, and smoking cessation [14]. Meditation merits consideration [15, 16]. Music was also demonstrated effective in some trials [17, 18].The authors do not have competing interests regarding this manuscript.
An Obstructed Anomalous Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery Arising from the Right Coronary Artery Requiring Surgical Intervention
Department of Cardiovascular Disease, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY 11203,  USAReceived 7 June 2016; Accepted 21 August 2016Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2016 Alexander Mironov et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 47-year-old female presented to our hospital with symptoms of stable angina. Cardiac catheterization revealed a rare coronary artery anomaly of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery branching off the right coronary artery ostium. Furthermore, the anomalous LAD artery exhibited significant atherosclerotic obstruction. Our review of the literature found only nine such previously described cases. Due to the unique nature of coronary artery anomalies and their complications, we would like to contribute our case to the medical literature.Anomalies of the coronary arteries are a rare finding, with most being discovered incidentally and having no effect on quality of life. Nevertheless, a small percentage of patients who do develop symptoms are at especially great risk for cardiac complications. We would like to present a case in which a middle age female develops anginal symptoms and is found to have a rare congenital coronary artery anomaly (CCAA) of the LAD artery, requiring surgical intervention. Our subsequent discussion will highlight the epidemiology of such anomalies, their consequences, and a brief approach to management.A 47-year-old African American female presented with worsening angina over a one-week course. Her chest pain was centrally located and exacerbated by activity. At presentation, it had worsened to Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class IV and now radiating to both arms. She denied respiratory symptoms and palpitations. Her medical history was significant for menorrhagia related anemia (Hb 11.7) and a pulmonary embolism (PE) ten years earlier, attributed to oral contraceptive use. Family history was negative for heart disease or sudden cardiac death. She was a recreational smoker ten years previously and currently denies toxic habits.The patient was evaluated for Acute Coronary Syndrome in the emergency department. ECG (see Figure 1) showed normal sinus rhythm, mild ST depressions in leads V3-V4, and T wave inversions in V1 and V2, suggestive of possible anteroseptal ischemia. Her troponin I peaked at 0.67 ng/mL and BNP was 175 pg/mL. Assessment was negative for hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. CT chest angiography showed no signs of PE. She was given aspirin 325 mg, clopidogrel 300 mg, and enoxaparin 1 mg/kg for NSTEMI treatment and admitted to the cardiac service.The following morning, our patient underwent left heart cardiac catheterization which revealed single vessel disease with a 99% diffuse obstruction of the LAD artery. Furthermore, the LAD artery had a very rare anomalous origin from the ostium of the right coronary artery (RCA). The LAD artery then crossed the myocardium and descended towards the apex along the interventricular groove (see Figures 2 and 3). Meanwhile, the left coronary artery gave rise only to the circumflex artery (see Figure 4). The ostial RCA itself was noted to have a 30% obstruction. Additional findings included right dominant coronary circulation, a 20–30% ostial obstruction of the left main coronary artery, and mildly depressed left ventricle (LV) function with anterolateral hypokinesis and an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. Lastly, the mitral valve (MV) was observed to have moderate to severe regurgitation and mild to moderate thickening of the anterior MV leaflet with no stenosis, as confirmed by transesophageal echocardiogram.A decision was made to not pursue percutaneous coronary intervention due to potential for compromise of a very large RCA ostium. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery service. She underwent successful left internal mammary artery to LAD artery graft and MV repair with annuloplasty ring. Postoperative course was uneventful with mechanical ventilation and vasopressor agents being discontinued on the first postoperative day. Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) ten days after presentation demonstrated normalized LV EF of 55% and only mild MV regurgitation. After a twelve-day hospital course, our patient was discharged home in stable condition with scheduled follow-up. Her outpatient medication regimen included aspirin 325 mg daily, atenolol 50 mg twice daily, enalapril 5 mg twice daily, atorvastatin 20 mg daily, and furosemide 40 mg daily.Congenital coronary artery anomalies are a rare phenomenon. The incidence in the general population ranges from 0.24% to 2.33%, with the largest known study reporting 1.3% [1, 7–10]. A single anomalous LAD artery originating from the RCA, as found in our patient, is further scarce and we are aware of only nine such cases described in the literature (see Table 1) [1–6]. These cases are distinct from another anomaly which may involve an LAD artery branching off the RCA called the Type IV “Dual LAD” artery whose incidence ranges from 0.01 to 0.03% [11, 12]. In comparison, more prevalent anomalies of the LAD artery include separate origin from the circumflex artery at the left sinus of valsalva or at the right sinus of valsalva, respectively, accounting for 30.4% and 2.3% of CCAAs [7].In addition to being able to identify CCAAs, it is important to understand their consequences. The majority are discovered incidentally and up to 81% are considered benign with no clinical significance. Meanwhile, those that are malignant have the potential to cause cardiac ischemia, especially during times of exertion and increased myocardial oxygen demand. This may lead to angina, syncope, cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death (SCD) [7]. In fact, coronary anomalies are the second leading cause of SCD in athletes at 19%, after hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at 36% [13].Anatomic characteristics that make a CCAA malignant include (1) single coronary artery, (2) origin from the pulmonary artery, (3) origin from the opposite aortic sinus, (4) passing between the aorta and pulmonary artery, (5) passing intramurally, (6) acute-angle takeoff resulting in a slitlike orifice, and (7) small artery due to ostial stenosis or atresia. Furthermore, myocardial squeezing, vasospasm, and the development of atherosclerosis, as in our case, of the anomalous artery all have the potential to cause clinical symptoms [1, 3, 7, 14].Management of anomalous arteries requires careful consideration. If a patient is identified to have a symptomatic malignant CCAA, corrective surgery is warranted. The difficulty occurs when asymptomatic patients are discovered to have a malignant CCAA. Due to the overall rarity of SCD, especially over the ages of 30–35, some may recommend avoiding surgery [15]. Meanwhile, atherosclerotic lesions may be treated with percutaneous stenting if the coronary anatomy is amenable to instrumentation [4, 5]. Otherwise, as in the case above, a bypass graft may be used. Lastly, while there is no known pattern of genetic inheritance of CCAAs, some authors have suggested screening at risk family members with TTE [16, 17].While the incidence of CCAAs is low in the general population, anomalies with malignant characteristics have the potential for deadly consequences. The risks and benefits of intervention must be weighed, requiring a multidisciplinary approach with input from cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery specialists. In the case presented, an atherosclerotic anomalous LAD artery branching off the RCA combined with significant MV regurgitation necessitated a surgical approach.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this article.
Successful Intravascular Ultrasound-Guided Transradial Coronary Intervention with a 4Fr Guiding Catheter

The small diameter of the 4Fr guiding catheter has limited the use of several angioplasty devices such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in the past. However, the combination of a novel IVUS catheter and a 0.010 guidewire makes it possible to perform IVUS-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a 4Fr guiding catheter. We herein report the case of a 51-year-old man with silent myocardial ischemia who underwent IVUS-guided transradial PCI with a 4Fr guiding catheter.Minimizing the catheter size can reduce vascular access complications and contrast dye usage in coronary angiography (CAG) [1]. Intravascular ultrasound- (IVUS-) guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with significantly lower rates of adverse clinical events compared with angiography-guided PCI [2]. Although the small diameter of a 4Fr guiding catheter has several critical limitations in the use of angioplasty devices such as IVUS, the combination of a novel IVUS catheter and a 0.010 guidewire may make it possible to perform IVUS-guided PCI with a 4Fr guiding catheter.A 51-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction 1 month previously, and emergent coronary angiography revealed in-stent restenosis in the distal right coronary artery and severe stenosis of the proximal portion of the second diagonal branch (D2). In-stent restenosis was the culprit lesion and was treated with a drug-coated balloon. One month later, the patient was readmitted to our hospital for elective PCI to the D2 lesion (Figure 1). A 4Fr BL3.5 guiding catheter (KIWAMI Heartrail, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was used to engage the left coronary artery and a 0.010 inch guidewire (Decillion HS, Asahi Intecc, Aichi, Japan) was advanced across stenosis into the distal D2. An IVUS catheter (OptiCross®, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) was passed smoothly in the 4Fr guiding catheter and the D2 lesion. IVUS images demonstrated that the stenotic lesion was an eccentric fibrous plaque with superficial calcium. After predilation of the lesion with a 2.5 × 15 mm scoring balloon (Scoreflex, OrbusNeich, Hong Kong, China), a 3.0 × 16 mm everolimus-eluting stent (Promus Premier, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) was deployed successfully in the D2 lesion. IVUS images revealed incomplete apposition of the stent struts in the proximal edge (Figure 2); therefore, post-dilation of the stent proximal edge was performed using a 3.5 × 8 mm noncompliant balloon (Powered Lacrosse 2, Goodman, Aichi, Japan) at a maximum of 16 atm. The final IVUS findings revealed that the apposition of the stent strut was improved (Figure 3), and final angiography showed good results (Figure 4).TRI can reduce vascular access complications and contrast dye usage in coronary angiography [3]. However, radial artery diameters can vary widely from 1.5 to 4 mm [4], and a large-sized catheter for patients with small radial arteries may cause radial artery occlusion [5]. Thus, the small profile of the catheter, especially <6Fr catheters, referred to as slender PCI, has a favorable impact on vascular access complications [6].A 4Fr guiding catheter has been developed to facilitate TRI [7]. However, a 4Fr guiding catheter does not allow successful passage of an IVUS catheter because the inner diameter of 4Fr guiding catheters is limited to 0.050 inches. Recently, a novel IVUS catheter (OptiCross) with a thinner profile has become available. The shaft diameter of the IVUS catheter is 0.0394 inches, and the exit port diameter is 0.0413 inches; thus, the IVUS catheter enables us to use a 4Fr guiding catheter in combination with a 0.010 guidewire (Figure 5). Slender TRI with the 4Fr guiding catheter is less invasive, and moreover, IVUS guidance can be achieved safely and reliably for patients with coronary artery disease. Additionally, we can apply this method to the 4-in-5 mother-child technique for treatment of complex coronary lesions [8]. Slender PCI with a 5Fr guiding catheter is becoming widespread in use; however, one of the critical disadvantages of 5Fr guiding catheters is insufficient backup; thus, it is difficult to use the technique for some complex lesions. The 4Fr double-coaxial technique (mother-child technique) is one of the solutions to overcome the problem of backup, and the method in this report further supports the use of IVUS in addition to the 4-in-5 mother-child technique for slender PCI in the treatment of complex coronary lesions.There are several limitations associated with this method. First, the only currently available IVUS catheter for this method is OptiCross due to the limitation of the catheter diameter. Other IVUS catheters are too large to pass through the inner lumen of the 4Fr guiding catheter. Second, a 0.010 guidewire has decreased torque and support; however, the contemporary types of this wire have similar operability to conventional 0.014 guidewires. Third, this method does not allow the IVUS marking technique, which is a way to obtain the optimal angiographic view for stent deployment and appropriate making of the exact position of interest by using IVUS transducer. At present, this method is limited to the selected case. Fourth, the novel introducer sheath of the 5Fr Glidesheath Slender (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) may be an alternative method to 4Fr PCI. The sheath has the same inner lumen size as that of a conventional 5Fr sheath, combined with an outer diameter similar to that of a conventional 4Fr sheath [9]. However, the Glidesheath Slender is not available in some countries and more costly compared with conventional introducer sheaths.The combination of a novel IVUS catheter and a 0.010 guidewire makes it possible to perform IVUS-guided PCI with a 4Fr guiding catheter. This method enables less invasive and safer TRI for patients with coronary artery disease.The authors declare no competing interests.Yasuhiro Nakano did the cardiac catheterization and intervention and Kenji Sadamatsu also participated in the treatment of this patient.The authors appreciate the support and collaboration of our catheterization laboratory staff and the member of the Slender Club Japan, and also acknowledge Dr. Fuminobu Yoshimachi (Associate Professor, Tokai University School of Medicine) and Koji Sugawara (ME, Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital) for their helpful suggestions.
Interventricular Septal Hematoma and Coronary-Ventricular Fistula: A Complication of Retrograde Chronic Total Occlusion Intervention

Here we report two cases of interventricular septal hematoma and coronary-cameral fistula development after right coronary artery (RCA) CTO-PCI using a retrograde approach. Both were complicated by development of ST-segment elevation and chest pain. One case was managed actively and the other conservatively, both with a favorable outcome.Interventricular septal hematoma is a rare complication of retrograde chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with a typically benign course [1]. Here we report two cases of interventricular septal hematoma and coronary-cameral fistula development after right coronary artery (RCA) CTO-PCI using a retrograde approach. Both cases were complicated by the development of ST-segment elevation and chest pain. One case was managed actively with exclusion of the hematoma and the other conservatively, both with a favorable outcome. These cases with clues from seven other case reports have led us to a suggested observation and treatment algorithm for this unique procedural complication.A 46-year-old female with Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class IV angina symptom despite maximal medical therapy was referred for coronary angiogram and was found to have right coronary artery (RCA) chronic total occlusion (CTO) (Figure 1(a)).RCA CTO percutaneous intervention was performed using right radial and right femoral artery dual catheter approach. The RCA was engaged with 6 French Judkins right guide catheter; the right femoral artery was cannulated with a 6 French sheath and the left main was engaged with a 6 French XB 3.5 guide catheter. With standard antegrade wire escalation technique, the CTO could not be crossed [2]. The treatment strategy was changed to the retrograde approach utilizing septal collaterals from the left anterior descending artery (LAD) (Figure 1(b)). A fielder FC guidewire (Asahi Intecc, Nagoya, Japan) was advanced through the second septal perforator and then into the distal RCA (Figure 1(c)). This was followed by advancement of a Corsair catheter (Asahi Intecc, Nagoya, Japan) into the distal RCA. A Pilot 200 (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, Illinois) was advanced through the Corsair and crossed the CTO segment into the antegrade guide catheter followed by Corsair advancement into the guide. An R350 guidewire (Vascular Solutions, Minneapolis, Minnesota) was used for externalization (Figure 1(d)) and three drug-eluting stents were delivered.After removal of retrograde Corsair and guidewire, angiogram of the LAD and RCA revealed Ellis Type III cavity spilling perforation of the second septal branch into the right ventricle (RV) (Figures 1(e) and 1(f)). The patient was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable and therefore transferred to a monitored bed. Subsequently, she complained of intermittent chest pain throughout the night and had sinus tachycardia with normal blood pressure.The next morning, she was taken back to the cardiac catheterization lab and repeat coronary angiography appeared unchanged. Given the patient’s symptom and tachycardia, the decision to proceed with exclusion of the septal artery to RV perforation was made. Bilateral femoral access was obtained and similar guide catheters were used to engage the left and right coronary systems. The perforated collateral septal branch was accessed with workhorse type coronary guidewires from the LAD and RCA. Corsairs were then advanced into the proximal segment of the collateral vessel and negative suction was applied for approximately ten minutes (Figure 1(g)). This maneuver was successful in resolving the perforation from the LAD but not from the RCA side. Therefore, a Renegade Microcatheter (Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts) was advanced from the RCA into the perforated septal branch and a 2 × 3 × 23 mm complex helical Interlock detachable coil (Boston Scientific) was delivered but was ineffective (Figure 1(h)). An attempt to deliver another coil failed due to poor microcatheter support and, therefore, a 2.8 × 19 mm Graftmaster covered stent (Abbott Vascular) was deployed across the perforated collateral vessel in the posterior descending artery of the RCA (Figure 1(i)). Final angiograms of the left and right coronary system confirmed complete resolution of the perforation (Figures 1(j) and 1(k)). The patient’s chest pain and tachycardia resolved after the procedure and she was subsequently discharged home.A 66-year-old male with known coronary artery disease and a chronically occluded mid right coronary stent presented with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The culprit lesion was the RCA proximal to the remotely deployed and chronically occluded bare metal stent resulting in right ventricular ischemia. An attempt to recanalize the RCA was unsuccessful. He was treated medically but had persistent Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class III angina and was referred for RCA CTO-PCI.The antegrade approach was unsuccessful because the wire repeatedly tracked beside the stent; therefore, the retrograde approach was used. The in-stent lesion was successfully crossed with reverse cart technique in the proximal RCA [8]. The RCA was then stented with 2.5 × 38 mm, 3.0 × 38 mm, 3.5 × 38 mm, and 3.5 × 8 mm drug-eluting stents from distal to proximal, respectively. TIMI 3 flow was achieved after procedure.On the night after his PCI, he developed severe chest pain, anterior ST-segment elevation, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (Figure 2(a)). Repeat angiography showed patent RCA stents and a perforation with large septal hematoma formation in the first septal artery branch territory (Figure 2(b)). He was treated conservatively with beta blockers and analgesics.The following day, a contrast enhanced transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed a new large interventricular hematoma. The end systolic dimensions were 5.3 × 2.6 cm (Figure 3(a)). There was a 5 mm diameter fistulous tract from the left ventricle that appeared to extend to within a few millimeters of the right ventricular cavity (Figure 3(b)). Serial echocardiography revealed no appreciable change in the hematoma and fistula. There was no further arrhythmia and right heart catheterization with oximetry showed a Qp/Qs of 1.1 : 1. The patient was discharged on hospital day four.Ten days after PCI he was clinically stable and angina-free. An echocardiogram revealed a smaller intramyocardial septal hematoma (3.6 × 1.3 cm) with a fistulous tract in the septum that entered the apical right ventricle. At 3 months a subsequent echocardiogram showed resolution of the interventricular septal hematoma (Figure 4) and the patient remained symptom-free.CTO-PCI frequency is increasing [9]. In a recent meta-analysis including 26 studies, use of the retrograde approach was associated with a technical success rate of 74.5% (overall CTO-PCI procedural success rate was 83.3%). Typical procedural major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including mortality (0.7%), urgent CABG (0.7%), and stroke (0.5%) were described. CTO specific complications such as collateral perforation occurred in 6.9% of cases with tamponade occurring in 1.4% [10].Septal collateral perforation and hematoma formation is a rare complication after retrograde CTO-PCI [1] and believed to have a typically benign course especially among asymptomatic cases. Here we present two cases where clinical deterioration led to further evaluation and subsequent intervention in one but not the other. In both cases there were no adverse sequelae but aggressive management led to additional treatment with coils and a covered stent while conservative management led to prolonged inpatient observation and additional imaging. Other individual case reports of septal hematoma after retrograde CTO-PCI exist (Table 1). In most of the reported cases, cardiac imaging such as contrast and Doppler two-dimensional echocardiography, computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging played a crucial role in early detection and monitoring of these complications.While the management of these cases remains controversial and undefined by large experience some guidance is needed as the frequency of CTO-PCI and the retrograde approach increases. Taking our observations together with previous reports we suggest the following when retrograde CTO-PCI results in septal hematoma formation (Figure 5). Inpatient telemetry, hemodynamic, and Creatine Kinase (CK) and CK-MB levels monitoring of these patients for symptoms and signs of hematoma expansion is prudent.Patients who remain asymptomatic can be managed conservatively and dismissed 24–48 hours after CTO-CPI. Among those with symptoms of hematoma expansion, those without hemodynamic compromise can also be monitored with serial echocardiography and dismissed after 3-4 days of additional observation in the absence of additional evidence of hematoma expansion or significant shunt formation. We recommend more aggressive management with hematoma exclusion for those with hemodynamic compromise, evidence of additional hematoma expansion, pericardial effusion, tamponade, or significant shunt development (Qp/Qs > 1.5 : 1). Early dismissal after definitive management is not unreasonable and may be useful in avoiding prolonged inpatient observation, but the long term outcome of this approach is unknown. After successful CTO-PCI, exclusion of septal hematoma can be accomplished by local occlusion of the contributing septal perforator or occlusion of the origin of the septal with a covered stent. Both the donor and recipient vessel side of the collateral must be occluded to prevent flow into the hematoma. After unsuccessful CTO-PCI only the donor limb of the collateral needs to be occluded. Local occlusion of either limb of the septal can be accomplished with aspiration (as in Case 1) through a microcatheter or coiling with a bailout strategy of covered stenting. We preferentially use aspiration and coils in an effort to avoid the long term risk of covered stent restenosis or thrombosis which is as high as 30% in some series [11]. Additionally, coil occlusion of the septal hematoma space is possible. Caution should be used with microsphere, thrombus, gelfoam, or thrombin injection thrombosis of the hematoma space as many of these communicate with a ventricular cavity and extrusion of these materials into the cavity is a potentially catastrophic possibility.Septal hematoma formation is an unusual but potentially dangerous complication of the increasingly used technique of retrograde CTO-PCI. The case reports to date provide some clues as to the best management of this event. We propose an observation and treatment algorithm and recommend serial imaging with contrast echocardiography to assist in the decision-making during these rare but important events.Abdul-rahman R.

Successful Retrieval of a Dismembered Central Venous Catheter Stuck to the Right Pulmonary Artery Using a Stepwise Approach
Department of Cardiology, Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital, Shizuoka,  JapanReceived 1 July 2016; Accepted 18 August 2016Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2016 Keisuke Nakabayashi et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Recent advances in anticancer chemotherapy have resulted in an increase in the number of patients requiring a central venous port catheter, and the incidence of catheter pinch-off syndrome has been increasing. Catheter pinch-off syndrome is a rare and unusual complication. It is difficult to retrieve dislodged catheters from the pulmonary artery, especially if the catheter is stuck to the peripheral pulmonary artery. We herein describe the successful removal of a catheter stuck in the pulmonary artery with a stepwise approach. First, a pigtail catheter was used to tug the dislodged catheter in order to free the unilateral end. Then, a gooseneck snare was used to catch and pull the catheter out of the patient. The key to success is to free the end of the catheter.Cancer treatments include the following three main strategies: surgical therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy has significantly advanced owing to the development of new anticancer drugs, such as molecularly targeted drugs. However, this approach requires intravenous injection for a long duration, which results in severe vascular pain, inflammation, and the possibility of infection if administered from the peripheral vein. Therefore, cancer patients who receive chemotherapy often receive central venous port catheter (CVPC) implants. However, one complication that can occur with the use of a CVPC is catheter pinch-off syndrome (POS).POS is caused by intermittent compression of the catheter between the clavicle and first rib and trapping between the subclavian muscle and costoclavicular ligament. This complication is observed in up to 1.0% of patients who have received a CVPC, and 40% of these patients experience catheter dislodgement [1]. Moreover, POS exclusively results from excessive medial venous access of the subclavian vein. The dislodged catheter moves to the superior vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, and finally pulmonary artery. It is difficult to retrieve dislodged catheters from the pulmonary artery, especially if the catheter is stuck in the peripheral pulmonary artery. In general, prolonged intracardiac manipulation of guidewires and catheters could cause cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac/vascular injury. Therefore, simple and safe maneuvers should be attempted in complicated cases. The key to success is to free the end of the catheter. Here, we report the successful removal of a catheter in the pulmonary artery with a stepwise approach that involved freeing the stuck catheter using a pigtail catheter and catching the catheter using a gooseneck snare.A 40-year-old woman with a mass in her breast and without any specific medical history underwent right muscle-preserving radical mastectomy and level III lymphadenectomy. A pathological study indicated that the mass was an infiltrating duct carcinoma and that there was extranodal invasion. Therefore, she was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy that included adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and herceptin; however, after the first course of chemotherapy via the left brachial vein, she experienced peripheral phlebitis of the left brachium and severe nausea. She underwent CVPC implantation surgery at the right subclavian vein using a percutaneous needle puncture approach based on anatomical landmarks without ultrasound guidance. Chemotherapy administration via CVPC was started two months after the implantation. However, infusion resistance and skin swelling on administration of the anticancer drugs via the CVPC appeared nine months after CVPC implantation.She was asymptomatic; however, chest radiography revealed that the catheter had dislodged, and computed tomography confirmed that the catheter was stuck to the right pulmonary artery and indicated that it was straddling the right main pulmonary artery (Figure 1). She was referred to our cardiovascular department for removal of the dislodged catheter percutaneously. She agreed to our percutaneous strategy and signed an informed consent form.We initially inserted an 8-Fr sheath via the right femoral vein. We then administered 5,000 U of heparin after sheath insertion and maintained the activated clotting time between 200 and 300 s. As we performed the procedure immediately after the diagnosis, pre- and postadministration were not performed. Thereafter, we moved an 8-Fr Judkins Right guiding catheter (Mac1, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) to the right pulmonary artery with a Berman catheter (Harmac Medical Products, Buffalo, NY, USA) and performed pulmonary angiography (Figure 2). One end of the dislodged catheter was stuck to the upper pulmonary artery branch, and the other end was in the lower pulmonary artery branch. Digital subtraction angiography showed no flow in the upper pulmonary artery branch, indicating that the dislodged catheter was completely stuck without any gap. We initially attempted to catch it with a single-loop snare (Amplatz gooseneck snare, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) and triple-loop snare (EN Snare, Merit Medical Systems, South Jordan, UT, USA); however, we could not grasp the catheter because the acute tapering shape of the pulmonary artery caused difficulty in wire control and the complicated branching prevented the wires from entering the same artery. We then attempted removal with the entwined guidewire technique (crossing multiple guidewires in the same vessel and twisting together to entwine with the dislodged catheter), which is similar to the procedure for retrieving foreign bodies in the coronary artery; however, the procedure failed owing to the same reasons mentioned previously. We realized that selection of the correct distal pulmonary artery was very difficult and that we should use a proximal pulmonary artery. We decided to pull the end of the dislodged catheter from the distal pulmonary artery to the right main pulmonary artery and catch it with a gooseneck snare. We used a pigtail catheter to tug the dislodged catheter. We inserted an 8-Fr Judkins Right guiding catheter near the dislodged catheter, delivered the pigtail catheter straightened with a 0.035-inch guidewire to the distal pulmonary artery, rolled the pigtail catheter by drawing out the 0.035-inch guidewire, and pulled back the pigtail catheter and guiding catheter together. After several attempts, this procedure successfully freed the end of the dislodged catheter in the right main pulmonary artery (Figure 3(a)). Thereafter, we easily grasped the body of the dislodged catheter (Figure 3(b)). As we did not fix the grasping point considering unintended release, the dislodged catheter was replicated during pulling back in the vein. We were unable to place the catheter in the femoral sheath; therefore, we removed the catheter and sheath simultaneously. Hemostasis was easily achieved in a few minutes with manual compression, and no complications were noted.After removal of the dislodged catheter, the old central venous port was retrieved and a new port was implanted at the right jugular vein to avoid recurrence of catheter POS. The patient has been free from any adverse event for three months. She provided consent for the publication of this case report.Recent advancements in anticancer treatment have improved the clinical prognosis of cancer patients. As most anticancer chemotherapy protocols require a CVPC, the number of cases of POS has been increasing. This case presents two important clinical requirements. First, all physicians should be familiar with the CVPC and its management. Second, interventionists should be aware of the procedure for retrieval of intravascular foreign bodies percutaneously. The key to success when using a snare is to free the end of the catheter.A CVPC has been routinely used in cancer patients since the 1980s [2]. This approach has reduced the occurrence of phlebitis, time required for puncture, and chance of infection. However, complications, such as POS, have been reported. POS is caused by the compression of the catheter between the clavicle and first rib, which leads to complete dislodgement (grade 3) [3]. This syndrome can be avoided by using the jugular vein or cephalic vein rather than the subclavian vein. In particular, to avoid excessive medial access of the subclavian vein, the cephalic vein cut-down approach might reduce the complication rate, including the rate of POS [4]. In nursing, it is important to avoid forceful injection and to raise the arm or roll the shoulder during injection to identify positional occlusion earlier [5]. The present case showed moderate resistance to the injected drugs few days prior to recognition; therefore, we might be able to avoid this complication prior to complete dislodgment.If we cannot identify POS in advance and the dislodged catheter enters the right cardiac system, percutaneous retrieval should be attempted first owing to its high success rate and minimal morbidity. Pulmonary embolization of the dislodged catheter might increase the risk of possible complications, such as thrombus formation, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and infection [6]. Although gooseneck loop snares, such as the one used in the present case, are popular for endovascular retrieval of dislodged catheters, they cannot be used if the end of the catheter is not accessible. In such situations, basket snares may be more appropriate or the end of the dislodged catheter should be freed. Additionally, pigtail or Simmons catheters may be used to reposition the dislodged catheter in order to facilitate capture. In this procedure, it is important to introduce the dislodged catheter into the inferior vena cava rather than the pulmonary artery or right ventricle by using the rolling pigtail catheter technique in order to avoid cardiac or vascular complications. We attempted this approach; however, it was technically difficult. Other options include bronchoscopic forceps, myocardial biopsy catheters, Fogarty catheters, hook guidewires [7], ablation catheters [8], and inflated coronary balloons [9]. Considering medical economics and safety, pigtail catheters are the most suitable, and they are familiar to all interventionists (Table 1). It is appropriate to divide the procedure into several steps when the situation is complicated. The gooseneck snare generally does not work appropriately in a large vessel. In our case, the gooseneck snare fortunately caught the dislodged catheter in the right main pulmonary artery. If we had not caught the dislodged catheter with the gooseneck snare, we would have used a homemade big-loop snare [10].There are some safety concerns. We could not perform pulmonary angiography after the procedure to confirm patency, because we had to retrieve the dislodged catheter and guiding catheter simultaneously. As this procedure might cause pulmonary artery injury, we strongly recommend pulmonary angiography or contrast computed tomography immediately after the procedure, if possible. In addition, this patient was an outpatient, and this procedure could be performed on an outpatient basis. However, we believe that inpatient management is better from the point of view of safety (i.e., hemostasis, arrhythmia monitoring, subacute pulmonary embolization, and vascular injury).We reported the successful removal of a catheter stuck in the pulmonary artery with a stepwise approach that involved freeing the catheter using a pigtail catheter and catching the catheter using a gooseneck snare. POS is relatively rare; however, it is a dangerous complication and its incidence is increasing with the increase in the use of CVPCs. Cardiovascular interventionists are generally unfamiliar with malignant diseases and CVPCs; however, if POS occurs, the situation should be appropriately handled. The key to success is to free the end of the catheter.In summary, catheter pinch-off syndrome is a rare and unusual complication. It is difficult to retrieve dislodged catheters from the pulmonary artery, especially if the catheter is stuck to the peripheral pulmonary artery. We herein describe the successful removal of a catheter stuck to the pulmonary artery using a stepwise approach. First, a pigtail catheter was used to tug the dislodged catheter in order to free the unilateral end. Then, a gooseneck snare was used to catch and pull the catheter out of the patient. The key to success is to free the end of the catheter.The authors have no competing interests to declare.
Comment on “A Rare Case of Renal Infarct due to Noncompaction Cardiomyopathy: A Case Report and Literature Review”
1Krankenanstalt Rudolfstiftung, 1180 Vienna,  Austria2Genomics Platform, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, 1002 Tunis,  TunisiaReceived 24 April 2016; Accepted 30 June 2016Academic Editor: Hiroaki KitaokaCopyright © 2016 Josef Finsterer  and Sinda Zarrouk-Mahjoub. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.With interest we read the article by Wats et al. about a 53-year-old female with left ventricular hypertrabeculation/noncompaction (LVHT) in whom renal infarction was attributed to LVHT [1]. We have the following comments and concerns.How can the authors be sure that renal infarction originated from LVHT and not from another source [1]? Were atrial fibrillation, heart failure, venous thrombosis, and patent foramen ovale excluded as source of embolism? The patient had an ejection fraction of 25% and dilated cardiomyopathy, conditions which are prone to cardiac embolism. Why did the authors not consider heart failure as the source of embolism? Were aortic plaques, aortic aneurysm, or renal artery stenosis excluded as causes of renal embolism? A further argument against LVHT as the source of embolism is that some studies have shown that the risk of systemic cardioembolism is not increased in patients with LVHT compared to the general population [2].We do not agree with the statement that LVHT is a genetic disease, due to an arrest in the embryonic compaction process. Though LVHT is associated with mutations in >40 genes [3], none of these mutations have ever been proven to be responsible for LVHT. Arguments against a causal relation between any mutation and LVHT are that these mutations do not segregate with LVHT in most of the families, that it is quite unlikely that the extensive genetic heterogeneity manifests with the same morphology, that most of these mutations manifest with a broad phenotypic heterogeneity, and that most LVHT cases are nonfamiliar. Did any of the first-degree family members of the index case present with LVHT on echocardiography? A further argument against a genetic cause of LVHT is the phenomenon of acquired LVHT, which occurs particularly in patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), in pregnant females, and in professionally training athletes [4]. Was a NMD in the presented patient excluded?We also do not agree with the statement that Dusek et al., 1975, were the first to describe LVHT. LVHT has been described already in 1969 by Feldt et al. who reported biventricular, bizarre, spongy myocardium in a 3-month-old Caucasian female with complete situs inversus on autopsy [5].Though the authors mention ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death extensively in the discussion, they do not mention if the patient had undergone long-term ECG recordings [1]. Did the index patient undergo Holter monitoring and what were the results? Was the family history positive for sudden ventricular arrhythmias, syncopes, or cardiac death? Did any of the first-degree relatives require implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator?Overall, this interesting case could profit from a discussion about alternative causes of renal infarction, from a more extensive family screening for LVHT, and from a more comprehensive work-up of the patient with regard to source of embolism. To improve the understanding of LVHT, more widespread investigations need to be carried out in individual patients and their relatives.The authors declare that there are no competing interests.Josef Finsterer and Sinda Zarrouk-Mahjoub contributed equally.
The Role of TEE in Diagnosing Hepatopulmonary Syndrome and Cryptogenic Cirrhosis

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.In the vast majority of cases, ongoing hypoxemia in a cirrhotic patient is usually hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) until proven otherwise; in this case, HPS was suspected prior to any known diagnosis of cirrhosis. This is the first reported case in the literature whereby HPS and cirrhosis were diagnosed after the fact, rather than with the preexisting knowledge of liver cirrhosis. Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is considered in individuals with the triad of liver disease, impaired oxygenation, and intrapulmonary microvascular dilatations. The prevalence of HPS among patients with chronic liver disease in the literature is approximately 24% [1]. Although 80% of patients will present with findings of chronic liver disease, the remaining 20% will have new onset dyspnea as their only presenting complaint [2].Hypoxemia is commonly associated with liver disease, albeit quite nonspecific. A differential diagnosis of hypoxemia in a patient with known chronic liver disease would include hepatic hydrothorax, portopulmonary hypertension, and HPS. In the setting of HPS, severe hypoxemia occurs secondary to shunting through intrapulmonary microvascular dilatations leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatches [3].We describe a case of a 54-year-old female presenting with unexplained hypoxemia and late transfer of agitated saline contrast from the right-sided circulation into the left atrium on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), leading to a new diagnosis of HPS due to cryptogenic liver cirrhosis.A 54-year-old Caucasian female with a 15-pack-year smoking history presented for evaluation of hypoxemia. She described NYHA Functional Class III exertional dyspnea over the preceding 7 months, in the absence of any chest tightness or respiratory symptoms of coughing or wheezing. She denied orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or peripheral edema. She did not notice any new rashes, arthralgias, or myalgias to suggest an underlying connective tissue or lung disease. There was no significant travel or exposure history.On physical examination, her oxygen saturation was 91% on 3 L, and she had blood pressure of 115/76 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 82 beats per minute. On respiratory exam, there were normal breath sounds bilaterally with no wheezes, crackles, or pleural rubs on auscultation. On cardiovascular examination, S1 and S2 were normal, with an early peaking grade II/VI crescendo-decrescendo murmur, loudest at the right upper sternal border radiating to the carotids, consistent with mild to moderate aortic stenosis. There was no evidence of stigmata of chronic liver disease.Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed preserved left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction >60% and mild to moderate subaortic stenosis. There was no evidence of other valvular heart disease and no obvious shunts noted on color Doppler. On TEE, there was evidence of late transfer of agitated saline contrast from the right-sided circulation into the left atrium. During spontaneous respiration, >20 bubbles were identified in the left heart after the 4th beat consistent with a moderate extracardiac shunt (Supplemental Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/9029606). CT of the chest did not demonstrate any evidence of interstitial lung disease or large pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). By diagnosis of exclusion, microvascular intrapulmonary dilatation was suggested as an etiology of the intrapulmonary shunting. An abdominal ultrasound was performed. This raised the possibility of cryptogenic liver cirrhosis, which was confirmed on liver biopsy.The patient was subsequently assessed by the gastroenterology and hepatology services. There was no evidence of esophageal varices on screening endoscopy. The patient underwent assessment for liver transplantation, but due to multiple comorbidities and concerns about compliance, the patient was deemed not to be a suitable candidate. She is being managed conservatively at present.Saline contrast echocardiography is a routine technique in the discrimination between intra- and extracardiac shunting. Although an intracardiac shunt is confirmed by the presence of right-to-left shunting across the interatrial septum within 3 cardiac cycles [4], an extracardiac shunt is suggested with late transfer of contrast [5, 6]. The differential diagnosis for a delayed right-to-left shunt on echocardiography is limited and includes pulmonary AVM in the context of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasias (HHT), HPS, congenital heart defects with cavopulmonary shunting, and possibly normal variant [7]. As approximately 80% of pulmonary AVMs are associated with HHT [6], CT of the chest is the noninvasive imaging test of choice [6]. In the setting of a normal CT, an abdominal ultrasound should be performed as approximately 10–30% of patients with cirrhosis will have HPS [7].As a complication of liver disease, HPS is most commonly observed in patients with portal hypertension [8]. Although the pathophysiology of HPS is incompletely understood, it has been hypothesized that the inability of the liver to clear or inhibit nitric oxide, endothelin-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha may play a role in the formation of pulmonary AVMs [9]. The clinical manifestations of HPS are the consequences of both hepatic and pulmonary dysfunction; however, clinical findings more specific for HPS include platypnea and orthodeoxia [2]. The diagnosis of HPS requires the triad of liver disease, hypoxemia, and evidence of intrapulmonary shunting on contrast echocardiography [9] and carries with it an increased mortality rate as compared to case matched controls [10]. There are currently no effective medical therapies for the treatment of HPS. Although many approaches to improve gas exchange have been attempted, long term oxygenation and liver transplantation have proven to be the only successful modes of managing patients [8]. For those patients who remain hypoxic after transplantation with large AVMs, intra-arterial coil embolization has been utilized to improve the right-to-left shunt [9].The present case report is unique and raises some important learning points for the practicing clinician. To begin with, this case illustrates the diagnostic challenge in working up unexplained hypoxemia. After standard workup to rule out respiratory causes of hypoxemia were completed, the patient was sent for a thorough cardiac evaluation. TEE was effective in ruling out an intracardiac shunt, and, moreover, pursuing saline contrast injection demonstrated a moderately significant late bubble transfer. In the absence of clinical features consistent with HHT, the diagnosis of exclusion was HPS. Since the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was not initially suspected in this patient, the TEE finding led to abdominal ultrasound imaging and liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. In the vast majority of cases, ongoing hypoxemia in a cirrhotic patient is usually HPS until proven otherwise; in this case, HPS was suspected prior to any known diagnosis of cirrhosis. This is the first reported case in the literature whereby HPS and cirrhosis were diagnosed after the fact, rather than with the preexisting knowledge of liver cirrhosis.The differential diagnosis for a delayed right-to-left shunt on echocardiography is limited and includes HPS. Even in the setting of a negative history for chronic liver disease, HPS may still be the cause for hypoxemia.The authors have conformed to institutional ethical guidelines.Consent was obtained from patients included in the case report.The authors report no financial relationships or competing interests regarding the content herein.
Delayed Tamponade after Traumatic Wound with Left Ventricular Compression

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Delayed cardiac tamponade after a penetrating chest injury is a rare complication. The clinical diagnosis of tamponade is facilitated with imaging. We present a case report of a 23-year-old male who was brought to emergency after multiple stab wounds to the chest. After resuscitation and repair of laceration of right internal mammary artery and right ventricle, he was discharged but later returned with shortness of breath. Echocardiography revealed a rare case of delayed pericardial tamponade causing left ventricular collapse. The pericardial effusion was treated with emergent pericardiocentesis and later required a thoracoscopy guided pericardial window for definitive management. A 23-year-old male was brought to the emergency department after being stabbed 5 times in the chest and abdomen. He was resuscitated and an emergency chest tube was inserted for a left sided hemothorax. The Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) was negative but later showed a progressively enlarging pericardial effusion. He was subsequently taken to the operating theater for a thoracic exploration.After sternotomy, it was apparent that the knife transected the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and lacerated the right ventricle (RV) just below the pulmonic valve level. The LIMA was ligated, RV was repaired, and a pericardial window was created. Exploration of the other wounds did not reveal any deeper penetrating injuries. His postoperative recovery was rapid and a subsequent echocardiogram showed no fluid recollection. He was discharged home shortly after.Ten days later, he presented to the emergency department again but now complained of dyspnea, orthopnea, pleuritic chest pain, and lower limb edema. He showed typical clinical features of Beck’s triad (i.e., hypotension, elevated JVP, and muffled heart sounds). He also had a significant pulsus paradoxus of 14 mmHg. The ECG showed electrical alternans (Figure 1), and a chest X-ray showed enlarged cardiac silhouette compared to chest X-ray before discharge (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)). A bedside echocardiogram performed in emergency department showed a new pericardial effusion with signs suggestive of tamponade physiology. Fluid resuscitation started, and he was urgently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) for further care.An urgent bedside echo showed a large circumferential pericardial effusion with collapse of all cardiac chambers including a partial collapse of the left ventricle (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)) (Supplementary Videos A and B in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/2154748).An emergency echo guided pericardiocentesis was performed but only 200 mL of bloody pericardial effusion was extracted; however, there was immediate improvement in his clinical status. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram showed reduction in the effusion size with resolution of tamponade. The patient later underwent a thoracoscopy assisted pericardial window to drain the effusion. He is currently enjoying an active life one year after his discharge.Penetrating cardiac trauma has a high mortality rate. While mortality has decreased with advances in emergency medical services [1], less than 10% will reach the hospital alive. Among the survivors that present to the emergency department, 70% will have evidence of acute tamponade. Of those that did not survive, 20% were found to have tamponade [2]. Thus, even if patients survived their initial trauma, patients are at risk of delayed cardiac tamponade.Delayed cardiac tamponade is a well-described entity after both blunt [3] and penetrating trauma [1]. Pericardial effusion can be seen late in up to 22% of penetrating chest injuries [4] but luckily only a small fraction of these will present in clinical tamponade. Less than 50 cases of delayed pericardial effusion have been reported in literature.A diagnostic and therapeutic challenge: delayed cardiac tamponade can occur up to 100 days after the index injury, and it may have an atypical presentation [5]. The etiology of the late presentation is unclear, although several mechanisms have been proposed including clot sealing a partial tear that either allows a slow leak into the pericardial sac or suddenly dislodges leading to more rapid accumulation [3]; autoimmune pericarditis and subsequent pericardial effusion; and unidentified laceration of a coronary artery with subsequent spasm that later hemorrhages [1].Cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis. Imaging modalities are vital in confirming clinical suspicion. Echocardiography continues to be the preferred imaging modality given its efficacy, availability, and ease of use. The presence of a pericardial effusion, chamber collapse, dilated inferior vena cava, and variation in mitral and tricuspid inflow are the hallmarks of pericardial tamponade on echocardiography. Right atrial (RA) systolic and right ventricle (RV) diastolic collapse has been described as an early sign of rising intrapericardial pressure, with the former being more sensitive and the latter being more specific [6]. Indeed, the longer duration of RA or RV collapse during a given cardiac cycle, the more severe the tamponade and the more specific the finding in echocardiography [7].The collapse of left sided cardiac chambers is a more ominous sign. Left atrial collapse is more specific, but it is observed in only 25% of patients [6]. Left ventricular (LV) collapse in the setting of pericardial tamponade is very rare given its higher intracavitary pressure and the thicker wall. It has been observed in few cases of localized postoperative effusion and in circumferential pericardial effusion [8, 9]. Our case demonstrates an indentation of LV lateral wall in early diastole in parasternal short axis clips.The treatment of delayed pericardial tamponade relies on resuscitation while preparing for urgent surgical evacuation. The optimal surgical strategy is unknown given the paucity of data that is mostly derived from case reports or case series. The standard of care for treatment is a subxiphoid pericardial window. Our patient did well with thoracoscopy guided pericardial window with a good clinical response and no reaccumulation of fluid. Sternotomy is most likely justified in case of hemodynamic instabilities despite technically successful pericardiocentesis.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Ultrasound Assisted Catheter Directed Thrombolysis in the Management of a Right Atrial Thrombus: A New Weapon in the Armamentarium?
1Internal Medicine Department, Detroit Medical Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI,  USA2Division of Cardiology, Detroit Medical Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI,  USAReceived 25 May 2016; Revised 28 July 2016; Accepted 10 August 2016Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2016 Mohamed Shokr et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Catheter related thrombosis (CRT) is a commonly encountered entity fraught with substantial risk for mortality secondary to various complications including pulmonary embolism (PE), tricuspid regurgitation, endocarditis, right sided heart failure, and cardiogenic and septic shock. CRT carries a mortality rate of 18% in hemodialysis patients and more than 40% in nonhemodialysis patients. Management strategies include systemic anticoagulation, systemic thrombolysis, surgical evacuation, and percutaneous retrieval with no established guidelines. Ultrasound assisted catheter directed thrombolysis emerges as promising modality with a relatively lower risk of hemorrhage compared to systemic thrombolysis. We report a case of a 75-year-old man with dialysis catheter related thrombosis without PE for which ultrasound assisted catheter directed thrombolysis was used successfully as an alternative therapy.Catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) is a known complication of central venous catheters (CVC) with a reported incidence of 5–62% in asymptomatic thrombosis and 28% for symptomatic thrombosis. CRT carries a mortality rate of 18% in hemodialysis patients and more than 40% in nonhemodialysis patients [1]. Treatment options include systemic anticoagulation, systemic thrombolysis, surgical evacuation, and percutaneous retrieval with no established guidelines. We present a case of CRT for which ultrasound assisted catheter directed thrombolysis with an EKOS catheter was used as an alternative therapy.A 75-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN), prostate cancer status postprostatectomy, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis was admitted from his dialysis center for an elective thrombectomy of his clotted left upper extremity arteriovenous graft (AVG). This finding had prompted insertion of a right subclavian permacath two weeks prior to admission. The patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 110/70, heart rate of 70 bpm, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. On cardiovascular exam, he had normal S1 and S2 with no appreciated murmurs, rubs, gallops, jugular venous distension, or lower extremity edema. His basic lab panel was unremarkable and no leukocytosis was noted. He was originally scheduled for thrombectomy of the graft by vascular surgery but then was found to have asymptomatic Mobitz-I AV block on EKG which prompted cardiac evaluation. During this evaluation, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was significant for a prominent echodensity in the right atrium (RA). A subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) demonstrated a serpiginous, highly mobile, elongated, oscillating echodensity measuring 8.4 cm × 0.5 cm prolapsing across the tricuspid valve orifice, probably consistent with thrombus [Figures 1, 2, and 3]. The thrombus was seen attached to the anterolateral aspect of the right atrium at what appeared to be the site of microtrauma ensuing from the tip of the deep seated permacath. Intravenous heparin was immediately started and the patient was boarded for direct thrombolysis via EKOS catheter which was inserted through a 7 French sheath into the left subclavian graft. A Wholey wire was advanced into the right ventricle (RV) and the EKOS catheter was placed through the dialysis line into the RA and through to the RV. An alteplase bolus of 5 mg was administered and was continued as a drip at a rate of 2 mg/hr for 10 hours.A follow-up TEE upon discontinuation of local thrombolytics showed resolution of the thrombus [Figure 4]. The patient was then started on warfarin. The hypercoagulability workup came back negative except for an elevated homocysteine level of 27 μm/L (3.2–10). Our patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission without suspicion of PE. Permacath was removed two weeks later.CRT might be an underreported entity due to the asymptomatic nature and is usually detected after complications occur [2]. It is associated with different types of dialysis catheters and the incidence may vary according to venous site location or placement as well [1]. In one study of 55 patients with catheters placed into the RA, TEE revealed that 46% developed a thrombus within one week, in contrast to patients with catheters at the right atrial-superior vena caval junction who had no detected thrombi at week one or six. However, the National Kidney Foundation recommends right atrial positioning for better blood flow rates during dialysis [3].CRT is associated with various complications including pulmonary embolism (PE) (4–6% of cases, with a three-month mortality rate of 16–29%), tricuspid regurgitation, partial obstruction of the tricuspid valve, endocarditis, right heart failure, electromechanical dissociation, cardiac arrest and cardiogenic or septic shock [1].The postulated pathophysiologic mechanism leading to thrombosis includes activation of the coagulation cascade due to the repeated direct mechanical trauma to the right atrial wall caused by the catheter tip (most likely cause in our case as the thrombus was seen attached to the anterolateral aspect of the right atrium at what appeared to be the site of microtrauma ensuing from the tip of the deep seated permacath), exacerbated by altered fluid dynamics around the catheter in addition to intraluminal clot elongation and the increased thrombogenicity in hemodialysis patients [2].In terms of the diagnostic modality, TEE has better sensitivity and specificity when compared to the TTE. In addition, 3D-echocardiography can provide higher resolution of the size, point of attachment, and mobility of the mass when compared to TTE [2].Management strategies for CRT include anticoagulation, thrombolysis, surgical evacuation, and percutaneous retrieval, all combined with removal of the CVC after an initial period of anticoagulation; however there are no established guidelines or well characterized data on the incidence of various complications. Stavroulopoulos et al. concluded that no treatment choice was superior to the other in their meta-analysis of 71 cases of CRT in dialysis patients published as of December 2010 [1].Among FDA approved thrombolytics for PE treatment, rtPA seems more favorable being fibrin-specific with a short half-life allowing surgical interventions in cases of thrombolytic failure [4]. Systemic thrombolysis accelerates thrombus lysis and pulmonary reperfusion and reduces pulmonary hypertension in cases of Type A thrombi with acute massive PE including those without hemodynamic compromise. Type A thrombi are highly mobile, free floating, emboli in transit from deep venous thrombosis, found in structurally normal atria and have a higher incidence of PE [1]. Systemic thrombolysis also lyses thrombi in different locations: lungs, RA, and the initial venous thrombus as well [4].However thrombolysis is not as successful when it comes to type B thrombi which are those attached to the atrial wall and associated with structurally abnormal atrium or catheters. Stavroulopoulos et al. reported success in two patients among the eight who received thrombolytic therapy, one with pulmonary emboli and a large thrombus that extended from the right atrium to the right ventricle and to the left atrium via a patent foramen ovale and another after failed anticoagulation. This report further suggested that systemic thrombolysis use be reserved only for cases of failure of other approaches or those with concomitant massive PE [1].Systemic thrombolysis carries a 22% risk of major hemorrhage including a 3% risk of intracranial hemorrhage as well as a high risk for fragmentation and distal embolization when used for large mobile thrombi leading to recurrent PE [5].Surgical thrombectomy is one of the treatment options, usually under cardiopulmonary bypass. It is recommended in scenarios such as contraindicated anticoagulation, large thrombi > 60 mm where anticoagulation was not previously used, concomitant cardiac abnormalities that could be corrected in the same setting like presence of patent foramen ovale (PFO), and endocarditis with a surgical indication [6].It was used as a first choice, as reported by Stavroulopoulos et al., in 17 patients and in 5 patients after failure of medical treatment. Three cases died postoperatively. Comparing survivors with nonsurvivors in the surgery group, age was the only significant difference,  versus  years, respectively, . To note, six patients were anticoagulated after the surgical extraction of the thrombus [1]. It should be borne in mind that the patient population with CRT has a significant likelihood of being poor surgical candidates given their comorbidities.Anticoagulation has been used as a first line or as an adjunctive treatment following other interventions. It was successful in most cases and was usually used for 6 months. Comparing 37 cases who received anticoagulation to 23 surgical thrombectomies, there was no significant mortality difference, 16.2% and 13%, respectively, . The median value of thrombus size was 28 mm in both groups [1].Percutaneous intravascular removal of CRT represents another treatment modality however due to risk of mechanical dislodgment, perforation, and the technical difficulties especially in dealing with large thrombi; its use is advocated when other treatment modalities are contraindicated [7].The emergence of ultrasound assisted catheter directed thrombolysis (The EKOS EndoWave Infusion Catheter System (EKOS Corporation, Bothell, WA)) as a method of local thrombolytic delivery provides another possible treatment modality for CRT. The ultrasound waves accelerate the fibrinolytic process by enhancing catheter directed thrombolysis. This in turn reduces the treatment time and total thrombolytic dose resulting in less risk of bleeding [8]. To our knowledge, two prior cases were reported so far, both used in cases of right atrial thrombi that were not dialysis catheter associated, and both had concomitant PE. Nickel et al. reported a case of failed EKOS use as 48 hrs later there was a residual occlusive thrombus in the suprarenal IVC extending to the cavoatrial junction that was successfully retrieved using the Vortex Angiovac system [9] while Shammas et al. reported successful EKOS use with complete resolution of the thrombus 24 hours later as evidenced by echocardiogram [10]. We include a comparison between our case and prior reported cases of EKOS catheter use [Table 1].In our case, the use of EKOS resulted resolution of the thrombus. Subsequently, systemic anticoagulation with warfarin was initiated and our patient was discharged home in stable condition. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of EKOS used in the treatment of CRT without concomitant PE.Catheter related thrombosis is a commonly encountered entity fraught with substantial risk for mortality. Determining the best treatment approach that guarantees complete resolution of the thrombus while avoiding fragmentation and ensuing pulmonary embolism poses a challenge for physicians. We believe that the decision should be individualized after carefully deliberating potential risks associated with surgical intervention, hemorrhage with systemic thrombolysis, technical difficulties with percutaneous retrieval, and the size of the thrombus. EKOS emerges as another modality with a relatively lower risk of hemorrhage compared to systemic thrombolysis; however, extreme caution and experience are required to avoid thrombus fragmentation during the catheter insertion.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests.
Endoscopic Ultrasound for the Detection of Left Atrial Appendage Thrombus: A Useful Technique in Patients with Transesophageal Echocardiography Contraindication
1Cardiology Department, University General Hospital of Ciudad Real, Ciudad Real,  Spain2Myocardial Pathophysiology Area, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares [Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research] Carlos III (CNIC), Madrid,  Spain3Interventional Cardiology Department, University General Hospital of Ciudad Real, Ciudad Real,  Spain4Digestive Department, University General Hospital of Ciudad Real, Ciudad Real,  SpainReceived 12 March 2016; Accepted 2 August 2016Academic Editor: Renee BornemeierCopyright © 2016 Manuel Marina-Breysse et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Endoscopic ultrasound is a diagnostic and therapeutic technique used in specialized centers for patients that have undergone digestive procedures. This technique enables highly precise real-time imaging of the digestive tract wall and surrounding organs. Endoscopic ultrasound is also useful in patients with cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation. In patients with contraindication for transesophageal echocardiography due to high risk of esophageal bleeding or complications that may require immediate intervention, endoscopic ultrasound may be a safer option for visualizing atrial chambers to rule out the presence of left atrial appendage thrombi before cardioversion.We present a 75-year-old woman admitted with symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate. CHA2DS2-VASc risk score was 5 considering hypertension, age, gender, and diabetes. HAS-BLED score was 4 due to type C-derived hepatitis with cirrhosis and esophageal varices. As we first decided rhythm control strategy, ruling out the presence of left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombi was mandatory before cardioversion. However, patient’s history of esophageal varices was a relative contraindication for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) [1]. Therefore, we decided to use an endoscopic ultrasound approach as described previously [2, 3], which indeed might have provided an additional support in case of esophageal bleeding. With a Pentax EG-3870UTK endoscope coupled to a Hitachi HI Vision Avius console (ultrasound beam frequency at 7.5 MHz), endoscopic ultrasound echocardiography was performed without complications. Video-endoscopic imaging provided direct visualization of the esophageal varices (Figure 1) and optimal visualization of the LAA which had a thrombus inside (Figure 2). Therefore, anticoagulation and rate control strategy to relieve symptoms were finally decided. One month later, the patient was asymptomatic and free from thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events.Endoscopic ultrasound is a diagnostic and therapeutic technique. Most specialized centers use it for patients that have undergone digestive procedures such as gastrointestinal tumor staging, where endoscopic ultrasound has provided a major breakthrough for characterizing such tumors and distinguished between intramural and extramural lesions. Endoscopic ultrasound imaging is usually performed by positioning the distal ultrasound transducer (frequencies ranging from 5 to 12 MHz) adjacent to the lesion of interest. This technique enables highly precise real-time imaging of the digestive tract wall and surrounding organs. The key point is that these endoscopic probes are also useful in patients with cardiovascular diseases such as AF. In spite of being at that time a monoplanar device, endoscopic ultrasound has a high quality 2D resolution, color Doppler, and pulsed Doppler.Endoscopic ultrasound may be a safer option for visualizing atrial chambers when the patient is at high risk of esophageal bleeding or complications that may require immediate intervention [4] as well as when patients have functional or anatomic variations in the hypopharynx/upper esophagus [2]. Although endoscopic ultrasound is generally safe, complications may occur secondary to sedation, therapeutic interventions, or advancement of endoscopic ultrasound. Rare complications may also occur with endoscopic ultrasound—incidence of esophageal perforation is 0.06%—with the advantage of being immediately identified during the procedure, and some of them—esophageal bleeding included—could be treated at the same time [4]. Clinical trials support its use in gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to esophageal varices [5] and the utility of this technique to assess the presence of LAA thrombi has been described in this report. This report opens a new field for further studies that would evaluate if endoscopic ultrasound can be a safer technique to rule out the presence of left atrial appendage thrombi before cardioversion when transesophageal echocardiography is contraindicated.Key Teaching Points. Endoscopic ultrasound may be a safer technique to rule out the presence of left atrial appendage thrombi before cardioversion when the patient is at high risk of esophageal bleeding or transesophageal echocardiography is contraindicated.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
A Patient with a Right Atrium Mass and Congenital Heart Disease: A Challenging Diagnosis of a Stubborn Disease
1Heart Failure Center, Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan 610072,  China2Geriatric ICU, Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan 610072,  ChinaReceived 18 February 2016; Revised 12 July 2016; Accepted 1 August 2016Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2016 Wenyan Wang et al.

An intracardiac mass has rarely been reported to be the cardiac involvement of extranodal lymphoma. It is difficult to establish a final diagnosis via routine examinations. The ability of an echocardiogram to characterize tissue is limited; systemic (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans provide important information for both staging and response assessment in patients with lymphoma. A 68-year-old Chinese male with a second patent foramen ovale (PFO) and an interventricular septal defect presented at our institute with persistent fever, shortness of breath, repeated paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) attack, and rapidly progressing superior vena cava syndrome. The patient also presented with a mass located in the upper right atrium and superior vena cava which was detected by echocardiogram. (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan revealed a pathological increase of (18)F-FDG uptake in the atrial mass and several other extracardiac lymph nodes. Lymph node biopsy was positive for large B-cell lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed intense and diffuse expression of CD20, CD10, BCL-6, and Ki-67. The patient died without any chemotherapy 18 days after hospital discharge.Cardiac masses arising from the heart or the pericardium are rare [1] and potentially lethal. Cardiac Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is extremely rare and accounts for 1-2% of primary cardiac tumors involving the right versus left atrium at a ratio of approximately 8 : 1 [2, 3]. Older patients with untreated congenital heart disease and the comorbidity of cardiac lymphoma are even less common and have a poor prognosis. We report the case of an old man who had initially presented with PFO/VSD heart failure and endocarditis and then was later diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in his right atrium after a mass was discovered via PET/CT.A 68-year-old Chinese male presented to the geriatric ICU in May, 2015, with a “persistent fever lasting two months and worsening shortness of breath lasting one month.” Two months prior to presenting to the ICU, the patient began to experience shivering and hyperpyrexia reaching 40°C and a cough with phlegm production. He denied chest pain and hemoptysis. One month prior to presenting to the ICU, he began to complain of palpitations and edema in his lower extremities. He received antibiotics and diuretics without any progress. Although he was previously diagnosed with chronic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema many years earlier, PFO and VSD remained untreated. He has been a smoker for 40 years and there is nothing significant in his family history.Vital signs at time of admission were as follows: temperature 38.8°C, pulse 150 bpm, being conscious and anicteric, no cyanosis, and an operative lymph node palpable in the left iliac region without tenderness. Coarse crackles were heard at the base of lungs bilaterally, as well as cardiac murmurs at the third and fourth intercostal space on the left bounder of the sternum. Moderate pitting edema of both lower extremities was also observed. Laboratory tests were WBC 7.37 × 10E9/l, N 75.8%, Hb 105 g/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 89.15 mg/L, BNP 523 pg/mL, PCT 0.25, and ESR 95 mm/h. Renal function and liver enzymes were within normal limits. Blood plasmodium test and ANA spectrum were negative. Blood culture was Staphylococcus hominis (sensitive to vancomycin). ECG was paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) with HR at 155 beats/min. Chest X-ray showed there was some patchy consolidation at the right upper lung and bilateral pleural effusion. The lymph nodes with reactive hyperplasia were detected by ultrasound at bilateral inguinal regions.Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is shown in Figures 1-2.After his admission, the patient was put on intravenous cefoperazone-tazobactam 2.5 g q12h for 16 days and intravenous Vancomycin 500 thousand q8h for 5 days and then increased to q6h for 11 days. The patient was also put on Propafenone, metoprolol, Perindopril, diuretics, and glyceryl trinitrate. He continued to experience worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea and swelling in his right upper limb, and ECG telemonitoring showed repeated attack of PSVT. The patient was suspected to have developed superior vena cava syndrome; furthermore, the patient received a vascular ultrasound with no thrombosis detected, and BNP reduced to 159 ng/mL. Systemic (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)) revealed that the (18)F-FDG uptake in the mass located in the right atria pathologically increased. The patient finally received lymph node biopsy: large B-cell lymphoma, CD20(+) CD3 T cell(+) Bcl-6(+), CK(+) CD21(−) CD10(−) MUM-1(−) EBER(−). The patient and his family declined chemotherapy and he was discharged from the hospital. He died after 18 days of following up.The incidence of NHL has increased in recent decades in Asia [4]. But lymphomas rarely involve the heart with incidence between 9% and 24% on autopsy series. NHL can affect the heart but usually in the form of pericardial effusion which is often associated with direct epicardial spread [5]. Only 0.5% of all extranodal lymphomas present as cardiac neoplasms [6].Cardiac masses arising in the heart or the pericardium are potentially lethal; they have variable symptoms which lack specificity; the clinical presentation is determined utilizing numerous factors. Depending on tumor location, size, growth rate, degree of invasion, and friability, the clinical presentations could include fever, fatigue, arthralgia, refractory congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion, sudden death [7], and superior vena cava syndrome. The rarity and heterogeneous clinical presentation of PCL make its diagnosis difficult. Imaging studies such as TEE may not be reliable in distinguishing cardiac lymphoma from other cardiac neoplasms including myxomas, angiosarcoma, or rhabdomyomas. Endomyocardial biopsy, excisional intraoperative biopsy, and pericardial fluid cytological evaluation should be utilized to establish final diagnosis.We are reporting this case of NHL and massive intracardiac involvement diagnosed by echocardiographic and PET/CT assessment. The patient’s heart defect, medical history of lung disease, persistent fever, and positive blood culture are what guided the original misdiagnosis of hematosepsis and endocarditis. It is hard to explain how come even BNP decreased but refractory arrhythmia and superior vena cava syndrome were getting worsen based on aggressive treatment of antibiotics, diuretics, and vassal dilator. Although TTE is the preferred initial imaging technique used in the detection and diagnosis of cardiac masses, its ability to characterize tissue is limited. (18)F-FDG PET/CT scanning is superior in this regard and, due to its noninvasive approach, should therefore be the diagnostic tool of choice for cardiac mass assessment for the elderly, particularly those who might lose the chance to receive invasive procedures such as TEE or myocardial biopsy. The sensitivity of FDG PET/CT imaging was reported to be 71–100%, with a specificity of 69–100% and a negative predictive value of 80–100% [8, 9].The prognosis for patients with cardiac sarcomas remains very poor [10]. DLBCL is an aggressive lymphoma that is typically treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy which could improve the survival rates [11]. Early systemic chemotherapy, in addition to restricting the tumor, might yield a better prognosis.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Platypnea-Orthodeoxia Syndrome after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation
Institut Cardiovasculaire Paris-Sud, Hôpital Privé Jacques Cartier, 91300 Massy,  FranceReceived 24 April 2016; Accepted 28 July 2016Academic Editor: Yoshiro NaitoCopyright © 2016 Andrew K. Roy et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Progressive dyspnea and hypoxaemia in the subacute phase after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are uncommon and warrant immediate assessment of valve and prosthesis leaflet function to exclude thrombosis, as well as investigation for other causes related to the procedure, such as left ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, and respiratory sepsis. In this case, we report the observation of a patient presenting two weeks after TAVI with arterial hypoxaemia in an upright position, relieved by lying flat, and coupled with an intracardiac shunt detected on echocardiography in the absence of pulmonary hypertension, raising the suspicion of Platypnea-Orthodeoxia Syndrome (POS). Invasive intracardiac haemodynamic assessment showed a significant right-to-left shunt (Qp/Qs = 0.74), which confirmed the diagnosis, with subsequent closure of the intracardiac defect resulting in immediate relief of symptoms and hypoxaemia. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an interatrial defect and shunt causing Platypnea-Orthodeoxia Syndrome after transcatheter aortic valve implantation, resolved by percutaneous device closure.Dyspnea is the commonest presenting symptom for severe calcific aortic stenosis, occurring in approximately 60–70% of patients who are considered at high or prohibitive risk for surgery but eligible for TAVI [1]. For these patients, TAVI significantly improves mortality when compared with medical therapy for aortic stenosis and leads to sustained improvement of cardiac symptoms and in the majority of patients [1].To determine suitability for TAVI under conscious sedation, patients will typically undergo a number of investigations including transthoracic echocardiography, coronary angiography, thoracic multidetector computed tomography, and assessment of the peripheral vasculature for iliofemoral patency. During this evaluation, any other reversible cardiac causes of dyspnea, such as severe coexisting proximal coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure, will be detected and treated with the aim of minimizing periprocedural events and ensuring an optimal and durable response to TAVI. Thus, the development of acute or subacute dyspnea in the initial period after TAVI is a serious concern, prompting the clinician to immediately consider mechanical aortic prosthesis dysfunction, as a result of thrombosis or infection, along with other more common causes of dyspnea such as congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and respiratory sepsis. In this case report of new onset dyspnea one week after TAVI, the observation of postural hypoxaemia, normal aortic prosthesis function, and clear evidence of a new intracardiac shunt on echocardiography prompted us to consider the rare clinical Platypnea-Orthodeoxia Syndrome as a cause for this patient’s symptoms.A 65-year-old male with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, pacemaker, mild left ventricular dysfunction, and metastatic carcinoid syndrome underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) under conscious sedation with an Edwards S3™ 29 mm device. His postoperative course was unremarkable and he was discharged well 7 days later. One week after discharge, he represented to our center with progressive dyspnea and resting hypoxaemia, with standing oxygen saturation of 82%, not responding adequately to supplemental oxygen, but returning to 97% by lying flat. Pulmonary scintigraphy was negative for pulmonary embolism and there was no evidence of respiratory or systemic sepsis. N-Terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide was elevated at 803 pg/mL (pre-TAVI = 3400 pg/mL, discharge post-TAVI = 400 pg/mL). Immediate transthoracic echocardiography was performed, which did not reveal TAVI prosthesis dysfunction or aortic regurgitation but did show moderate right atrial dilatation. The mean transaortic gradient was 6 mmHg, unchanged from that measured immediately after TAVI. Transoesophageal contrast echocardiography revealed a bulging interatrial septum, along with a significant right-to-left interatrial shunt (Figure 1) that was not present when compared to previous magnetic resonance imaging (Figure 1). Right ventricular function was normal, with normalization of his left ventricular function. Cardiac catheterization revealed the following haemodynamic measurements: right atrial pressure, 11 mmHg; mean pulmonary artery pressure, 18 mmHg; pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure, 9 mmHg; and cardiac output, 4.6 L/min. Oxygen saturations were measured as follows: inferior vena cava, 65.0%; superior vena cava, 74.1%; low right atrium, = 72.3%; high right atrium, 68.7%; pulmonary artery, 70.4%; left atrium, 87.6%; left superior pulmonary vein, 97.0%; and aorta, 91.5%, giving a Qp/Qs shunt ratio of 0.74, consistent with a right-to-left shunt. Based upon the demonstration of an anatomical interatrial defect, functional shunting in the setting of recent TAVI, and clinical symptoms with impaired oxygenation, the diagnosis of Platypnea-Orthodeoxia Syndrome was made and we elected to close the PFO. The patient’s symptoms resolved with septal occlusion using a 35 mm Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) occlusion device (Figures 1(c)–1(f)), and no hypoxia was observed at discharge the following day. At one-year follow-up the patient was well with no recurrence of symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first case of symptomatic atrial shunting across PFO described after TAVI.Platypnea-Orthodeoxia Syndrome (POS) is an uncommon clinical cause of dyspnea and hypoxaemia associated with interatrial communications and functional alterations required to preferentially shunt venous return towards the septal defect [2]. It is associated with a number of cardiac, pulmonary, or abdominal conditions and, given the potentially reversible nature, should always be considered when hypoxaemia with postural features remains unresponsive to standard oxygen therapy [3]. For patients with aortic disease, the aorta may compress the right atrium, and POS has been described in the setting of dilated or horizontal aortas due to aortic valve disease, aneurysms, kyphoscoliosis, previous surgical repair, and congenital heart defects [3]. POS has also been described in a patient who had undergone recent surgical aortic valve replacement, attributed to the presence of significant aortic dilatation [2–4].The diagnosis is confirmed with cardiac imaging to visualize the septal defect, ideally by transoesophageal echocardiography with bubble/contrast study, although cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or right heart catheterization and shunt calculation are also suitable, particularly where the diagnosis is unclear. The definitive treatment is septal occlusion using a percutaneous occlusion device or surgical approach. For the patient in this case report, it is postulated that a state of chronic shunt equalization (as indicated by septal bulging with no shunt on previous cardiac MRI) was stable until TAVI was performed, with left ventricular compliance and diastolic pressures rapidly improving, causing a situation where venous return from the IVC, with distortion of the right atrium, was now preferentially shunted across the PFO when the patient was upright.As TAVI is rapidly becoming accepted as a standard treatment for aortic stenosis, often for patients who are older, with more aortic dilatation, and other comorbid conditions that may predispose to Platypnea-Orthodeoxia Syndrome, clinicians should consider this potentially reversible condition when unexplained hypoxaemia and dyspnea present in the setting of aortic valve disease.Dr. Lefèvre is a proctor for Edwards Lifesciences.

Adult ADHD Medications and Their Cardiovascular Implications

Sinha et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurobiological disorder exhibited by difficulty maintaining attention, as well as hyperactivity and impulsive behavior. Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants are the first line of treatment for ADHD. With the increase in number of adults on CNS stimulants, the question that arises is how well do we understand the long-term cardiovascular effects of these drugs. There has been increasing concern that adults with ADHD are at greater risk for developing adverse cardiovascular events such as sudden death, myocardial infarction, and stroke as compared to pediatric population. Cardiovascular response attributed to ADHD medication has mainly been observed in heart rate and blood pressure elevations, while less is known about the etiology of rare cardiovascular events like acute myocardial infarction (AMI), arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy and its long-term sequelae. We present a unique case of AMI in an adult taking Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts) and briefly discuss the literature relevant to the cardiovascular safety of CNS stimulants for adult ADHD.Adult ADHD affects an estimated 3% to 5% of adults worldwide. It is seen in 4.4% (62% male, 38% female) of the US adult population [1]. CNS stimulants, namely, amphetamine based stimulants, methylphenidate, dextromethamphetamine, dextromethylphenidate, and modafinil, are the first line of treatment for ADHD. CNS stimulants act by inhibiting reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine as well as increasing their release into the extracellular space. Approximately, 2% of American adults in 20–44 age groups were using stimulant medications for ADHD in 2010 which was a significant increase in use among both males and females (+188% and +265%, resp.) when compared to the prior decade [2]. In the study by Gerhard et al., 10.5% of adult ADHD patients had evidence of ≥1 preexisting cardiovascular condition. Even in patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions, close to 80% of all ADHD medications initiated were stimulants. The knowledge of preexisting cardiovascular conditions did not significantly reduce the likelihood of stimulant treatment [3].Adults with ADHD are possibly at higher risk for developing unhealthy lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking and obesity, and have a greater probability of chronic substance misuse. Studies suggest that adult ADHD patients are more likely to experiment with licit and illicit substances, especially at earlier ages, and exhibit risky substance use patterns and subsequently develop substance use disorders [4, 5]. ADHD patients also have cooccurring psychiatric disorders, like anxiety (47%), mood disorder (38%), poor impulse control (20%), and substance use disorders (15%) [1]. These individuals can be on a number of medications along with stimulant drugs; effect of combination drug therapy on cardiovascular system has not been well studied.It is possible that, in adults on CNS stimulant therapy, chances of having other cardiovascular risk factors may increase with each passing decade of life. Scrutiny has recently increased, primarily due to marked increase in the use of CNS stimulants among adults [6]. AMI as well as atrial fibrillation has been previously reported in cases of recreational amphetamine abuse [7] and also in adolescent ADHD patients on stimulant therapy [8]. Here, we discuss a rare case of AMI and atrial fibrillation in an adult who was on mixed amphetamine salts and briefly review pertinent literature.A 31-year-old Caucasian man presented to the emergency room with palpitations associated with shortness of breath and lightheadedness. He was diagnosed with ADHD at 15 years of age and was prescribed mixed amphetamine salts. His starting dose of mixed amphetamine salts was 7.5 mg and he took it for 5 years after the diagnosis. He restarted taking it 6 months prior to presentation as his symptoms were interfering with his daily activities. He had been prescribed 20 mg of mixed amphetamine salts twice daily but three months back had cut back on his dose to 20 mg once a day, on account of intermittent self-limiting episodes of palpitations lasting 5–10 minutes. He did not seek medical attention for these symptoms. On the day of presentation, he had taken mixed amphetamine salts 20 mg in the morning and later took 10 mg in the afternoon. However, that evening he also consumed four 16-ounce beers but denied any smoking or use of illicit drugs. After about 1-2 hours, he developed significant palpitations that were different in nature and lasted longer along with shortness of breath and lightheadedness without any chest pain, nausea, or diaphoresis.His past medical history was unremarkable except for ADHD. He did not have other symptoms or signs suggestive of pheochromocytoma or hyperthyroidism. There was no family history of cardiovascular diseases. He admitted occasional use of alcohol and marijuana (once a month) but denied the use of energy drinks or other illicit drugs. He had no known drug allergies and took no other medications other than mixed amphetamine salts. On physical examination, his heart rate was 92 beats per minute, respirations were 20, and blood pressure was 90/53 mm of Hg. His cardiac exam was significant for irregularly irregular heart sounds of varying intensity. His lung fields were clear and he was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed atrial fibrillation with an average ventricular response of 98 bpm and ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V1, and V2 with reciprocal changes in leads III and aVF (Figure 1(a)). The EKG after 13 minutes showed resolution of the ST segment elevations (Figure 1(b)).His initial set of cardiac enzymes was CPK: 138 U/L, CK-MB: 5.9 ng/mL, troponin I: 0.13 ng/mL, and myoglobin: 4.7 ng/mL. He received aspirin 325 mg. He was later admitted to the cardiac unit for hemodynamic monitoring and serial cardiac enzymes, EKGs, and assessment of left ventricular (LV) function. Subsequent troponin levels rapidly increased to 6.91 ng/mL. The rest of his cardiac enzymes were CPK: 387 U/L, CK-MB: 77.9 ng/mL, and myoglobin: 34 ng/mL. Chest X-ray was normal. All of his routine laboratories including lipid profile were unremarkable. His TSH was 1.83 U/mL and free T4 was 0.91 ng/dL. The urine drug screen was positive for amphetamines only. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal LV dimensions and good LV systolic function, without evidence of wall motion abnormalities. He also underwent coronary angiography that did not reveal any epicardial coronary artery disease. He was treated with oral diltiazem 30 mg three times daily and the patient’s symptoms and atrial fibrillation resolved (Figure 1(c)). Serum troponin levels started trending down by second day. The final diagnosis of AMI and atrial fibrillation secondary to mixed amphetamine salts use was made. Patient had uneventful hospital course and was discharged on third day.Adderall, formulation of D-amphetamine and L-amphetamine salts in the ratio of 3 : 1, is a prescription CNS stimulant drug for ADHD and is used in all age groups. The exact mechanism of cardiovascular impact of stimulants is unknown. The proposed mechanisms by which stimulants may give rise to adverse cardiovascular events are (a) by elevating blood pressure (BP) and increasing the heart rate (HR) [9], (b) increased levels of circulating catecholamines inducing vasospasm [10], (c) higher levels of circulating proinflammatory immunoactive glycation end products causing vasculitis [11], (d) inducing QT interval prolongation which is associated with torsades de pointes [12], and (e) coronary artery intimal hyperplasia [13].Amphetamines have acute chronotropic and pressor effects. The cardiovascular epidemiological literature has shown that even modest increases in BP and HR have been associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events [14–17]. In the meta-analysis carried out by Mick et al. on 2665 adult patients, it was observed that CNS stimulants used for adult ADHD were associated with a statistically significant increase in resting heart rate of 5.7 bpm and increase in systolic blood pressure of 1.2 mmHg but not of diastolic blood pressure. A low overall risk (≤5%) of clinically significant cardiovascular events, including tachycardia or hypertension, was also observed [18]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that elevated resting heart rate is a significant independent predictor of mortality and a shorter life expectancy [16, 17]. Cooney et al. demonstrated that 15 bpm increase in heart rate was found to increase the rate of cardiovascular disease mortality by 23–50% in men and women [16]. Perret-Guillaume et al. showed that heart rate increase of 10 bpm is associated with a 20% increased risk of cardiac death [17]. HR increases comparable with those observed with CNS stimulant treatment for adult ADHD have been associated with a 17% increased cardiovascular mortality [19] and about 8% in those with coronary artery disease [20]. In another study carried out by Wilens et al., statistically significant change in systolic blood pressure by about 5 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of about 7 mm Hg was observed. Blood pressure variations of this magnitude, in particular during long-term therapy, have been acknowledged to increase morbidity and mortality [21].Abnormal sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac inputs secondary to stimulant use can result in increased myocardial excitability and conductance. Patients with exaggerated sympathetic nervous system activity are more susceptible to develop clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias typically more in the setting of an underlying structural heart defect [22]. There are very few reports associating amphetamine-dextroamphetamine therapy to new onset atrial fibrillation [23] and atrial flutter [24]. A recent case series analysis study conducted in 1224 patients aged <17 years showed increased risk of arrhythmia in all exposed time periods (incidence rate ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.48 to 1.74), and the risk was highest in the children with congenital heart disease. The risk of myocardial infarction was higher between 8 and 56 days after the start of treatment with methylphenidate. Overall, for all exposed time periods there was no significant risk of myocardial infarction (1.33, 0.90 to 1.98). There was no significant increased risk for hypertension, ischemic stroke, or heart failure [25].Other CNS stimulants such as modafinil and methylphenidate have also been rarely reported to cause frequent premature ventricular contractions [26]. Zhang et al. showed that long QT syndrome patients especially males, when treated with ADHD medications, had higher risk of unfavorable cardiac events during follow-up. The stimulant drugs did not significantly change average QTc interval. Small proportion of individuals in the study cohort however did have increment in QTc by 30–60 milliseconds to above 470–500 milliseconds [27].The three most important observational studies conducted on adults that address whether prescription stimulant and nonstimulant drugs are associated with adverse cardiovascular events are by Holick et al., Schelleman et al., and Habel et al. [28–30]. Holick et al. conducted their study on matched cohort of 21,606 stimulant ADHD medication initiators, 21,606 atomoxetine initiators, and 42,993 age and sex matched general population cohort (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) between 2003 and 2006. They observed an increased risk of transient ischemic attack only and not of stroke, among adult ADHD medication starters when compared to the general population, in their secondary analysis. However, unlike the primary analysis the general population cohort was not matched with the combined atomoxetine and prescription stimulant user cohort using propensity matching [28].Schelleman et al. matched 43,999 new methylphenidate users to 175,955 nonusers in adults (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) and reported that methylphenidate is associated with a 1.8- fold increased risk of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, but no similar trend was noted for stroke, myocardial infarction, or combined stroke/myocardial infarction. The drawback with this study was that primary analyses were adjusted for age and data source only. There was smaller but significantly increased risks of sudden death, ventricular arrhythmia, and all-cause death, similar to primary analyses, with subsequent analyses using propensity scores to address confounding factors [29].Most extensive and largest of the three adult studies carried out by Habel et al. did not report any increased risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and stroke among 150,359 adults ADHD prescription stimulant users during short median exposure (0.33 years) when compared to 292,839 nonusers in adults aged 25 years to 64 years. Surprisingly, statistical results suggested that ADHD medications have protective effect with regard to serious cardiovascular outcome which according to the authors themselves is biologically implausible and most likely could be attributed to be biased by a “healthy user effect” [30]. Patient pool in the above three observational studies was less selective as compared to randomized clinical trial but certainly healthier than the general adult ADHD population. The biggest limitation of Habel et al.’s study is consideration of only severe cardiovascular events that dampened the absolute conclusion in spite of big sample size.These results were similar to two other studies that were conducted in children and young adults. McCarthy et al. showed no increase in risk of sudden death associated with stimulants and atomoxetine in patients aged 2–21 years [31]. Cooper et al. conducted a retrospective cohort study in children and young adults aged 2–24 years and showed that current users of ADHD drugs were not at increased risk for serious cardiovascular events, although the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval indicated that a doubling of the risk could not be ruled out. However, the absolute magnitude of such an increased risk would be low [32].Safety concerns with regard to prescriptions stimulants use have guided governmental regulatory policy from time to time. Current clinical recommendations emphasize the need to assess the patient’s personal and family cardiac history prior to initiation of ADHD pharmacotherapy, being vigilant about abnormal cardiovascular history (e.g., premature sudden/unexpected death in children or young adults, clinically important arrhythmias, prolonged QT syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and Marfan syndrome) [33]. HR and BP should be measured before initiating medications and routinely during treatment. Universal EKG screening has not been shown to be cost effective, as it has not demonstrated any incremental benefit in preventing sudden cardiac death in children with ADHD [34]. EKG screening and cardiologist consultation are recommended for ADHD patients who have positive history of structural cardiac abnormalities [35] and even though baseline EKG before initiating ADHD medications is considered reasonable by ACC/AHA [36], it is not endorsed by American Academy of pediatrics [33].Ours is the first case report of AMI and atrial fibrillation in an adult who was on short acting mixed amphetamine salts without intention to overdose or abuse, to the best of our knowledge. Patient reduced his earlier dose of 20 mg of mixed amphetamine salts twice daily to 20 mg once daily. He did however consume higher than his daily total dose  of mixed amphetamine salts on the day of presentation. The temporal association of AMI and atrial fibrillation with higher than usual dose of mixed amphetamine salts makes amphetamines the most plausible etiology. It is difficult to ascertain whether atrial fibrillation occurred independently or it was exacerbated by higher than usual dose of stimulant. The simultaneous use of alcohol with stimulants may have had additive effects. Cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver areinvolved in metabolism of both alcohol and amphetamine. Alcohol competes with amphetamine for the metabolism in the liver and hence may enhance the bioavailability of amphetamine [37, 38]In an adult stimulant user, in absence of cardiovascular risk factors, coronary vasospasm either epicardial or microvascular may be a predominant reason for AMI. Such patients usually present with atypical chest pain. The diagnosis of AMI involves elevation of myocardial necrosis biomarkers, ischemic symptoms, and EKG changes. Management of such patients is guided by clinical presentation and initial imaging studies employed to assess left ventricular function and coronary patency. Those with persistent chest pain, hemodynamic instability, and rising troponin levels should be managed on a case-by-case basis.Adult ADHD is significantly impairing and the use of CNS stimulants among adults is on the rise. It is likely that in coming years increasing number of unhealthy adult ADHD population is going to be exposed to CNS stimulant treatment. Definite conclusions regarding the overall cardiovascular safety of these agents cannot currently be made for patients at varying risk for cardiovascular disease or in relation to chronic treatment exposure. At present, there is less data available to guide and inform clinical practice in many patients with adult ADHD and concomitant cardiovascular disease and/or risk factors.The ongoing debate about the cardiovascular safety of these medications is here to stay and underscores the challenge in conclusively establishing safety and the need to evaluate risk in the context of the evolving clinical practice. Prospective scientific investigations should include systemic cardiovascular monitoring in clinical trials, more extensive and prolonged cardiovascular studies, and large-scale epidemiologic studies to help gain insight with regard to both the short- and longer-term cardiovascular impact of CNS stimulants in adults with ADHD.Patient’s consent was obtained for the publication of this work.B.

Ventricular Septal Defect from Takotsubo Syndrome
1Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104,  USA2Division of Cardiology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104,  USAReceived 27 April 2016; Revised 25 June 2016; Accepted 10 July 2016Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2016 Daniel Y.

Although the prognosis with medical management is excellent in most cases, rare cases of serious complications can occur. We present here a case of a 71-year-old woman presenting with acute decompensated heart failure with initial findings consistent with a myocardial infarction, who was found instead to have an acute ventricular septal defect as a complication of Takotsubo Syndrome.Takotsubo Syndrome [1], also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, apical ballooning syndrome, or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is an increasingly recognized syndrome characterized by transient systolic dysfunction and EKG/cardiac enzyme changes that can mimic myocardial infarction. Echocardiography often reveals a characteristic pattern including apical akinesia/dyskinesia and ballooning along with basal hyperkinesia [2–5]. Although this condition is usually associated with an excellent prognosis and recovery with medical management in most patients [5, 6], serious complications can occur, including most frequently pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock and less frequently cardiac rupture. We present here a case of a patient with an acute ventricular septal defect as a complication of Takotsubo Syndrome.The patient was a 71-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension, and cirrhosis, transferred to our hospital for management of acute decompensated heart failure. She was previously a highly active and independent individual until a recent tibial/fibular fracture from a mechanical fall. Her home medications were Insulin, Tramadol, and Bactrim. She presented from her rehab facility to an outside hospital with hyperglycemia (glucose greater than 700) and, on initial evaluation, was noted to have ST elevations in V3–V6, Troponin 4.46, and creatine kinase 130. She was diagnosed with a subacute myocardial infarction (MI). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 20–25%, with apical akinesia and ballooning and hyperdynamic base (Figure 1(a), Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/2693062) consistent with Takotsubo Syndrome, as well as a distal muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) (Figure 1(b), Video 2). She received intravenous (IV) diuresis, was initiated on IV heparin and a heart failure regimen, and was transferred to our hospital for further management.On arrival, she was afebrile with blood pressure of 107/51 mmHg, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 18 on 3 L of oxygen. On examination she had a 3/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at the apex and was volume overloaded with jugular venous distension to 15 cm H2O and 2+ lower extremity edema. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, poor R-wave progression, T-wave inversions in II, III, aVF, V2–V6, and prolonged QTc of 570 ms, patterns consistent with those described with Takotsubo Syndrome [2–4, 7, 8]. Repeat TTE on arrival, 11 days after the initial TTE, showed EF recovery to 75% (Figure 1(c), Video 3), a persistent 1 cm inferior apical VSD, and right ventricular (RV) dilatation and elevated pulmonary pressures, with pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of 57 mmHg. The VSD was thought to be a major contributor to her continued decompensation. She was managed with diuresis and medical optimization and underwent evaluation for VSD repair.Although she had no prior echocardiogram for comparison, discussion with the patient’s primary care provider revealed that she had no cardiac history and no documented cardiac murmur throughout her prior history. To rule out VSD as a complication of MI, the patient underwent left heart catheterization, demonstrating completely normal coronary arteries. Ventriculography confirmed VSD. Right heart catheterization demonstrated right atrial pressure of 7 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure of 42/14 mmHg, wedge pressure of 10 mmHg, cardiac output of 4.0 L/min, and index of 2.7 L/min/m2, with Qp : Qs ratio of 2.2 : 1, consistent with a large VSD. Given these findings, initial echocardiographic appearance of her heart, and rapid EF recovery, she was thought to have a rare case of ventricular septal perforation due to Takotsubo Syndrome. She underwent transcatheter closure of her VSD (Figure 1(d), Video 4), was medically optimized afterwards, and was eventually discharged home after a prolonged hospitalization. Repeat echocardiography performed 2 months later demonstrated normal PASP and improvement in right heart function.Takotsubo Syndrome is a condition of transient left ventricular failure that can mimic acute MI. It predominantly affects older women and is often associated with physical or emotional stressors [3, 5–8]. Although the exact pathogenesis is unknown, the role of catecholamine surges coupled with reduced parasympathetic modification resulting in myocardial stunning, multivessel epicardial spasm, and microvascular spasm has been implicated [2, 3, 8–10]. While Takotsubo Syndrome has an excellent prognosis with mostly complete recovery of cardiac function, it can occasionally lead to severe complications such as cardiac rupture, including left ventricular free wall rupture [3, 11]. While the mechanism is unclear, reports of cardiac rupture from Takotsubo Syndrome have included discovery of inflammatory infiltrates as well as myocyte and contraction-band necrosis at the rupture site, which may potentially be in part secondary to the aforementioned high catecholamine state [5, 11–13].As demonstrated in this case, echocardiography can be critical in the diagnosis and followup of Takotsubo Syndrome, often being the first imaging modality to identify the pattern of wall motion classically associated with the syndrome as well as other atypical variants, and is important for followup to recovery. Echocardiography is also additionally useful both for evaluating for possible complications that could significantly alter management (i.e., thrombus, cardiac rupture, mitral regurgitation, and outflow tract obstruction) and to identify imaging characteristics (i.e., EF, E/e’ ratio, and mitral regurgitation) that may prognosticate poor outcomes [10, 14]. Other more advanced echocardiography techniques that can be used include speckle-tracking, contrast echo, and stress echo, which can provide further understanding regarding overall pathophysiology and mechanisms of dysfunction in this syndrome [10].Our patient, previously healthy, presented with acute decompensated heart failure, demonstrating the classic features of Takotsubo Syndrome: demographic of a postmenopausal woman with recent stressor of hospitalization, surgery, and rehabilitation for fractures, TTE findings of akinesis and ballooning of the left ventricular apex with basal hyperkinesis, and EKG and Troponin abnormalities mimicking an ST-elevation MI in the absence of angiographic coronary artery disease. Although she was initially diagnosed with a subacute MI at the outside hospital, her case was not consistent with infarction for several reasons: most importantly, her coronaries were completely normal without any stenosis or luminal irregularities, there were no Q-waves present on EKG on followup, and postrecovery echocardiograms demonstrated normal wall thickness without evidence of residual wall motion abnormalities. Although she had no prior TTEs for comparison, her VSD was not consistent with a congenital or chronic VSD for several reasons: she was 71 years old, had no prior cardiac history, and was functionally normal prior to presentation, an unlikely scenario for a VSD of this size. Furthermore, she presented with a presumably new loud systolic murmur, given her previously documented normal cardiac exams. Finally, a large chronic VSD in a 71-year-old adult would have likely led to some degree of chronic pulmonary vascular remodeling. Although this patient presented with elevated pulmonary pressures, this resolved to normal soon after VSD closure. Given these reasons in addition to her angiographically normal coronaries, the etiology of her acute VSD is likely secondary to ventricular septal perforation due to Takotsubo Syndrome.Acute ventricular septal defect is a known serious complication of acute MI and can result in significant mortality rates of over 90% if managed medically [15, 16]. The mechanism of rupture in acute MI is thought to be related to transmural necrosis and possibly myocardial hemorrhage. Furthermore, VSD in acute MI is fundamentally different from a congenital VSD given its acuity and its mechanism involving tissue necrosis that causes and surrounds the defect, which may make intervention technically challenging [15]. Given the acuity and severity of disease and high risk of morbidity, surgical repair or, in recent years, percutaneous repair is crucial [16, 17]. Although VSD development after Takotsubo Syndrome is incredibly rare and not as well understood, its acuity as well as its pathology of necrosis and inflammation in select reports [5, 11] likely portends a similarly poor prognosis without intervention.Overall, our case highlights the importance of recognizing, associating, and treating VSD as a complication of Takotsubo Syndrome, despite the common understanding that it carries a benign prognosis, and demonstrates that complications such as this can be significant clinically even with resolution of the Takotsubo Syndrome itself.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Cardiac Fibroelastoma versus Thrombus: Echocardiographic Evidence Can Be Misleading

O’Laughlin et al.

After confirming embolic stroke, she underwent excision of the lesion, which on pathology revealed a nonbacterial thrombus. Ultimately, this led to a more extensive work-up leading to the discovery of a papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, the underlying cause of her hypercoagulable state. The initial echocardiographic findings painted the clear picture of a papillary tumor on the aortic valve which was likely the source of the emboli resulting in ischemic stroke. This unique case presentation illustrates that imaging, including echocardiography, may not always coincide with the clinical diagnosis. Thus, understanding the differential diagnoses of cardiac masses is of vital clinical significance. The distinction of fibroelastoma versus the much less common finding of aortic thrombus may lead to early diagnosis of malignancy and prevention of life threatening events due to stroke or undiagnosed disease. The incidence of primary cardiac tumors is rare with the top three most common tumors consisting of myxomas, lipomas, and fibroelastomas (in order of respective occurrence) [1–3]. Fibroelastomas are described as having a papillary structure and may be found throughout the endocardial tissues, with an affinity for valvular structures [4]. Clinical presentation of this tumor can vary with most patients presenting asymptomatic with incidental finding on echocardiography. Location of the tumor can impact clinical presentation. Tumors on the right side of the heart are commonly asymptomatic or patients may present with pulmonary emboli [5], whereas left sided tumors can result in life threatening embolic phenomena [5]. This is a result of the fragile nature of the tumor’s composition and their high affinity for platelet aggregation [5].Echocardiography remains the cornerstone for identification of cardiac tumors, but the diagnosis based on imaging is not always definitive. Cardiac masses have variations in shape and size making it difficult to diagnose a tumor versus a thrombus based on imaging findings and clinical presentation. The sensitivity and specificity have been estimated to be near 90% when using transthoracic echocardiography in diagnosis of papillary fibroelastoma if tumor size is greater than 2 mm [5]. However, there is still room for an alternative diagnosis. We present a unique case of a presumed aortic valve fibroelastoma that after valve sparing excision turned out to be a nonbacterial thrombus.A 26-year-old previously healthy female presented to emergency department with complaints of headaches for two weeks associated with right sided numbness, weakness, diplopia, facial droop, dysarthria, and ataxia. The patient underwent work-up for a cerebral vascular accident. MRI confirmed the diagnosis of acute stroke involving the left posterior cerebral artery territory with smaller foci of ischemia in various cerebral territories, consistent with embolic phenomena. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a large, papillary, solid, fixed mass, measuring 7 × 7 mm on the left coronary cusp (Figure 1) of the aortic valve that was suspected to be an aortic fibroelastoma due to its papillary structure and size. She underwent valve sparing excision of the fibroelastoma (Figure 2). Pathology later returned consistent with thrombus. The patient was recommended to have a hypercoagulable work-up as an outpatient but was lost to follow-up.Four months after the initial surgery she presented with complaints of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, described as sharp and stabbing in nature. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed massive ascites. Recommended correlation study with transvaginal ultrasound was conducted and revealed a complex mass of mixed echogenicity with mildly increased vascularity measuring 7.6 × 7.2 × 9.0 cm, located posterior to the uterus and extending to the right adnexa. Biopsy of the lesion revealed adenocarcinoma. She went on to undergo bilateral salpingooophorectomy, omentectomy, lysis of adhesions, and peritoneal biopsies confirming a final diagnosis of papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, Stage IIc.Stroke-like symptoms in otherwise healthy young adults can be very alarming. Initial assessment involves multiple brain imaging modalities before a suspected diagnosis is made, as strokes can be ischemic or hemorrhagic in nature. Cardiac emboli are a common source of ischemic stroke and may be the result of bacterial or nonbacterial thrombi, or cardiac tumors. Due to the vast differential of cardiac masses, assessment and diagnosis pose a challenging task for physicians, especially cardiac tumors. Nonneoplastic processes such as thrombus and valvular vegetations can mimic tumors; therefore physicians should consider them as part of the differential diagnosis.Cardiac tumors can be categorized into primary cardiac neoplasms or metastatic deposits from other remote primary neoplasms; most commonly breast, lung, lymphomas, melanomas, and renal tumors [6]. Primary cardiac neoplasms can be either benign or malignant. The most common malignant tumors include angiosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Benign lesions include myxomas, lipomas, and fibroelastomas and represent the most frequent type of intracardiac lesions [1–3]. Myxomas are the most common benign primary cardiac tumor seen in patients 30–60 years of age with increased incidence in women [7]. Myxomas are solitary tumors which arise from the interatrial septum normally within the left atrium [8, 9]. Lipomas are the second most common tumor, occurring in middle to late adulthood, composed of adipocytes, and occur in all chambers within the heart [10, 11]. Fibroelastomas are the third most common tumor, also presenting in middle to late adulthood [11]. They are commonly described as having a papillary structure and can arise from any endocardial surface, but most are found on the aortic or mitral valves [4, 11].The occurrence of primary cardiac neoplasms is rare and diagnosed in about 0.001–0.03% of echocardiographic studies, reported by Sutsch et al., 1991, based an analysis of 20,305 echocardiographs [12]. Transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography is the primary imaging modality in initial work-up of cardiac tumors. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a convenient imaging modality as it is cost effective, noninvasive, and provides efficient results. Within minutes clinicians have vital information regarding the shape, size, mobility, and precise location of masses within the heart [13]. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), though similar to TTE, provides clinicians with superior imaging when compared to TTE due to better acoustic windows resulting from lack of signal loss from penetration through adjacent thoracic wall and lung structures [14]. As a result, better visualization helps to identify morphology of smaller cardiac tumors, less than 5 mm, that may otherwise be missed on TTE [14]. TEE is more invasive and requires mild anesthesia. TEE is usually only warranted if there is a high clinical suspicion for a cardiac mass not seen on TTE or lack of identifiable characteristics of a mass on TTE due to poor acoustic windows [6]. Enhancement of masses during echocardiography with the use of a contrast medium may help to further elucidate whether a cardiac mass is a tumor or thrombus [6, 15]. However, this is only beneficial if the tumor is of malignant origin as these tumors are highly vascularized and will enhance on imaging [6, 15, 16]. The use of contrast echocardiography in distinguishing between benign cardiac tumors and thrombi provides no clinical benefit and is unreliable due to their lack of vascularity and enhancement [6, 16].Treatment of cardiac masses normally depends on the clinical presentation and type of tumor. There is no defined protocol nor evidence based approach to treating these patients; thus clinical judgement in coordination with imagery must be utilized. Benign tumors, including papillary fibroelastomas, are commonly surgically excised due to the high risk of embolic phenomena [17]. On the other hand, malignant tumors typically have poor outcomes despite surgical intervention due to metastatic disease and high rates of recurrence [6, 18].Our patient presented with stroke due to thromboembolic disease from aortic valve vegetation that was believed to be a papillary fibroelastoma due to its papillary structure on echocardiography and patient’s lack of clinical evidence of bacterial endocarditis. TTE and TEE studies revealed findings consistent with a large papillary lesion. Due to the acute risk of further embolic phenomena valve sparing excision was performed revealing a nonbacterial thrombus. Even with the use of contrast echocardiography or cardiac MRI, we would not have been able to differentiate between thrombus and papillary fibroelastoma [19]. Therefore, the benefits of pursuing excision outweighed the risk of surgery as the patient was at high risk for potentially fatal stroke events.Echocardiographic imaging can only provide limited information on the characteristic morphology of cardiac masses, with further contribution to pathologic etiology improved with use of contrast echocardiography or cardiac MRI (limited availability at most institutions). Despite clinical objective evidence supporting benign cardiac tumor etiology (i.e., TEE study consistent with papillary fibroelastoma), one must take the entire clinical picture into account before pursuing invasive surgical procedures. This unique case provides an example that medicine and surgery is not always “textbook” in nature. Even though the echocardiographic evidence supported our clinical suspicion, pathologic analysis did not coincide. Further investigative research must be done to help clinicians and surgeons diagnostically differentiate benign cardiac tumors (myxomas, papillary fibroelastomas, and lipomas) from the less commonly occurring native aortic thrombus. We also recommend that when aortic thrombi are suspected or discovered on imaging, an age-appropriate malignancy work-up should be performed as approximately 15% of cancer patients may have thromboembolic events throughout their disease process [20].The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
The Presence of a Large Chiari Network in a Patient with Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke
1Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06108 Halle (Saale),  Germany2Institute for Pathology, University Hospital Halle, 06108 Halle (Saale),  Germany3Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Halle, 06120 Halle (Saale),  GermanyReceived 16 May 2016; Accepted 10 July 2016Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2016 Nneka Schwimmer-Okike et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The Chiari network is an embryological remnant found in the right atrium, mostly without any significant pathophysiological consequences. However, several cardiac associations are reported in the literature including supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. We present a case of a 96-year-old body donor with a stroke episode and intermittent atrial fibrillations. The dissection of the heart revealed the presence of an immense Chiari network with a large central thrombus. The role of a Chiari network in the pathogenesis of stroke and pulmonary embolism is discussed.While the fetal heart is developing the venous confluence in the right atrium has two valves, called Eustachii and Thebesii. Both valves are secured in the right atrium by the septum spurium. Later in the development these valves and the septum spurium usually regress. However, in some cases the regression remains incomplete resulting in a cor triatriatum. In cases of a partial regression, a fenestrated membrane remains, the so-called Chiari network [1]. While Carl von Rokitansky is believed to be the first describing this anatomical remnant in a single case, it was named after Hans Chiari who described it in a review of 11 cases [2]. In the beginning the Chiari network was believed to be clinically silent, but several publications showed a possible link to cardiac diseases like embolism [3], infective endocarditis [4], or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias [5]. In the vast majority of published cases the Chiari network was diagnosed and illustrated by echocardiography. Here, we report a case of a Chiari network with prior atrial fibrillation and stroke. The immense Chiari network is shown in the dissected heart of the patient.A 96-year-old man was hospitalized because of a neurological failure. The patient showed a flaccid paralysis of the right arm and leg, an incomplete facial paresis on the right, dysphagia, global aphasia, and unilateral neglect, suggesting a stroke. The cranial CT showed no signs of bleeding and no middle line shift. Electrocardiography revealed a tachyarrhythmia caused by an atrial fibrillation with a rate of 100–140 beats/min. Patients’ medical record showed intermitted atrial fibrillations and a thrombectomy due to a TIA (transient ischemic attack) six years ahead of the current event. A treated prostate cancer and nontreated squamous cell cancer were further diagnoses of the patient. One month later and still under observation and treatment the patient died in the hospital.According to his living will the deceased became a body donor for the dissection course at our Institute for Anatomy. During the examination and dissection of the heart the students discovered a net-like structure with a large central thrombus inside the right atrium in close proximity to the inferior vena cava. Figure 1 shows the orifice of the inferior vena cava with view to the thrombus. After the removal of the thrombus a careful examination of the net structure was performed showing its fixation in the inner surface of the right atrium. The histological examination of the resected net structure showed mainly fibrous connective tissue and no cardiomyocytes. The microscopic and macroscopic aspects are consistent with the Chiari network. Figures 2 and 3 show an overview and the opened right atrium and the immense size of the net (4.0 × 2.5 cm). Because of the stiffness of the tissue caused by the fixation procedure of the body donor we neither could confirm nor ruled out further heart malformations like a patent foramen ovale.The Chiari network is an anomaly of the heart with a prevalence ranging from 1.3 to 4.0% [6]. However, more recent studies show prevalence rates up to 10.5% [7]. This anatomic variation and embryologic remnant is believed to be mostly clinical inapparent. Nevertheless, several cases have been described showing relevant pathophysiological consequences. Chang described a case of tricuspid valve regurgitation caused by a Chiari network [8] and Goedde and coworkers showed a case of supraventricular fibrillations demanding the surgical removal of the Chiari network [9]. Atrial fibrillation and tricuspid valve regurgitation are relevant diseases and therefore the presence of a Chiari network has to be taken seriously.The case described by Goedde and coworkers has various similarities with the case presented here: both patients had a Chiari network with a thrombus enmeshed in between. The medical records of both patients showed atrial fibrillations and atrial embolism. While the patient in the case report from Goedde and coworkers suffered from a pulmonary embolism, the patient in the present case had a stroke.The presence of a patent foramen ovale is a prerequisite to cause a paradoxical embolism, leading to a stroke or pulmonary embolism. Schneider and coworkers demonstrated significantly higher prevalence rates for a patent foramen ovale in patients with a Chiari network and herewith a serious risk for the development of an atrial embolism [10]. However, other studies showed a rather minor role of the presence of a patent foramen ovale in the pathogenesis of paradoxical embolism [11]. Various cases of patients suffering a paradoxical embolism without patent foramen ovale have been published [12, 13].To date, only few photographs of a Chiari network have been published. Here we show an immense Chiari network as the possible cause for the longtime intermittent atrial fibrillation, a TIA, and a stroke, finally leading to the death of the patient. In conclusion, the possibility of the presence of a Chiari network with or without a patent foramen ovale should be taken into consideration as a possible (additional) diagnosis for a patient suffering from embolism, infective endocarditis, or supraventricular arrthythmias.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Noncompaction and Dilated Cardiomyopathy in a Patient with Schizophrenia
1Krankenanstalt Rudolfstiftung, 1030 Vienna,  Austria22nd Medical Department with Cardiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Krankenanstalt Rudolfstiftung, 1030 Vienna,  AustriaReceived 6 April 2016; Accepted 22 May 2016Academic Editor: Henri JustinoCopyright © 2016 Josef Finsterer  and Claudia Stöllberger. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Objectives. Psychosis and left ventricular hypertrabeculation (or noncompaction) (LVHT) have not been described in the same patient. Here we report a patient with a long-term history of schizophrenia who was later diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (dCMP) and LVHT. Case Report. A 47-year-old Caucasian male developed nondifferentiated schizophrenia at the age of 26 y. Since the age of 33 y he was regularly drinking alcohol. At the age of 47 y he developed heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an enlarged left ventricle, reduced systolic function, and surprisingly LVHT in the apical segment. Additionally, the left atrium was enlarged, the right ventricular cavities were mildly enlarged, and there were pulmonary hypertension and a small pericardial effusion. Cardiac MRI confirmed the echocardiographic findings. Since coronary angiography was normal, dilated cardiomyopathy was additionally diagnosed. Since he was taking clozapine during years, dilated cardiomyopathy could be due to not only alcohol consumption but also the long-term neuroleptic medication. Conclusions. LVHT may be associated with nondifferentiated psychosis. Management of LVHT is challenging in patients with psychosis due to poor compliance and adherence of these patients. Patients with LVHT and psychosis need particular attention since they usually take cardiotoxic drugs for a long time, which may further deteriorate the prognosis of LVHT.Left ventricular hypertrabeculation (LVHT), also known as left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), is frequently associated with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) and chromosomal defects [1]. Some of the NMDs also present with involvement of organs other than the muscle, including the brain or the heart [2]. Cerebral involvement in NMDs can be variegated but may also include psychosis [3, 4]. Psychosis and LVHT, however, have not been described in the same patient. Here we report a patient with a long-term history of schizophrenia who was later diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (dCMP) and LVHT.The patient is a 47-year-old, HIV-negative, Caucasian male, height 180 cm, weight 81 kg, with a history of nondifferentiated schizophrenia since the age of 26 y. Shortly after onset of psychosis he developed fever and severe headache which resolved spontaneously without therapy or residual deficits. Although he did not undergo CSF investigations, meningitis was retrospectively suspected. Exacerbations of psychosis required recurrent admissions to psychiatric departments at ages 26 y, 28 y, 29 y, 31 y, and 34 y and were successfully treated with neuroleptics. During the first psychotic episode he developed severe pneumonia. Temporarily he was also taking cannabinoids. Additionally, he suffered from chronic alcohol disease since the age of 33 y. His father had a history of questionable Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with complete remission and prostate cancer but no cardiac compromise and no psychiatric disorder.At the age of 47 y he was hospitalised because of extensive leg edema, weight gain, and resting dyspnoea. X-ray of the lungs showed an enlarged heart and pulmonary congestion grade I. Blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an enlarged left ventricle with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15–20% and surprisingly LVHT in the apical segment (Figure 1). Additionally, the left atrium was enlarged, the right ventricular cavities were mildly enlarged, and there were secondary pulmonary hypertension (55 mmHg) and a small pericardial effusion. Cardiac MRI revealed an enlarged left ventricle, with increased myocardial mass and markedly reduced systolic function and severe diffuse hypokinesia (Figure 2). There was no late enhancement but bilateral enlargement of both atria and a small pericardial effusion. LVHT was confirmed by cardiac MRI (Figure 2). Since coronary angiography was normal, dCMP was diagnosed. ECG showed signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. Blood tests revealed hyperbilirubinemia, hypocalcemia, and occasional hyperCKemia with values up to 236 U/L (n <190 U/L). NT-proBNP values were elevated to 2871 ng/L (n <84 ng/L). Intravenous diuretic therapy led to a weight loss of 19 kg. A therapy with candesartan and nebivolol was started. Because of severely reduced systolic function and the increased risk of sudden death, a wearable cardioverter (LifeVest®) was recommended but refused by the patient. Since clozapine has an arrhythmogenic effect [5, 6] and a potential to induce cardiomyopathy [7] or myocarditis [8], psychiatrists recommended switching to aripiprazole which the patient refused. Two months after discharge, the patient was in NYHA stage I of heart failure and echocardiography showed only a slight improvement in systolic function with an EF of 30%. He was taking candesartan (20 mg/d), nebivolol (2.5 mg/d), and spironolactone (25 mg/d). Because of low systolic blood pressure, the neurohumoral therapy could not be uptitrated into the target dose so far. He continued refusing a LifeVest or an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator. His last psychiatric medication included clozapine 6.25 mg/d. Clinical neurologic examination was normal and the patient refused work-up for hyperCKemia.The presented patient is interesting for two aspects. First, the patient had dCMP, LVHT, pulmonary hypertension, and additionally psychosis. Whether there was a causal relation between these four conditions is unknown. No reports about such an association are available from the literature. Whether dCMP is attributable to the chronic alcohol abuse remains speculative. An argument for a causal relation is that dCMP was detected after onset of chronic alcoholism. Strong arguments against a causal relation, however, are that the patient did not present with chemical stigmata of chronic alcoholism, such as hepatopathy or megaloblastic anemia, and that dCMP started 14 y after onset of alcohol abuse. dCMP has been also reported due to clozapine therapy. However, dCMP occurred long after clozapine was started and at a maintenance dosage of 6.25 mg, which makes a causal relation unlikely. Since presumed meningitis was time-related to psychosis it cannot be excluded that psychosis was symptomatic and not endogenous. Arguments in favour of a causal relation between the psychiatric abnormality and LVHT is that LVHT is frequently associated with depression [9] and that the neuromuscular disorder most frequently associated with LVHT may also manifest with psychosis. The combination of psychosis, LVHT, pulmonary hypertension, recurrent CK elevation, dilated CMP, and presumed aseptic meningitis thus suggests a common metabolic defect in this patient.Second, the patient’s father was diagnosed with GBS upon quadriparesis, double vision, and ptosis shortly after a bronchitic infection. However, nerve conduction studies revealed only an axonal lesion with normal velocities in two nerves. CSF investigations were also normal. Despite these atypical findings, he underwent several cycles of plasmapheresis with immunoglobulins with a beneficial effect. At onset of therapy he became delirious. Despite two relapses during hospitalisation, he was released after three weeks without deficits. Since the father did not consent to a follow-up investigation, 25 y after the neuromuscular episode, it remains unclear whether there was a causal link between the previous neuromuscular compromise of the father and the psychiatric and cardiac compromise and hyperCKemia of the son. It also remains unclear whether the father had LVHT or not.In conclusion, this case shows that LVHT and psychosis may occur together in a single patient, which has not been reported thus far. However, a causal relation between LVHT and psychosis remains speculative. Management of LVHT and hyperCKemia is difficult in patients with psychosis due to poor compliance and adherence of these patients. Patients with LVHT and psychosis need particular attention also because they usually take cardiotoxic drugs for a long time, which may further deteriorate the prognosis of LVHT.The authors have no competing interests to declare.
Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy and Catatonia in the Setting of Benzodiazepine Withdrawal
1Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118,  USA2Department of Internal Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA 02118,  USAReceived 26 April 2016; Accepted 17 July 2016Academic Editor: Filippo M. SarulloCopyright © 2016 Teng J. Peng et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We report two serious and unusual complications of benzodiazepine withdrawal in a single patient: takotsubo cardiomyopathy and catatonia. This 61-year-old female patient was brought to the emergency department with lethargy and within hours had declined into a state of catatonia. Although there was never a complaint of chest pain, ECG showed deep anterior T-wave inversions and cardiac enzymes were elevated. An echocardiogram was consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She later received 1 mg of midazolam and within minutes had resolution of catatonic symptoms. Careful history revealed that she had omitted her daily dose of lorazepam for 3 days prior to admission. To our knowledge, the case presented herein is the first report of simultaneous catatonia and takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of benzodiazepine withdrawal. The pathogenesis of both conditions is poorly understood but may be indirectly related to the sudden decrease in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling during benzodiazepine withdrawal.We report here a patient presenting with two rare diagnoses: benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia and takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Catatonia is a behavioral syndrome of immobility, rigidity, and mutism and at times restlessness and dysautonomia [1]. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction after psychological or physical stress; the condition typically mimics myocardial infarction with apical akinesis, modest elevation in cardiac enzymes, and evolutionary EKG changes (ST elevation or depression or T-wave inversions) [2].A 61-year-old white female was brought to our hospital by family for 8 hours of lethargy and confusion. Medical history was significant for COPD on home oxygen, stage 1A adenocarcinoma of the lung (status post-RLL lobectomy), prior opiate abuse (in stable remission on oral buprenorphine-naloxone), prior alcohol abuse (in stable remission per family), and anxiety treated with lorazepam (2 mg daily). One week prior to presentation, she developed increased dyspnea, cough, subjective fevers, and fatigue. The patient’s family administered her usual medications during her acute illness but had omitted her lorazepam for the past 3 days. She became increasingly somnolent and was found on the morning of presentation with a “blank stare” and slurred speech.On arrival at the hospital, vitals were as follows: temperature 36.8°C, HR 104 beats/min, BP 177/110 mmHg, RR 16, and SpO2 96% on 2 L nasal cannula oxygen. She was moderately somnolent but interacted normally and was oriented to person, place, and time. Within hours, she became persistently disoriented with impaired short-term memory and difficulty following commands. All psychoactive medications were held. After 12 hours, symptoms had progressed to near-complete unresponsiveness, immobility, and periodic agitation. Extensive workup showed no abnormalities to explain symptoms. Blood counts, chemistries, liver enzymes, arterial blood gas, TSH, B12, chest X-ray, and brain MRI were unremarkable. Blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures, and Lyme serology were negative. Urine toxic screen was negative for drugs of abuse, including benzodiazepines. Neurology examined the patient and found no focal neurologic deficits. Based on their exam, they also endorsed low clinical suspicion for nonconvulsive status epilepticus.Despite absence of chest pain or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) equivalents, admission ECG showed deep anterior T-wave inversions. Troponin I was 0.16 ng/L (normal < 0.013) and rose to 1.37 ng/L over 18 hours. However, ACS treatment was not pursued as the patient was known to have a coronary calcium score of zero and her exercise ECG stress test ten months priorly had shown no inducible ischemia. Urgent TTE was obtained, which revealed hypokinesis and dilation of the left ventricle consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 35%, down from 60% ten months priorly.Twenty-four hours after initial presentation, the patient became too restless to allow completion of a routine ECG, so 1 mg of midazolam was given. Within minutes of receiving this medication, she began to talk again and became aware of her surroundings. She was able to recognize her daughter, follow commands, and walk. Scheduled lorazepam was initiated. Within 48 hours, the patient was back to her baseline mental status except for feeling fatigued. She denied chest pain and had no symptoms of congestive heart failure. The patient was discharged on hospital day 3 with a lorazepam taper and metoprolol succinate; TTE 10 weeks later showed reversal of apical remodeling and improvement in LVEF back to 60% (Figure 1).Catatonia and takotsubo cardiomyopathy are distinct disorders with mechanisms that are not well understood. They have rarely been reported to occur simultaneously [3], and both syndromes have been separately reported in the setting of benzodiazepine withdrawal [4–10]; however, we are not aware of any prior reports of benzodiazepine withdrawal possibly triggering both simultaneously.Benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced takotsubo has been described twice in published case reports. One [4] described a 49-year-old woman who had her home lorazepam dose (2 mg daily) temporarily withdrawn during a hospital admission. After 28 hours, she began to have symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal along with ST-segment elevations on EKG, with a TTE showing apical akinesis and LVEF of 45%. The second [5] described a 65-year-old woman who self-discontinued several long-term psychiatric medications, including a benzodiazepine, and then presented with syncope and a TTE suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.Benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced catatonia has been reported several times [6–10]. In these reports, each patient stopped long-standing benzodiazepine therapy, then subsequently became confused and mute with symptoms including muscle rigidity or psychomotor agitation, and then experienced rapid reversal of symptoms after resuming benzodiazepines. None of these reports describe concurrent cardiomyopathy, but several predate the first description of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Benzodiazepine withdrawal occasionally also precipitates absence status epilepticus, a prolonged seizure that appears similar to catatonia, with symptoms of confusion, disorientation, and a trance-like state [11]. Our patient’s symptoms resolved before an EEG could be obtained, so it remains unproven whether her event was ictal or neuropsychiatric in etiology, although our consulting neurologist favored the latter.While the pathogeneses of catatonia and takotsubo cardiomyopathy are not well understood, their neurohormonal milieu shares common features with benzodiazepine withdrawal. Benzodiazepines potentiate γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, and thus their withdrawal suddenly decreases the basal inhibitory tone of GABA signaling. Catatonic patients are known to exhibit decreased cortical GABA signaling [12], although this is just one of several postulated mechanisms for catatonia [1]. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been reported during withdrawal from multiple other GABA agonists including alcohol [13] and baclofen [14]; therefore, takotsubo may relate at least indirectly to decreased GABA signaling. The direct cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is thought to be increased catecholamine release from sympathetic nerves, which induces neurogenic myocardial stunning [15]. In animal models, benzodiazepine withdrawal has been shown to increase catecholamine release in the brain and increases symptoms typical of peripheral sympathetic activity [16].The case presented herein is the first documented report of simultaneous catatonia and takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of benzodiazepine withdrawal. We propose that the pathophysiology of both conditions may be at least indirectly related to the sudden decrease in central GABAergic tone seen in the setting of benzodiazepine withdrawal, underscoring the “brain-heart” connection in the field of neurocardiology.The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Refractory Hypotension as an Initial Presentation of Bilateral Subclavian Artery Stenosis
Division of Cardiology, St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine, Brighton, MA 02135,  USAReceived 12 June 2016; Accepted 10 July 2016Academic Editor: Jeffrey A. BreallCopyright © 2016 Maxwell Eyram Afari et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Bilateral subclavian stenosis is a rare clinical condition. An interbrachial pressure difference of 15 mm Hg can raise suspicion for unilateral subclavian artery stenosis, but the diagnosis of bilateral subclavian artery stenosis can be challenging. We present a case of a 75-year-old woman who presented with refractory hypotension after surgery. Initial vitals revealed blood pressure in the 60s/50s mm Hg in both arms. Cardiopulmonary examination was remarkable for diminished pulses in all 4 extremities and audible carotid bruits. She continued to be hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. Troponin T peaked at 0.24 ng/mL (reference < 0.04), and an echocardiogram revealed a reduction in ejection fraction (37% from 50%). Left and right heart catheterization demonstrated normal filling pressures and cardiac output. During the procedure, however, it was noted that the patient’s central blood pressure was 70–80 mm Hg higher than cuff pressures obtained in either arm. Selective angiography revealed 90% left subclavian ostial stenosis as well as 70% stenosis of the right subclavian artery.Bilateral subclavian stenosis is a rare clinical condition [1]. In most clinical settings, unilateral brachial blood pressure is commonly relied upon to make clinical decisions. Rarely do clinicians check both brachial blood pressure values or check even one lower extremity blood pressure. We report a case of an elderly woman who presented with refractory hypotension and was found to have bilateral subclavian artery stenosis.A 75-year-old woman with multiple medical problems was found to be hypotensive after transurethral bladder tumor resection. Her past medical history was remarkable for coronary artery disease with a drug-eluting stent to the left anterior descending artery 5 years ago, chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Past surgical history included left carotid endarterectomy and bilateral femoral bypass 10 and 8 years ago, respectively. After the patient’s bladder tumor resection, she was noted to be persistently hypotensive but asymptomatic. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing woman in no acute distress, afebrile, with blood pressure of 66/50 mm Hg (right arm), oxygen saturation of 90% on 3 liters of oxygen per nasal cannula, respiration rate of 20 per minute, and heart rate of 96 beats per minute. Cardiopulmonary examination was only remarkable for a bruit in the bilateral carotid region. Jugular venous distension and peripheral edema were absent. Mild tenderness of the abdomen was noted.The patient was aggressively resuscitated with three liters of normal saline with no improvement in her blood pressure. Blood pressure checked in the contralateral arm was similar. Electrocardiogram showed poor R-wave progression, evidence of old inferior infarct (Q waves), left ventricular hypertrophy, and nonspecific lateral ST abnormalities (Figure 1). The peaked cardiac enzymes were troponin T 0.24 ng/mL (reference <0.04), creatine kinase-myocardial band 10.1 ng/mL (reference < 6.0), and creatine phosphokinase 121 U/L (reference 38–234). An echocardiogram estimated an ejection fraction of 37% (down from 50% a year prior to admission), diastolic dysfunction, no valvulopathy, and apical and septal hypokinesis. Computed tomography angiogram ruled out pulmonary embolism and demonstrated calcification of the coronary arteries and the aorta.Based on the results above, the patient was sent for cardiac catheterization to rule out new coronary obstruction. The previous LAD stent was found to be patent and the previously noted occluded RCA with collaterals was also unchanged. During the procedure, her central blood pressure was noted to be 204/67 which was 70–80 mm Hg higher than cuff pressure values obtained in either arm. Selective angiography of the left subclavian artery revealed 90% ostial stenosis (Figure 2) while selective angiography of the right brachiocephalic artery revealed 70% stenosis of the right subclavian artery (Figure 3).Subclavian artery (SCA) stenosis is defined by angiographic finding of >50% stenosis in the subclavian arteries. The incidence of SCA stenosis is estimated at approximately four percent [2]. A relationship between SCA stenosis, age, smoking, HDL cholesterol, and the presence of peripheral artery disease has been established [1]. Independent of cardiovascular risk factors and baseline cardiovascular disease, the presence of subclavian stenosis predicts mortality [3].The most common presentation of subclavian stenosis is “subclavian steal syndrome.” This refers to the reversal of flow in a branch of the subclavian artery due to proximal stenosis of SCA. This reversal of flow can occur in an internal mammary artery graft and thus trigger symptoms of cardiac ischemia [4]. Alternatively, patients may present with dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, or syncope due to the reversal of blood flow in the vertebral artery in order to “steal blood from the brain” [5]. Invariably, patients will present with signs of ischemia in the upper extremities including claudication, muscle fatigue, or finger necrosis. Hypotension is a rare presentation of subclavian stenosis with very few literature reports [5–7].Diagnosis of SCA stenosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion in patients with symptoms of coronary subclavian steal syndrome or vertebrobasilar insufficiency. The measurement of bilateral brachial blood pressure should be the first evaluation if this condition is suspected. A difference of over 15 mm Hg is considered significant and is suggestive of unilateral subclavian stenosis, with sensitivity and specificity of 50% and 90%, respectively [8]. Consensus guidelines on the management of arterial hypertension recommend the evaluation of blood pressure between both arms [9, 10]. As shown in our case, bilateral subclavian artery stenosis can be missed when the blood pressure measurement is similar between both arms. This raises the question of how many asymptomatic bilateral subclavian stenosis cases we are missing in clinical practice.In select patients, we believe that the comparison of upper extremity blood pressure to lower extremity blood pressure can aid in the diagnosis. Unfortunately, obtaining lower extremity blood pressure is not a routine clinical practice. Our patient had chronic peripheral vascular disease which equally distorted her lower extremity blood pressure and made the diagnosis even more challenging. Delayed or decreased amplitude pulses and bruits in the subclavicular fossa are physical findings which could be a clue to SCA stenosis.Our initial diagnostic differential diagnosis included sepsis, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, endocrine etiologies such as hypothyroidism or hypoadrenalism, abdominal compartment syndrome, and Takayasu arteritis. Based on the elevated cardiac enzymes and the newly decreased ejection fraction, concern for perioperative myocardial infarction was on top of our differential diagnosis, hence the cardiac catheterization. Though angiogram is the gold standard to determine vascular stenosis, the diagnosis of SCA stenosis can be made through noninvasive imaging modalities such as duplex ultrasound, continuous flow Doppler, computed tomography angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography. Though our patient did have a CTA, the primary indication was to perform assessment for pulmonary embolism rather than imaging the subclavian arteries.Subclavian artery stenosis is associated with increased cardiovascular and overall mortality [3]. In projecting data from peripheral artery disease, it is suspected that patients with SCA stenosis benefit from aggressive secondary prevention. We encouraged our patient to continue aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, all of which she was already taking due to her history of coronary artery disease. She was also counselled on smoking cessation and weight loss.There is no data to support preemptive revascularization in asymptomatic patients. Schillinger et al. compared medical therapy to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of SCA stenosis in terms of long-term hemodynamic and symptomatic outcome [11]. The risk of symptomatic stenosis was found to be nonsignificant at 42-month follow-up. However, it should be noted that medical therapy has improved significantly since the study. In patients with symptomatic subclavian artery stenosis, angioplasty plus stenting was found to be superior to angioplasty alone or bypass in terms of asymptomatic survival and freedom from reintervention [12].This case highlights the importance of having a high index of suspicion for bilateral subclavian artery stenosis in a patient presenting with refractory hypotension and known peripheral vascular disease. As we highlighted above, pseudohypotension could mask clinically significant hypertension and this could contribute to an elevated risk of cardiovascular events.The patient described in the case report has given her informed consent for the case report to be published.The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Loperamide Induced Life Threatening Ventricular Arrhythmia
Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Department of Medicine, Jamaica, NY 11418,  USAReceived 11 April 2016; Revised 24 June 2016; Accepted 10 July 2016Academic Editor: Konstantinos P. LetsasCopyright © 2016 Ankit Upadhyay et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Loperamide is over-the-counter antidiarrheal agent acting on peripherally located μ opioid receptors. It is gaining popularity among drug abusers as opioid substitute. We report a case of a 46-year-old male that was presented after cardiac arrest. After ruling out ischemia, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, central nervous system pathology, sepsis, and other drug toxicity, we found out that patient was using around 100 mg of Loperamide to control his chronic diarrhea presumably because of irritable bowel syndrome for last five years and consumed up to 200 mg of Loperamide daily for last two days before the cardiac arrest. We hypothesize that the patient’s QTc prolongation and subsequent cardiac arrest are due to Loperamide toxicity. Patient experienced gradual resolution of tachyarrhythmia and gradual decrease in QTc interval during hospitalization which supports the evidence of causal relationship between Loperamide overdose and potentially fatal arrhythmias. It also provided the clue that patient may have congenital long QT syndrome which was unmasked by Loperamide causing ventricular arrhythmias. This case adds one more pearl in the literature to support that Loperamide overdose related cardiac toxicity does exist and it raises concerns over Loperamide abuse in the community.Drug overdose related cardiac toxicity and arrhythmia are well described in the literature and various drugs are responsible for causing life threatening ventricular arrhythmias [1]. Loperamide is over-the-counter antidiarrheal agent acting on peripherally located μ opioid receptors. We report an uncommon potentially fatal side effect of Loperamide ingestion in massive dose, a case of life threatening ventricular arrhythmia associated with Loperamide overdose.46-year-old male was presented in the ER after cardiac arrest. Patient had two-hour flight before he started feeling light-headed and passed out at the airport. The airport emergency services found him in ventricular fibrillation and provided him with two shocks before he regained consciousness. Subsequent EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and prolonged QT (QTc-589 msec); EKG is not available. Upon arrival to ER, patient was alert and oriented but amnesic about past events. Patient was taken for cardiac catheterization which revealed nonobstructive coronaries and normal ejection fraction. Electrolytes were unremarkable except potassium of 3.1 which was replaced. Complete blood counts, renal function, serum troponin, and serum magnesium were within normal limits. MRI of brain revealed no significant abnormalities. Shortly after coronary angiogram, patient again went to cardiac arrest and resuscitated with one shock. Cardiac monitor showed torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (Figure 1) with hemodynamic instability. Patient was intubated for airway protection and received IV magnesium and IV amiodarone. Toxicology screen was unremarkable except benzodiazepine he received during intubation (midazolam) for sedation. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, nonspecific ST-T wave abnormality, and prolonged QT (QTc-620 msec) (Figure 2). Echocardiogram revealed structurally normal heart. Acute pulmonary embolism was also ruled out with computed tomography pulmonary angiogram. Patient’s spouse reported that patient has been taking large amount of Loperamide for irritable bowel syndrome for more than 5 years. However, she was not able to quantify the amount of Loperamide. Patient persistently experienced multiple episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia requiring multiple defibrillation in setting of significantly prolonged QTc (>600 msec) on multiple serial EKGs. Patient was treated with metoprolol, lidocaine, and magnesium infusion. Over the period of 7 days, patient stopped having sustained ventricular tachycardia. Frequency of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was also reduced and patient was extubated after several days of CCU monitoring. Lidocaine and magnesium were discontinued and metoprolol was continued. Loperamide levels were not obtained. After extubation, patient denied having similar episode in the past, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, shortness of breath, and any family history of sudden cardiac death or cardiac diseases. However, patient admitted that he has been self-medicating with over-the-counter 2 mg Loperamide approximately 50 tablets a day for diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome for more than 5 years. He also admitted having approximately 100 pills of Loperamide daily for the last 2 days before admission. Since patient was buying over-the-counter Loperamide from different pharmacy; we could not determine exact frequency of purchase. Patient denied using illicit drug use, herbal supplements, or concurrent p-glycoprotein inhibitors. Serial EKG monitoring showed gradual decrease in QTc. However, serial EKG monitoring off Loperamide for several days revealed normal sinus rhythm and QTc of 472 msec (Figure 3) and 456 msec (Figure 4). Only one EKG revealed QTc of 432 msec (Figure 5). Thus, patient’s QTc interval did not completely normalize after several days off all QTc prolonging medications and subsequently he received dual chamber automated cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) before discharge for secondary prevention of cardiac arrhythmia related death. Since majority of patient’s QTc interval was >440 msec even after a week of stopping all QT prolonging medications, at this time, we think that patient may have subclinical long QT syndrome which was unmasked by Loperamide. However, electrophysiological studies were not performed to verify the diagnosis. Patient was instructed not to use Loperamide again.Loperamide has been increasingly recognized as opiate substitute. In a web based study, Daniulaityte et al. concluded that large doses of Loperamide are being used among drug abusers to alleviate opioid withdrawal symptoms [2]. There have been few case reports of life threatening ventricular tachycardia including torsades de pointes attributed to Loperamide overdose [3–7]. Dosage of Loperamide varied in all cases reported ranging from 60 mg up to 400 mg daily, which were dangerously exceeding recommended dose of 16 mg per day. All reported cases had significantly prolonged QTc. QTc prolongation occurs due to disturbances of repolarization activity of cardiac muscle. Although numbers of hypotheses exist in the current literature, the exact mechanism of Loperamide causing QTc prolongation is unknown till date. At therapeutic doses, Loperamide acts on peripheral μ receptors to produce antidiarrheal effects. Moreover, Reynolds et al. [8] described that Loperamide induces verapamil-like effect by blocking calcium channels in animal models. At extremely high doses, Loperamide may produce cardiac toxicity by delaying repolarization [5]. In one in vitro study, methadone and terfenadine are linked to QTc prolongation via inhibition of cardiac human ether-a-go-go potassium channel [9, 10]. Loperamide demonstrates structural similarities with methadone and terfenadine by having multiple phenyl rings [9]. Therefore, it can be assumed that Loperamide exerts its QTc prolongation effect and ultimately cardiac arrhythmias through similar mechanism. However, integrity of this proposed mechanism is yet to be verified. Since there is paucity of the data in the literature regarding Loperamide related cardiac toxicity, it is unclear at what doses Loperamide starts affecting the cardiac action potential.Based on patient’s history of chronic Loperamide use in excessive amount (no evidence of other causes of patient’s presentation), we hypothesize that there is a temporal relationship between Loperamide abuse and ventricular arrhythmias. During serial monitoring of QTc interval, a gradual decrease in QTc interval to borderline level also indicates that patient may have subclinical congenital long QT syndrome which was unmasked by the QTc prolonging drug like Loperamide resulting in life threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes in our patient.Although there is no robust evidence regarding Loperamide induced cardiovascular toxicity, few case reports established temporal association between Loperamide overdose and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. If Loperamide is used in massive doses, it can induce arrhythmias that can be fatal. General population and clinicians should be aware of this potentially dangerous medication and its abuse potential. Future studies should focus on mechanism by which Loperamide causes the cardiac toxicity and dose response relationship.The authors confirm that there is no conflict of interests to disclose.
GuideLiner Catheter Use for Percutaneous Intervention Involving Anomalous Origin of a Single Coronary Trunk Arising from the Ascending Aorta
Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Citizens Medical Center, Saitama 331-0054,  JapanReceived 16 May 2016; Accepted 3 July 2016Academic Editor: Kuan-Rau ChiouCopyright © 2016 Mitsunari Matsumoto et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Cases in which an anomalous single coronary trunk arises from the ascending aorta are extremely rare. In percutaneous coronary intervention for the lesion of a coronary artery anomaly, several problems may occur, including selection of a guide catheter, insufficient backup force, and difficulties of stent delivery. The GuideLiner catheter, which is a coaxial guide extension having the advantage of rapid exchange, facilitates coronary intervention for complex lesions. We report a case of angina having a lesion in the left anterior descending artery of a single coronary trunk arising from the ascending aorta. We successfully performed revascularization by using the GuideLiner catheter.Coronary artery anomalies are a diverse group of congenital disorders with many variations. Coronary artery anomalies of anomalous origin are uncommon but are occasionally encountered in clinical practice, with an incidence of 0.3–5% [1, 2]. In addition, a single coronary trunk is also rare, with an incidence of 0.12% [3]. We experienced an extremely rare case involving a single coronary trunk arising anomalously from the ascending aorta. This patient’s unusual anatomy led to several problems, including selection of the guide catheter, insufficient backup force, and difficulties of stent delivery in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We report a rare case with a single coronary trunk of anomalous origin that was successfully treated using the GuideLiner catheter (Vascular Solutions, MN, USA).A 65-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital complaining of chest oppression during light exertion. The patient’s coronary risk factors included hypertension and dyslipidemia. His serum creatinine level was 1.22 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate was 47 mL/min/1.73 m2. An electrocardiogram obtained at rest showed sinus rhythm and no significant ST-T change. Echocardiography showed normal function and normal chamber size. He underwent coronary angiography via the transradial approach to estimate cardiac ischemia.Coronary angiography showed no vessel arising from each coronary sinus. Aortography showed that the coronary trunk was originating from the ascending aorta (Figure 1(a)). A 5-Fr diagnostic Amplatz Left-1 (AL-1) catheter was engaged and demonstrated a single coronary trunk (Figure 1(b)). In order to stabilize the diagnostic catheter, a 0.014-inch guide wire was advanced into the septal branch of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The middle segment of the LAD was critically stenosed (Figure 1(c)). The lesion in the middle of the LAD was considered the cause of the patient’s symptoms; then we planned to perform PCI via the transfemoral approach at a later date.Figure 2 shows the results of the PCI performed on this patient. We failed to engage the anomalous orifice of the coronary trunk by using a 6-Fr AL-1 guiding catheter (Boston Scientific, MN, USA). Therefore, we utilized a 5-Fr diagnostic AL-1 catheter to engage the coronary trunk and a 0.014-inch floppy guide wire (Sion blue®, Asahi Intecc, Aichi, Japan) was advanced into the distal portion of the LAD (Figure 2(a)). After extending the guide wire, we removed the diagnostic catheter and left only the guide wire (Figure 2(b)). A 1.5 mm semicompliance balloon in the lead, along with a mother-child system, including a 6-Fr AL-1 guide catheter and a GuideLiner catheter, was advanced close to the orifice of the coronary trunk (Figure 2(c)). Then, the GuideLiner catheter was selectively inserted into the left coronary artery by anchoring it coaxially with the 1.5 mm balloon (Figure 2(d)). In order to avoid coronary dissection, contrast medium was gently injected using a manual method.　After dilatation with a 2.5 mm semicompliance balloon (Figure 2(e)), we have implanted the bioresorbable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent (Ultimaster , TERUMO, Tokyo, Japan) under the intravascular ultrasound guide (Figure 2(f)). The stent was additionally dilated with a noncompliance balloon  (Figure 2(g)). A final angiogram showed adequate and favorable dilatation of the culprit lesion (Figure 2(g)). During the procedure, the volume of contrast medium used was 75 mL, and the radiation exposure dose was 0.78 Gy.Using the GuideLiner catheter, we successfully treated a rare case of angina with a single coronary trunk arising anomalously from the ascending aorta. During PCI for a lesion with coronary anomalies, several problems are encountered, including selection of an appropriate guiding catheter, insufficient backup force, and difficulties in device delivery. We believe that the use of GuideLiner catheter could help to resolve these problems.The GuideLiner catheter, which has been available in Japan since 2014, is a rapid exchange “mother-child” guide extension that permits deep and selective intubation of the vessel. The conventional “mother-child” system is usually complicated because of its over-the-wire system, and there is sometimes concern about the length of the device such as guide wire, balloon, or stent when using the conventional system. The GuideLiner catheter has three merits for its use: deep seating for additional backup support to facilitate device delivery, coaxial alignment if there is failed engagement of the guiding catheter coaxiality, and reducing contrast volume by selective injection [4–6]. Because the GuideLiner catheter provides backup support, this device is generally utilized for lesions involving calcification or/and coronary tortuosity. In addition, when it is difficult to select an appropriate guiding catheter selection due to an anomalous origin of the coronary artery, the GuideLiner catheter is thought to be effective. In our case, although we failed to engage the AL-1 guiding catheter by the conventional method, the GuideLiner catheter could be selectively introduced to the coronary artery by using a balloon anchor technique. Moreover, in cases involving a single coronary trunk, this device can facilitate subselective visualization of the targeted coronary arteries and therefore has a potential use in minimizing contrast delivery during PCI. The volume of contrast medium during PCI in our case was 75 mL, and follow-up assessment confirmed the absence of contrast-induced nephropathy. Although the GuideLiner catheter has been useful for complex PCI, we should be careful to prevent vessel injury and dissection [7]. Especially in a case with a single coronary trunk, we should use the GuideLiner catheter with extreme caution during the procedure to avoid the coronary dissection and ischemia induced by deep seating. Our practice is to deliver the GuideLiner catheter over an anchoring balloon catheter and to carefully inject the contrast medium manually through the GuideLiner. Finally, we should ensure that there has been no proximal trauma and dissection.We experienced an extremely rare case with single coronary trunk arising from the ascending aorta. In complex PCI for anomalous coronary arteries, the GuideLiner catheter is useful in facilitating deep seating and for increasing backup force.All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

Fractional Flow Reserve Assessment of a Significant Coronary Stenosis Masked by a Downstream Serial Lesion
Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mackay Memorial Hospital Hsinchu, No. 690 Section 2, Guangfu Road, Hsinchu 30071,  TaiwanReceived 31 January 2016; Revised 29 May 2016; Accepted 3 July 2016Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2016 Lawrence Yu-Min Liu et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Fractional flow reserve (FFR) has been recognized as an effective tool to determine functional significance in intermediate coronary lesions and FFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) improves clinical outcomes. However, hemodynamic interaction between serial stenoses within one coronary artery complicates the assessment of functional severity of each individual lesion. We present a case in which FFR measurement by intracoronary bolus injection of adenosine helps to make appropriate revascularization decision in serial stenoses when the procedures are performed systemically and properly. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) has been recognized as an effective tool to determine functional significance in intermediate coronary lesions. FFR is defined as the ratio between mean distal coronary pressure and mean aortic pressure at maximal hyperemia. A 0.014-inch wire with pressure sensor tip is introduced and advanced across the target lesions. The FFR value is measured after continuous intravenous infusion or intracoronary bolus injection of adenosine to induce maximal coronary artery vasodilatation. Several landmark outcome trials showed that FFR-guided PCI significantly reduced major adverse cardiac events including death and urgent revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease [1, 2]. Functionally insignificant lesions can also be safely treated with optimal medical therapy and unnecessary PCI might be avoided. Current practice guidelines recommend utilization of FFR to identify functionally significant lesions in intermediate lesions and a cutoff of FFR ≤ 0.8 is used to guide coronary revascularization [3, 4]. Nevertheless, identifying which lesions are functionally significant is more challenging in vessels with serial or multiple stenoses. Understanding of the basic physiology and knowledge of FFR methods are important to the correct interpretation of the measurements, especially in complex lesions. We herein present a case in which FFR helps to guide appropriate PCI treatment in a single coronary artery with serial stenoses.A 67-year-old male with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia had a 2-month history of effort angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class 3). Echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy and normal systolic function with ejection fraction of 67%. Myocardial perfusion scan revealed a large area of myocardial ischemia at the lateral and inferior segments of left ventricle (Figure 1). Invasive coronary angiography demonstrated a critical stenosis in the mid left circumflex artery, which was stented with a drug-eluting stent. There were also an intermediate coronary lesion in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) and a very severe stenosis 40 mm downstream of the proximal lesion. A 0.014-inch FFR pressure wire (PressureWire, St. Jude Medical, Uppsala, Sweden) was advanced beyond both lesions and intracoronary boluses of adenosine were given to achieve maximal hyperemia. FFR was 0.6 after administration of 48 μg of intracoronary adenosine and FFR became 0.92 after 96 μg of intracoronary adenosine when the pressure sensor was pulled back and positioned between the two lesions (Figure 2). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using a drug-eluting stent for the distal stenosis was performed. Repeat FFR after PCI measured precisely at the previous position between the two lesions decreased significantly to 0.7 after 48 μg of intracoronary adenosine (Figure 3). PCI using a drug-eluting stent for the proximal intermediate lesion was therefore performed. Subsequent FFR in the distal RCA was 0.87 after both lesions were treated (Figure 4). The patient was discharged the following day and free of symptoms after one year.This case demonstrates that measurement of FFR in an intermediate lesion is critical in guiding PCI but can be easily misinterpreted in the presence of a serial lesion in the same artery.When serial or multiple stenoses are present in the same coronary artery, hemodynamic interaction between stenoses complicates the assessment of functional severity of individual lesions. FFR value of each stenosis is usually underestimated and this influence is more pronounced for the proximal lesion than for the distal one. Individual FFR of each stenosis can be predicted by the following equation: FFR predicted =  [5]. The equation uses arterial pressure (), pressure between the two stenoses (), distal pressure (), and coronary occlusion wedge pressure () during maximum hyperemia. The higher coronary wedge pressure created by a more severe distal lesion results in an even more pronounced underestimation for the proximal lesion as our case evidently displayed. Nonetheless, FFR remains a helpful tool to improve PCI outcomes and reduce unnecessary intervention in these complex lesions. Kim et al. studied a total of 131 patients with multiple intermediate stenoses and 182 out of the 298 lesions were deferred according to FFR measurements. There were no events related to the deferred lesion at follow-up [6].Most of the FFR studies were performed with a continuous intravenous administration of adenosine at a rate 140 μg/kg/min [7]. Previous reports on serial stenoses within one coronary artery also advocated intravenous infusion of adenosine and pullback pressure tracing to induce maximal hyperemia and to identify functionally significant lesions. This approach is especially effective to recognize all significant pressure gradients in serial or diffuse lesions. However, it is paramount to repeat FFR measurement after treatment of the first targeted lesion to avoid missing other significant lesions that might be influenced or underestimated during the first measurement. Although we utilized a different approach using intracoronary adenosine to achieve maximal hyperemia, we followed the same measurement principle by performing repeat FFR after each treatment, which also yielded excellent angiographic and FFR results.Despite the recommended use of intravenous route of adenosine administration, intracoronary adenosine is still frequently used in clinical practice and published data [8]. Intracoronary adenosine is found to be associated with reduced procedural time and improved patient comfort at a lower cost without sacrificing FFR accuracy and patient safety [9]. In our case, a relatively lower dose of intracoronary adenosine was started to induce maximal hyperemia. If FFR was greater than 0.8 at the initial dose, we increased the dose of adenosine until FFR value did not change with the higher dose. De Luca et al. showed that high doses of intracoronary adenosine increased the sensitivity of FFR [10]. Another study further specified an intracoronary adenosine bolus injection of 100 μg in the RCA and 200 μg in the LCA induced maximum hyperemia while being associated with minimal side effects [11].A recent development in functional measurement of coronary stenosis using a hyperemia-free, pressure-derived hemodynamic index can potentially mitigate problems associated with hyperemic FFR in serial lesions. Instant wave-free ratio (iFR) is a resting index calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to proximal aortic pressure over a specific wave-free period in diastole. During this cardiac cycle, resistance is naturally constant and minimized without administration of vasodilator drugs. This resting index measured at basal state can eliminate the flow interaction between stenoses under hyperemia. An iFR-pullback method can create a physiological map in complex serial stenoses and diffuse vessels and predict an expected iFR value for the treatment of selected stenosis [12, 13]. Moreover, using a hybrid iFR-FFR strategy can free 65.1% of patients and 69.1% of stenoses from hyperemia and greatly simplify functional assessment during PCI [14].This case highlighted the importance of FFR in evaluating intermediate lesion and how it could be easily misinterpreted if operators are not familiar with this diagnostic tool. It also demonstrated that FFR measurement using intracoronary adenosine in serial lesions is a feasible and timesaving approach if correct and necessary procedures are performed systemically.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Background. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is sudden and reversible myocardial dysfunction often attributable to physical or emotional triggers. Case Report. We describe a 51-year-old man presented to emergency department with sepsis from urinary tract infection (UTI). He was placed on cefepime for UTI and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction protocol given elevated troponins with chest pain. Subsequently, patient was pulseless with torsades de pointes (TdP) and then converted to sinus rhythm with cardioversion. An echocardiogram revealed low ejection fraction with hypokinesis of the apical wall. Over 48 hours, the patient was extubated and stable on 3 L/min nasal cannula. He underwent a cardiac catheterization to evaluate coronary artery disease (CAD) and was found to have mild nonobstructive CAD with no further findings. Conclusion. TCM is a rare disorder presenting with symptoms similar to acute coronary syndrome. Though traditionally elicited by physical and emotional triggers leading to transient left ventricular dysfunction, our case suggests that it may also be triggered by a urinary tract infection and lead to severe QT prolongation and a malignant ventricular arrhythmia in TdP.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is an abrupt and often unpredictable presentation of an acute heart failure syndrome with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath, often triggered by an emotionally or physically stressful event. The disease is characterized by transient systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction with a diverse range of described wall motion abnormalities [1]. TCM, also known as broken-heart syndrome, is most often seen in elderly women, with Asians being the largest group affected. It presents with some sort of emotional or physical trigger leading to symptoms of acute coronary syndrome including chest pain, shortness of breath accompanied by echocardiographic findings, and biomarker profiles suggesting TCM. Although it has been observed worldwide over the past 26 years since its original description in Japan, there is still much that is unknown about this acute illness [2]. We would like to present a case of sepsis-induced TCM leading to QTc prolongation which in turn led to a malignant ventricular arrhythmia in torsades de pointes (TdP). In the literature search, there are cases presented with TCM and TdP; however, there is no case report mentioning of sepsis-induced TCM leading to TdP.We present a case of a 51-year-old white man who initially presented with substernal chest pain to the emergency department and was found to be in sepsis. Upon presentation, the patient was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive, accompanied by a leukocytosis. He was diagnosed with sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI). Urine cultures were sent but empiric treatment was begun with cefepime based on his previous history of recurrent urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensitive to cefepime.On admission, cardiac biomarkers were also sent for analysis and troponin ultra was found to be elevated to 3.312 ng/mL (reference range 0.006–0.06 ng/mL), without any ST-T wave changes. On admission, leukocyte counts were elevated 15,800/μL and also lactate was 2.1 mmol/L. The patient was subsequently admitted to the coronary care unit and placed on aspirin, clopidogrel, and enoxaparin, treating him for a possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. The patient was not started on a beta-blocker due to hypotension. Since admission, the patient had progressive T wave changes (Figures 1 and 2).For the purpose of this case, the patient’s past medical history consisted of a neurogenic bladder with recurrent UTIs, recurrent deep vein thrombosis on coumadin, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. After the patient was admitted to the coronary care unit, the patient was found to be in torsades de pointes (TdP) pulseless polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Figure 3). The patient was successfully electrically cardioverted. After cardioversion, T wave inversions worsened with evidence of prolonged QTc (Figure 4). The patient was intubated to maintain and protect airways.Subsequently, the patient was started on pressor support to maintain his mean arterial pressure greater than 65 mmHg. The following day, his mental status improved and he was tolerating a continuous positive airway pressure trial. He was then extubated and found to be stable on 3 L nasal cannula.After the patient was hemodynamically stable, the plan was to gather more information on the underlying nature behind his TdP and long QT. The patient was scheduled for a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and a cardiac catheterization the following day. The TTE revealed a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (25%–30%) with apical wall motion abnormalities consistent with a great likelihood of classic takotsubo cardiomyopathy, the apical type (Figure 5). A coronary angiogram was performed a few days later and did not show any significant coronary artery disease (Figure 6).This case shows TCM in the setting of sepsis secondary to UTI. Urine culture was positive for Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli on day 3 of admission and blood cultures were negative. We believe that the TCM in this patient led to a malignant ventricular rhythm in TdP, which eventually needed direct current cardioversion to resolve. The patient’s hospital course was stable following the treatment, with a resolving white cell count and a treated UTI. The patient was discharged with a life vest. Patient had repeated echocardiogram three months later and left ventricular ejection fraction improved to >55% without any wall motion abnormality (Figure 7).Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM), also known as broken-heart syndrome, was first described more than 25 years ago; however, it has still not been completely understood. TCM is usually an acute, distinct cardiomyopathy with transient left ventricular dysfunction and mimics myocardial infarction without significant coronary obstruction [1, 3, 4]. However, TCM may have relevant coronary artery obstruction but the extent of myocardial dysfunction far exceeds the culprit stenotic lesion or it can be different stenotic lesion compared to the myocardial dysfunction [1, 5]. Its symptomology (chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath) overlaps with that of acute coronary syndrome and therefore is a serious medical event [4]. Original reports on TCM done in Japan, the United States, and Western Europe describe individuals with transient left ventricular dysfunction but the condition was not described as a separate condition until Japanese clinicians did so in the 1990s [1].Based on EKG findings, elevated cardiac enzymes, and ACS symptoms, a clinical and lab-based diagnosis of TCM is difficult, because ACS cannot be ruled out. It is usually a reversible event and serial echocardiogram assessments show improvement in left ventricular function. Physical and emotional disturbances trigger TCM 36% and 27.7% of the time, respectively, although, in 28.5% of cases, an identifiable trigger can be absent [1]. The condition usually follows a physical or emotional stressor thought to be a reaction to catecholamine-mediated myocardial stunning [1, 6]. In addition, physical stress is more common in male patients [6]; in this patient, sepsis can be considered a physical trigger.Although TCM is thought to be a benign and reversible condition, it has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality even though the majority cases of TCM show no angiographic evidence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease [7]. In comparison with acute coronary syndrome, in-hospital complications were similar, about 21.8% [1].It is the repolarization abnormalities associated with TCM that have been linked to arrhythmias and associated with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias [6, 8]. Atrial fibrillation was the most common arrhythmia, reported in 4.7% of cases, with sinus node dysfunction (in 1.3% cases), atrioventricular nodal dysfunction (including complete heart block in 2.9% cases), and life threatening ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation in 3.4% cases [6]. The direct effect of catecholamines, dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, and oxidative stress are thought to be the contributing factors for the ventricular arrhythmia [6].TCM has a clinical profile similar to acute coronary syndrome especially in an electrical sense, often initially presenting with ST changes and in the following 24–48 hours presenting with T wave inversions and QT prolongation [6, 9]. For this reason, studies have shown that TCM should be considered a cause of acquired long QT syndrome [6, 9]. Brown et al. [6] described a study showing that there was 8.6% prevalence of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias in patients presenting with TCM. The TCM patients with adverse ventricular arrhythmias as a result presented with a longer QTc on admission and their QT prolongation was more severe as their hospital course progressed [9, 10].In patients with TCM, there are many risk factors, including genetic, which predispose the person to a prolonged QT interval. For example, a genetic predisposition is present in those with congenital long QT syndrome. This is a syndrome that undoubtedly predisposes a patient to a malignant ventricular rhythm, regardless of whether they have TCM or not, to develop TdP. In addition, electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia (defined as <3.5 mmol/L) and severe hypomagnesemia (defined as <1 mg/dL), have been associated greatly with TCM, and recent conversion of atrial fibrillation to a sinus rhythm [11] and administering QT prolonging agents have all been well-studied risk factors for TdP among TCM patients. These electrolyte abnormalities were present in patients with TCM and were therefore a great contributor to the development of TdP; however our patient’s comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable for significant electrolyte abnormalities. In addition, cefepime and other cephalosporins have not been shown to prolong QT and are a much safer option than antimicrobials from the macrolides and quinolones families [12].Though TCM has been linked to QT prolongation and torsades de pointes (TdP) [6, 9], there have not been any clear case reports linking a sepsis-induced TCM that lead to QT prolongation and TdP.Our patient presented to the emergency department with substernal chest pain and was found to be in sepsis. Within 24 hours of admission, the patient was in TdP. Initially, we could not determine the cause of the steep decline in the patient’s cardiac status and it was believed to be ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, transthoracic echocardiography revealed classic apical TCM and gave us a source for the prolonged QT and TdP. The patient’s urinary tract infection was the source of his systemic bacterial infection and sepsis, which, we believe, led to a stress-induced cardiomyopathy and TdP. At hospitals without cardiac catheterization laboratories, a high index of suspicion is required to diagnose TCM [13].The patient was diagnosed with TCM on the basis of the Mayo Clinic diagnostic criteria, of which 3 out of the 4 required diagnostic criteria were met with tested evidence and the fourth criterion was met through clinical judgment. The patient had (1) transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a markedly reduced ejection fraction, with hypokinesia and wall motion abnormalities; (2) an absence of acute obstructive coronary disease as cardiac catheterization which showed no evidence of acute plaque rupture or acute coronary syndrome; (3) new electrocardiographic abnormalities including T wave inversions and a prolonged QT interval with a modest elevation in cardiac troponin. The last diagnostic criterion (4) includes excluding pheochromocytoma and myocarditis as an underlying cause of the patient’s presentation. Clinically, both these diagnoses were excluded. As the patient did not present with episodic hypertension, palpitations, and excessive diaphoresis, pheochromocytoma was clinically ruled out [14]. As the patient’s history did not consist of a recent viral illness, we had a lower suspicion for viral myocarditis. We understand that urine metanephrines, CT abdomen and pelvis, and viral titers could have been ordered to definitively rule out these two conditions before making the diagnosis of TCM; however, our clinical suspicion was low and the acute treatment of our patient was of greater concern. It is important to note that coronary artery disease can be considered nonsignificant in the absence of ≥50% diameter stenoses by visual assessment and angiography [7]. As a result, it is true that nonsignificant coronary artery disease may be present in the presence of TCM; however, this is a finding that is less common (15%) compared to the 85% of TCM patients having normal coronary arteries [7].This unique presentation of our patient, initially presenting with sepsis, later progressing to takotsubo cardiomyopathy, subsequently leading to cardioelectrophysiological decompensation and torsades de pointes, illustrated the presence of this very important cause of an acute heart failure syndrome. Moreover, not only can takotsubo cardiomyopathy present with symptoms similar to acute coronary syndrome, but also a clinical presentation in a man without a physical or emotional trigger cannot rule out the complexity of this disease process. Although the pathogenesis of this condition is still not widely accepted, it is important to bear in mind TCM’s resemblance to acute coronary syndrome and the potentially lethal complications of this clinical syndrome.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Amphetamine Containing Dietary Supplements and Acute Myocardial Infarction
1Department of Internal Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL 32209,  USA2Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL 32209,  USAReceived 17 March 2016; Revised 17 June 2016; Accepted 20 June 2016Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2016 Julio Perez-Downes et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Weight loss is one of the most researched and marketed topics in American society. Dietary regimens, medications that claim to boost the metabolism, and the constant pressure to fit into society all play a role in our patient’s choices regarding new dietary products. One of the products that are well known to suppress appetite and cause weight loss is amphetamines. While these medications suppress appetite, most people are not aware of the detrimental side effects of amphetamines, including hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, and in certain instances acute myocardial infarction. Here we present the uncommon entity of an acute myocardial infarction due to chronic use of an amphetamine containing dietary supplement in conjunction with an exercise regimen. Our case brings to light further awareness regarding use of amphetamines. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion of use of these substances when young patients with no risk factors for coronary artery disease present with acute arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarctions. Amphetamines are widely known to cause appetite suppression and encourage weight loss. Their other known side effects are hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarctions [1]. Herein we describe the case of a 35-year-old female who was undergoing a weight loss regimen of daily exercise with a dietary supplement who subsequently suffered an acute myocardial infarction and was found to test positive for amphetamines.A 35-year-old African American female with no prior history of coronary artery disease and no significant family history presented with sudden onset of exertional chest discomfort with radiation to the back. The patient became unresponsive shortly after arrival to the emergency department and was subsequently found to be in ventricular fibrillation-cardiac arrest (V-fib). The patient was in V-fib for 6 minutes, with conversion after electrical cardioversion and subsequent development of PEA-arrest for a total of 4 minutes. Repeat EKG after return of spontaneous circulation demonstrated inferolateral STEMI (Figure 1). The patient received tenecteplase and heparin prior to urgent transfer to the catheterization laboratory. Left heart catheterization showed 99% thrombotic occlusion of mid-distal LAD (Figures 2 and 3). Two overlapping drug eluting stents (Xience RX 2.5 mm and Xience RX 2.75 mm) were placed in the distal LAD, and TIMI III flow was achieved (Figure 4). Due to severely decreased ventricular function with ejection fraction of 10–15%, the patient received ventricular support with an Impella, with discontinuation soon after secondary to hemolysis. Further evaluation revealed positive toxicology screen for amphetamines. Pertinent laboratory results for possible autoimmune causes of the acute myocardial infarction were negative, including antinuclear antibody (ANA), ribonucleoprotein antibody (RNP), RA latex turbid, anti-chromatin IgG antibodies, SSA (Ro) and SSB (La) antibodies, and double stranded DNA antibody (dsDNA).The patient’s cardiac function recovered with medical management. Subsequent transthoracic echocardiograms revealed improved ejection fraction to 60–65% after 11 days and a new finding of left ventricular apical thrombus. The patient received anticoagulation with intravenous heparin, as well as continuous treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.The patient remained in the coronary care unit (CCU) for a total of 17 days. CCU course was further complicated by development of pulmonary edema with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and developing MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.Due to the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient received a tracheostomy and continued to improve in terms of her pulmonary function while treated with antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia. Her neurological status improved significantly, and on interview, she denied any use of Adderall, amphetamines, or illicit drugs that could have precipitated this event. She reported that recently she had increased her level of physical activity in order to lose weight and was supplementing such efforts with the addition of a natural weight loss dietary supplement.Amphetamine use is strongly associated with coronary artery disease [2]. The immediate cardiovascular effects of amphetamine use include tachycardia and hypertension, both of which are caused by the increase in circulation of catecholamines. These can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias and enhancement of coronary vascular tone, increase platelet aggregation, and ultimately promote plaque rupture with subsequent development of an acute myocardial infarction [1, 3]. The mechanism of myocardial injury due to amphetamine use is believed to be acute coronary vasospasm, with subsequent decreased perfusion and development of an acute myocardial infarction. Chronic use of amphetamines can also lead to accelerated atherosclerosis and increased thrombogenicity [4], both of which can lead to thromboocclusive acute coronary syndromes in young individuals. Bashour reported the first documented case of intracoronary thrombus as the culprit of acute myocardial infarction in a patient with amphetamine abuse. They postulated this increase in thrombogenicity to be secondary to catecholamine-induced platelet aggregation [5]. Westover and colleagues, in a cross-sectional study which evaluated the link between amphetamine abuse and incidence of acute myocardial infarction, revealed a significant association with amphetamine use and acute myocardial infarction in young adults (adjusted odds ratio = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.24–2.04, ) [6].There are multiple cases reported in the literature involving the development of an acute myocardial infarction due to amphetamine abuse. Chang and colleagues reported an unusual case of a silent ST elevation myocardial infarction following amphetamine use in a 61-year-old diabetic patient. In their case, the patient presented to the hospital without chest pain and normal cardiac enzymes; however, EKG revealed ST elevations in the inferior leads with reciprocal changes in the precordial leads. Subsequent percutaneous coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the posterior-lateral segment of the right coronary artery. On further history, the patient had reported abusing amphetamines via inhalation prior to presentation [7]. In a similar case, Waksman and colleagues reported the incidence of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction in a 31-year-old patient who was using amphetamine intravenously and presented to the hospital with generalized discomfort after 4 doses 48 hours prior to presentation [8]. On this particular case, myocardial infarction was diagnosed via electrocardiogram changes which were reported as T wave inversions in inferior and anterior leads, with subsequent transition to a new left bundle branch block in a repeat electrocardiogram 5 minutes after the prior. Conservative treatment was instituted and the patient subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit. Transthoracic echocardiogram 3 days after admission revealed decreased anterior wall motion as well as a reduced ejection fraction at 25%. The patient was unable to undergo cardiac catheterization due to leaving the hospital prematurely [8]. Watts and McCollester reported the case of a 23-year-old patient who presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain and generalized malaise less than 24 hours after inhalation of amphetamines. Electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in the precordial leads V1–V4, a junctional rhythm, and a complete heart block, with troponin I noted acutely elevated. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed normal coronaries and a decreased ejection fraction of 15–20% [9]. Subsequent clinical course included evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram revealing ventricular asynergy, placement of a dual chamber pacemaker, and a follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram revealing an improved ejection fraction of 35–40% and electrocardiogram revealing resolution of ST elevation [9]. An additional case reported in the literature by Furst and colleagues involves the case of a 41-year-old patient who presented to the hospital after use of intranasal methamphetamine with chest pain [3]. Electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in II, III, and AVF, with reciprocal changes in the precordial leads. The patient was initially treated with thrombolytics, with resolution of ST elevations and chest pain, but suffered a recurrence of chest pain 24 hours after treatment. Cardiac catheterization was performed which showed subtotal occlusion of the mid-segment of the right coronary artery, with the patient undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [3]. This case also illustrates how despite treatment the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction after amphetamine use remains a real concern. Turnipseed and colleagues, in a study that aimed at determining the frequency of acute coronary syndrome in patients presenting to the hospital with chest pain after methamphetamine use, concluded that acute coronary syndrome is common in patients presenting with chest pain after methamphetamine use as well as the fact that a normal electrocardiogram does not necessarily rule out the possibility of myocardial infarction in patients known to be methamphetamine abusers [10].One of the side effects of amphetamine use is decreased appetite, a side effect that is desirable to some patients. The realization of such effect and the potential for inducing weight loss led to the introduction of amphetamines as appetite suppressants in the 1950s and development of the combination of Phentermine and Fenfluramine in the 1990s [11]. The medication was approved and widely used in the early 1990s due to its significant effect in weight reduction. However, due to subsequent reports of increased cardiovascular events, the drug was withdrawn from the market in 1997 [12]. With the increased use of amphetamines for treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Adult Attention Deficit Disorder, there has been a substantial increase in their abuse due to the desirable side effect of decreased appetite and weight loss. In view of this side effect profile, manufacturers of dietary supplements marketed to promote weight loss are including β-Methylphenethylamine (B-Methyl), a positional isomer of amphetamine with a similar profile effect as amphetamines [13], in their dietary supplements. This compound, which is similar in structure and composition to amphetamine, can be detected in routine toxicology screens as amphetamine.In view of the positive toxicology screen for amphetamines and the lack of history of abuse or use by our patient, we propose the notion that weight loss dietary supplements in fact may contain amphetamines or amphetamine-like substances. With the popularity of such products among patients searching for aids in weight loss, there is a possibility that a portion of the population who regularly use these products might be exposed to unregulated levels of amphetamines or amphetamine-like substances. The acute and chronic consequences of use of these substances can be detrimental to patients, as they are at a higher risk for acute myocardial infarctions, increased risk of accelerated atherosclerosis, and early development of cardiac dysfunction due to recurrent myocardial injury [1, 4, 5, 12].Our case illustrates how inadvertent use of amphetamines by patients with no history, risk factors, or significant family history of coronary artery disease can be the culprit for life threatening events. Patients often struggle with weight management, looking for alternatives to supplement their efforts to lose weight. Without proper disclosure and recent trend of the addition of amphetamines to dietary supplements [13], it is important to educate patients and maintain a high index of suspicion when young adults present with acute myocardial infarction and have no history or laboratory values significant for illicit drug use. The detrimental effects of the use of such substances can be seen in the acute phase by myocardial infarctions and left ventricular dysfunction [3, 9] and potentially in the chronic phase by subsequent valvular heart disease and congestive heart failure [12].The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Successful Percutaneous Coronary Intervention through a Severely Bent Artificial Ascending Aorta Using the DIO Thrombus Aspiration Catheter
Department of Cardiology, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minami Koshigaya, Koshigaya City, Saitama 3438555,  JapanReceived 19 April 2016; Revised 13 June 2016; Accepted 23 June 2016Academic Editor: Takatoshi KasaiCopyright © 2016 Akinori Fujikake et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 66-year-old man was admitted to our institute because of chest pain. He had undergone replacement of the ascending aorta due to aortic dissection 9 years previously. We made a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, and coronary artery angiography was performed. Although the right coronary artery was successfully cannulated, a severe bend of the artificial aorta made it very difficult to advance the catheter into the left coronary artery. Ultimately, a DIO thrombus aspiration catheter was used to enter the left coronary artery, and a stent was implanted successfully. The DIO catheter is very useful when the selection of a guiding catheter is complicated, such as in the case of severe vessel tortuosity or a bend of the ascending aorta.Coronary artery disease is often accompanied by other vascular diseases. Selection of an appropriate guiding catheter is the most important determinant of procedural success in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, in cases of patients with diseases of the ascending aorta, it may be difficult to advance the guiding catheter into a coronary artery. We report a successful case of PCI performed through a severe bend of an artificial ascending aorta using the DIO thrombus aspiration catheter.A 66-year-old man was admitted to our institute because of chest pain. He had undergone replacement of the ascending aorta due to aortic dissection 9 years previously. His risk factors for coronary artery disease included hypertension and hemodialysis due to chronic nephrotic syndrome. An electrocardiogram taken on admission showed regular sinus rhythm with ST depression in leads V1–V5. Enhanced computed tomography of the chest revealed that the replaced artificial duct in the ascending aorta was severely bent (Figure 1). He was diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome and underwent coronary artery angiography (CAG) via a right femoral arterial approach. Selective cannulation of the right coronary artery was achieved with 4.2 Fr Judkins right 4.0 catheter. However, when selective cannulation of the left coronary artery was attempted, the catheter could not be controlled because of a severely bent duct in the ascending aorta. The left coronary artery could not be reached using a 4.2 Fr Judkins left 4.0 catheter, Judkins left 5.0 catheter, Amplatz 1.0 catheter, dual use catheter, or 6 Fr guiding catheter. As the next strategy, we first considered using a 4.2 Fr diagnostic catheter in a 6 Fr guiding catheter (mother-child technique). However, a 6 Fr guiding catheter could not advance beyond the severely bent part of the artificial ascending aorta due to its low profile. Next, we considered using a 4.2 Fr diagnostic catheter in a 5 Fr guiding catheter. However, we thought that a 4.2 Fr diagnostic catheter could not be controlled enough to engage the left coronary artery due to the unfavorable shape of the 5 Fr guiding catheter tip. In addition, the softer tip of DIO compared to 5 Fr guiding catheter seemed to be more suitable for this complex lesion which should need the deep engagement of guiding catheter.Finally, we decided to insert a 4.2 Fr dual use catheter into a DIO thrombus aspiration catheter (a straight catheter) to pass the artificial duct in the ascending aorta. Then, alternate manipulation of the DIO thrombus aspiration catheter and the angiographic catheter was very effective in advancing the two catheters through the artificial aorta, allowing these two catheters to be inserted into the left coronary artery. Selective injection of contrast revealed 99% stenosis at the midportion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery (Figure 2). After that, we advanced the DIO thrombus aspiration catheter forward deeply into the LAD artery, pulled out the angiographic catheter, and performed PCI using the DIO thrombus aspiration catheter as the guiding catheter. At this time, we inserted a 0.014 SION Blue guidewire (Asahi Intech Corp., Japan) through the 4.2 Fr diagnostic catheter into the coronary artery before pulling out the 4.2 Fr diagnostic catheter to prevent removal of the DIO from the coronary artery. IVUS evaluation was important for achieving optimal PCI to avoid the need for repeat PCI in this difficult case. We predilated the lesion with a  mm TREK Balloon Catheter (Abbott Vascular Co., Ltd., CA, USA) and engaged the DIO thrombus aspiration catheter into the LAD artery more deeply to gain more back-up support. Subsequently, an Eagle Eye IVUS Catheter (Eagle Eye: Volcano Corp., USA) was inserted to the midportion of the LAD artery. After that, stenting was accomplished with a  mm Xience Xpedition Stent (Abbott Vascular Co., Ltd., CA, USA) delivered at 14 atm. The residual stenosis was <5% (Figure 3). This excellent result was accomplished using the DIO thrombus aspiration catheter.After replacement of the ascending aorta, a severe bend in the aorta is a rare complication [1]. However, a severe bend in the ascending aorta with or without replacement can make it very difficult to perform PCI.There are three possible benefits of using the DIO catheter to perform PCI. First, substituting a DIO catheter for a long sheath can make it easy to control a diagnostic catheter for cannulation. Next, substituting a DIO catheter for a guiding catheter can shorten the PCI procedure, because it is not necessary to exchange the diagnostic catheter for a guiding catheter. Finally, strong back-up support can be achieved by deep engagement of the DIO catheter.Selecting an appropriate guiding catheter is the most important determinant of procedural success in PCI.　However, in this case, it was not possible to reach the left coronary ostium, even with the diagnostic catheter. We previously reported successful PCI of an anomalous right coronary artery using the DIO thrombus aspiration catheter [2]. The DIO thrombus aspiration catheter that includes a 4.2 Fr angiographic catheter has become available. Therefore, it is possible to engage the coronary artery by sliding the angiographic catheter through the DIO catheter. A tortuosity or severe bend of the ascending aorta is a serious problem when PCI is performed. In the case of a severe bend of the ascending aorta, it is not uncommon to kink the angiographic catheter, and the DIO thrombus aspiration catheter can provide strong support of the catheter without kinking. By inserting the DIO thrombus aspiration catheter into the ascending aorta, it is possible to operate the angiographic catheter more delicately.Sometimes, CAG followed by PCI becomes complex, and the duration of the procedure is prolonged because of the time required to select an adequate guiding catheter. By inserting a 4.2 Fr diagnostic catheter into the DIO thrombus aspiration catheter, it is possible to perform CAG and PCI consecutively and safely. Previously, the mother-child technique was useful in cases in which it was difficult to engage the guiding catheter or strong back-up was needed [3]. Recently, a GuideLiner® catheter (Vascular Solutions Inc., MN, USA) was used for the mother-child technique [4]. However, in the present case, we thought that this method would not be useful, because a guiding catheter could not be inserted through the severe bend in the ascending aorta. Therefore, the DIO thrombus aspiration catheter can be useful when selection of the guiding catheter is rather complicated, such as in the case of a severely bent aorta.Strong back-up support is one of the important determinants of PCI success. Generally, interventionists obtain back-up support by selecting the most appropriate French size or shape of the guiding catheter. A 7 or 8 Fr guiding catheter is rigid and could not be manipulated well in the present case. The DIO thrombus aspiration catheter allows coronary angiography and engages the coronary artery coaxially because of its softness. Moreover, strong back-up support can be obtained by deeply engaging the coronary artery. The DIO thrombus aspiration catheter allows balloon delivery, IVUS, and stenting of the distal portion of a vessel.In the case of a severe bend of the ascending aorta, it is difficult to pass a diagnostic catheter and perform PCI. The DIO thrombus aspiration catheter is useful for PCI as well as diagnosis.We report a successful case of PCI using a DIO thrombus aspiration catheter in a patient with a severe bend in the ascending aorta after aortic replacement. The DIO thrombus aspiration catheter is useful when selection of the guiding catheter is rather complicated, such as in the case of a severe bend of the ascending aorta.None of the authors identified having a conflict of interests.
Dexamethasone Associated ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Four Days after an Unremarkable Coronary Angiogram—Another Reason for Cautious Use of Steroids: A Case Report and Review of the Literature
1Internal Medicine Department, Detroit Medical Center/Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201,  USA2Cardiology Department, Detroit Medical Center/Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201,  USAReceived 3 May 2016; Accepted 20 June 2016Academic Editor: Antonio de Padua MansurCopyright © 2016 Mohamed Shokr et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Drug induced myocardial infarction is a known entity with different forms of steroids linked to coronary artery disease (CAD) either through promoting its traditional risk factors, inducing coronary spasm, or by other unidentified mechanisms. Dexamethasone is known to promote an atherogenic and hypercoagulable state. We report a case of a 75-year-old woman who had ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) associated with dexamethasone use just 4 days following an angiogram showing minor luminal irregularities.ST elevation myocardial infarction is a substantial health problem with estimated 30-day mortality between 2.5 and 10% [1]. Nontraditional risk factors play a significant role in more than 50% of CAD cases [2]. More than 150 drugs were reported as possible causes of acute MI. Betamethasone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone were among 39 drugs highlighted as prime suspects that can cause acute MI [3]. We report a case of STEMI associated with dexamethasone use 4 days following a coronary angiogram with only minor luminal irregularities.Our patient is a 75-year-old African-American woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and four prior cerebrovascular accidents with mild right sided residual weakness and ventral hernia status after surgical repair. She has no prior history of smoking, alcohol use, illicit drug use, or family history of premature coronary artery disease. She initially presented with shortness of breath, rhinorrhea, and cough productive of yellowish sputum and tested positive for influenza A for which she was started on oseltamivir. On her second day of hospitalization she reported mild retrosternal chest pain accompanied with a Troponin I elevation up to 0.3 ng/mL with an unchanged EKG showing right bundle branch block (RBBB) (Figure 1(a)). She received Aspirin, Clopidogrel, and Heparin drip in addition to Diltiazem and Atorvastatin as treatment for a NSTEMI.On the following day, she underwent a coronary angiogram revealing only minor luminal irregularities and no significant CAD (Figure 2(a)). Two days later, she underwent nasopharyngolaryngoscopy for progressive dysphonia that showed inflammatory changes of true and false vocal folds, mild granulation changes of the subglottis, and pachydermia. This was deemed secondary to her upper respiratory tract infection and the resulting acute tracheobronchitis. Subsequently, she was started on intramuscular dexamethasone 10 mg Q8 hours.One day later, she complained of severe retrosternal chest pain with a blood pressure of 90/65 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Cardiovascular exam was unremarkable revealing regular heart rate and normal S1 and S2 with no appreciated murmurs, rubs, or gallop. She had no JVD and clear lungs on auscultation. Distal pulses were well felt without appreciated lower extremity edema. The EKG however showed ST elevation in the anterior leads, V2 to V5 (Figure 1(b)). Bedside echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 30–35% and regional wall motion in the form of apical dyskinesis and severe hypokinesis in the mid to apical anteroseptal, anterior, apical inferior, inferoseptal, and lateral segments. Of note, the pre-MI echocardiogram showed a normal EF with no appreciated regional wall motion abnormalities. The Troponin I level was 0.1 ng/mL (cutoff value of 0.2 ng/mL). She was immediately transferred to the catheterization lab where the angiogram surprisingly revealed a filling defect, likely a thrombus, occluding the midsegment of the LAD (Figure 2(b)). Subsequently, a 2.5 × 18 mm drug eluting stent was deployed with pre- and postballoon dilation resulting in TIMI III flow (Figure 2(c)). Eptifibatide was started in addition to Ticagrelor, Aspirin, Deltiazem, and Atorvastatin. The chest pain resolved shortly after the intervention and the EKG returned to baseline (Figure 1(c)).Blood work revealed a platelet count of 461 k/cumm, hemoglobin of 10.5 mg/dL, and white blood cell count of 9 k/cumm. Homocysteine level was mildly elevated (15.5 micromoles/L, normal range 3.2–10.7). High sensitivity CRP was elevated at 40.9 mg/L. Factor VIII activity (325%, normal range: 63–150), factor XI activity (211%, normal range: 71–124), and thrombin antithrombin complex (13.7 ng/mL, normal range: 0.7–3.2) were all increased while factor VII activity was normal. Fibrinogen level and protein C and S activity were normal. Cardiolipin antibody, JAK2 V617F mutation, and Factor V Leiden were all negative.Besides impacting traditional risk factors for CAD such as hypertension (HTN), glucose intolerance, obesity, and hyperlipidemia (HLD), glucocorticoids influence vascular functions, atherogenesis, and remodeling following ischemia or intravascular injury. This influence is mediated by both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoid receptors and is modified by 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme local metabolism of glucocorticoids [4].Dexamethasone was shown to promote an atherogenic and hypercoagulable state through different mechanisms. In high doses, it increases Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) which is a prothrombotic marker and increases the platelet activator P-selectin. Moreover, short term use of dexamethasone is associated with increased levels of Fibrinogen, VII, VIII, and XI [5, 6].In 2014 Okumura et al. reported 3 cases of steroid induced coronary spasm [7]. This might be explained by the fact that, in a dose dependent manner, cortisol treatment decreases ATP-induced intracellular calcium mobilization, which in turn decreases nitrate, nitrite, and nitric oxide release [8]. Similarly, glucocorticoids downregulate cyclooxygenase-1 gene expression and subsequently suppress the production of the vasodilator prostacyclin; meanwhile they increase the synthesis of thromboxane which is a vasoconstrictor [9]. There is also evidence that elevated serum cortisol levels might sensitize the coronary vasoconstricting responses through Rho-kinase activation [10]. Additionally, it reduces endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA stability and inhibits the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, which is an important cofactor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase [11].Interestingly, Okumura hypothesized that corticosteroid-induced vasospastic angina might be underestimated due to being mistakenly confused with its known side effect of epigastric discomfort. Wei et al. reported that, among patients using high dose glucocorticoids (>7.5 mg/day), the relative risk for cardiovascular events occurrence was 2.56 [12].In 2007, Varas-Lorenzo et al. performed a cohort study with nested case-control analysis to estimate the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) associated with the use of oral corticosteroids by dose and duration. The study included 4795 hospitalized cases of AMI or CAD deaths and randomly sampled 20,000 controls and frequency matched by sex, age, and calendar year.The adjusted OR for AMI in current users of oral corticosteroids compared to nonusers was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.17–1.72). The risk during the first 30 days of use (OR = 2.24; 95% CI: 1.56–3.20) was greater than with longer duration (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 0.98–1.52). The risk was more pronounced (OR = 2.15; 95% CI 1.45–3.14) among users of prednisolone equivalent doses >10 mg/day. The study concluded that there is a small increased risk of AMI with oral corticosteroid use with a greater risk observed among users of high corticosteroid dose [13].In 2013, Coloma et al. identified 163 drugs reported to cause acute MI in various case reports, out of which 39 had a more probable association with MI including betamethasone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone (RR (95% confidence interval) 3.2 (2.9, 3.5), OR 1.9 (1.7, 2.2), and IRR 5.4 (4.1, 7.2)). Of note, 285 excess cases representing patients on dexamethasone who had an AMI however with other more plausible causes were identified [3]. All the previous mechanisms might explain a possible “spasm-thrombosis” sequence that occurred in our patient in the setting of her long standing other risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia as mentioned. Interestingly, two prior cases reported angiographically normal coronaries in androgen using athletes who ended up having a coronary occlusion [14]. We are including a comparison between six prior cases of AMI associated with steroid use shedding the light on their different clinical scenarios and other preexisting risk factors for coronary artery disease (Table 1).Different forms of steroids have been linked to CAD either through promoting its traditional risk factors or by other unidentified mechanisms. In most reported cases of steroid-associated AMI, the temporal relation was the main factor suggesting causality. We believe that, with the wide use of corticosteroids for a variety of indications, physicians should be aware of this possible association. Cautious use should be considered particularly in patients with other risk factors for CAD until there is a larger and more convincing pool of evidence.The authors have no conflict of interests to disclose.
Paediatric Nonfunctioning Adrenocortical Carcinoma with Extension up to Right-Side Heart: Cardiac Surgery Approach
Department of Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery and Cardiology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Ospedali Riuniti Ancona “Umberto I, G. M. Lancisi, G. Salesi” Ancona, Via Conca 71, 60128 Ancona,  ItalyReceived 9 March 2016; Accepted 27 June 2016Academic Editor: Ramazan AkdemirCopyright © 2016 Federica Iezzi et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare malignancy. Due to late diagnosis and no adequate effective adjuvant treatment, prognosis remains poor. Only approximately 30% of these malignancies are confined to the adrenal gland when they are diagnosed, as these tumors tend to be found years after their genesis. Cardiac involvement of adrenal carcinoma is very rare. We report a rare case of a 7-year-old female with right adrenal cortical carcinoma, involving the right-side heart. Childhood adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare and highly malignant neoplasm, with propensity to involve adrenal vein, renal vein, and inferior vena cava, rarely reaching up to right atrium. Dissemination of the tumor occurs in 82% of the patients with a median survival of 14.5 months. Patients with nonfunctioning tumor usually have no symptoms [1].The management of choice for adrenal tumors with thrombotic extension into inferior vena cava is en bloc tumor removal. Accurate preoperative radiographic evaluation of primary tumor and determination of any venous tumor involvement are therefore absolutely critical to surgical approach and successful management.A 7-year-old child was referred to our department, as urgent case, from another hospital due to echocardiography evidence of a huge mass in inferior vena cava, reaching right heart, up to right ventricle outflow tract.The physical examination revealed a sistodiastolic murmur on the third intercostal space of left sternal border.Pulmonary and abdominal examination was unremarkable. She complained of occasional and aspecific abdominal pain.The laboratory findings included elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (507 U/L) and neuron-specific enolase (86 ng/mL).Transthoracic echocardiography showed a round, long, mobile, nonobstructing mass invading inferior vena cava wall, extending into right atrium, prolapsing through tricuspid valve, and reaching the outflow tract of right ventricle. The isoechogenic intracardiac mass (5,3 cm × 1 cm), stipple in texture structure with well-demarcated borders, was adherent to inferior vena cava wall, with its incomplete obstruction and consequent dilation of hepatic veins. There was no evidence of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. No other intracardiac masses were noted, and the tricuspid valve was uninvolved, with normal color-flow and spectral Doppler evaluation.Enhanced computed tomographic scanning revealed a 5 cm × 4,5 cm large mass in right suprarenal location with infiltration into right renal artery, superior mesenteric artery, right renal vein, distal tract of left renal vein, and inferior vena cava, reaching up to right atrium. Abdominal imaging revealed also a solitary 26 mm hepatic lesion in segment V (Figure 1).The exam pointed to a diagnosis of adrenal carcinoma with extension of tumor into right heart.Due to the risk of embolism from the tumor, continuous infusion of heparin was immediately initiated. After multidisciplinary meeting with paediatric cardiothoracic surgeons, paediatric cardiologists, oncologists, vascular surgeons, and general paediatric surgeons, due to the serious risk of fatal pulmonary embolization of the large atrioventricular mass, the patient underwent emergency cardiac surgery.Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted by cannulation of ascending aorta and by use of a single venous cannula in superior vena cava, direct through right atrium. Circulatory arrest at 22°C was employed together with cardioplegic arrest. The tumor was found to have a wide attachment into the inferior vena cava wall. Through a right atriotomy the excision of tumor mass with removal of intracaval and right heart extension was performed. The cardiac postoperative course was uneventful. Short-interval follow-up showed no tumor or thrombus protruding into right heart.Extemporaneous histopathology of the specimen revealed cellular pleomorphism with large nuclei, abundant cytoplasm, and numerous small vascular channels which were findings compatible with an endocrine tumor.Histopathological examination of the right atrial mass revealed malignant adrenal epithelial cells with nuclear pleomorphism, high mitotic activity (mitotic rate 35 per 50 high power fields), and confluent areas of necrosis. Barely visible fibrous bands separated the tumor mass into fine lobules. A small area of the tumor presented a broad-trabecular pattern and was predominantly composed of clear-cytoplasm cells. Overall, clear cells made up no more than 25% of the whole tumor area (Figure 2).The tumor cells showed strong diffused immunoreactivity for vimentin, synaptophysin, and inhibin. Melan A expression was diffusely positive. The tumor cells were calretinin, chromogranin, S100, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, and CAM 5.2 negative.In the present case transthoracic echocardiography identified the cardiac involvement of an adrenocortical carcinoma. Tumors that affect the right-side heart include primary neoplasms. For the high risk of right ventricle outflow tract obstruction and pulmonary embolism heart surgery approach was mandatory [2].Inferior vena caval invasion is well-known complication as well, more commonly seen with right-sided heart masses. The prognostic value of intravenous extension is still controversial and debated but does not represent a contraindication to surgery. Involvement of the inferior vena cava was reported in only single case reports and small series, in which complete surgical resection remains the most effective treatment [3].The appropriate treatment for adrenocortical carcinoma is not well established, and the effectiveness of other modalities, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, is not proven.Neoadjuvant therapy with systemic chemotherapy and mitotane adrenolytic strategy should be considered for patients with primarily incomplete resectable, inoperable, or disseminated adrenocortical carcinoma and tumor spillage.Mitotane and chemotherapy with etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin plus mitotane are the only therapies with demonstrated efficacy in advanced adrenocortical carcinoma. Prognostic and predictive factors are needed to identify patients who could obtain the best benefit from these treatments. Despite the strong rationale for their use, clinical trials on molecular targeted therapies have failed to demonstrate that these drugs are efficacious in the management of this extremely rare disease. Mitotane and cytotoxic chemotherapy are currently the only systemic treatments available for locally advanced or metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma not amenable to surgery.Currently our patient is following systemic chemotherapy plan, in preparation for oncological surgery.In light of these findings, surgery remains the best treatment modality for adrenocortical carcinoma in the early stages. However, data regarding the effectiveness of surgery in the management of metastatic tumor remain scarce [4].Improved survival is seen in patients who present at an early stage and have complete primary resection. Five-year survival for patients with stage IV tumors is usually less than 20%.Detection of local invasion or tumor extension into the inferior vena cava, as well as lymph node or other metastases (lung and liver), is important for planning surgery.In the case of inoperable local infiltrating or metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma, surgical excision of the primary tumor or metastasis should be considered in case of documented response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, when a radical resection seems to be feasible [5].Despite a comprehensive biochemical, radiologic, and histologic assessment of adrenocortical carcinoma, planning an operative procedure with a heart involvement remains a challenge.Due to the tendency of the tumor to disseminate, a precise preoperative assessment is essential.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Life Threatening Severe QTc Prolongation in Patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus due to Hydroxychloroquine
1New York Methodist Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, 506 6th Street, Brooklyn, NY 11215,  USA2New York Methodist Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, 506 6th Street, Brooklyn, NY 11215,  USAReceived 18 April 2016; Accepted 15 June 2016Academic Editor: Christian MachadoCopyright © 2016 John P. O’Laughlin et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We present a case of a syncopal episode resulting from significant QT interval prolongation in a patient on hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and end stage renal disease. The patient had been treated with hydroxychloroquine for two years prior to presentation. After thorough workup for secondary causes of QT interval prolongation hydroxychloroquine was discontinued and the patient’s QT interval shortened. The patient was treated with mexiletine to prevent sudden ventricular arrhythmias, which was unique compared to other documented cases in which lidocaine was used. The patient was noted to have mild prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiogram prior to initiation of hydroxychloroquine therapy which was exacerbated by its use and may have been caused due to toxicity from underlying renal failure.QT interval prolongation is the result of abnormal repolarization of the ventricular myocardium resulting in lengthening of the QT interval on electrocardiogram [1–3]. In females the normal corrected QT interval is 470 ms, with males slightly lower at 450 ms [4]. It can be the result of congenital genetic mutations in cardiac myocyte ion channels [5], acquired from electrolyte derangements (hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia), or from use of numerous medications. Common classes of medications include antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, and antipsychotics (Table 1) [6]. Clinical manifestations of prolonged QT interval include syncope and sudden cardiac death from a fatal cardiac arrhythmia known as Torsades de Pointes (TdP). TdP is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute with characteristic twisting around the isoelectric baseline every 5–20 beats [7, 8].Of the documented medications known to cause QT interval prolongation hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is extremely rare in the literature. HCQ is an antimalarial that has become the cornerstone for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [9]. HCQ has a long half-life ranging from 32 to 50 days with a modest side effect profile with most common reactions associated with the gastrointestinal system [10] and ocular toxicity [11]. The drug is commonly utilized in treatment of SLE for patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD); however the exact dosing and toxicity are not well established and need further study [12]. The common cardiac toxicities of HCQ are not well defined. Chen et al. 2006 reported QT interval prolongation with associated TdP in a patient on chronic HCQ treatment [13], and Morgan et al. 2013 described QT interval prolongation in a patient with SLE while taking HCQ [14]. We present a unique case of severe QT interval prolongation in a patient with SLE and ESRD on chronic HCQ therapy which lead to a life threatening complication of syncope and resultant head trauma.A 50-year-old female with a past medical history of SLE diagnosed 20 years ago, ESRD on hemodialysis and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. The patient was sitting on the side of her bed when she suddenly lost consciousness falling to the floor striking the right side of her face. She sustained significant facial trauma; however there were no signs of intracranial hemorrhage on CT scan of the brain. She described palpitations with chest pressure prior to the event. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) reported by emergency medical services did not reveal any acute arrhythmias, such as TdP. Due to the complaints of chest pressure she was evaluated for cardiac ischemia utilizing cardiac biomarkers, CKMB and Troponin I. A total of three sets were completed every eight hours apart; all studies were reported within normal limits ruling out cardiac ischemia. Troponin I values were less than 0.045 ng/mL and CKMB values were all less than 0.5 ng/mL. ECG on presentation revealed 1st-degree AV block with corrected QT (QTc) interval of 689 ms (Figure 1). Patient’s ECG from two years prior showed a baseline prolonged QTc interval of 500 (Figure 2). She was evaluated for reversible causes of QT interval prolongation including electrolyte derangements, medications, and SLE flare. Her electrolytes were within normal limits including potassium (3.9 mmol/L), magnesium (2.3 mg/dL), phosphorous (4.2 mg/dL), and calcium (9.0 mg/dL). C3 levels were low, with normal C4 and ESR, and anti-dsDNA was negative making SLE flare unlikely. Patient continued to have dialysis on her normally scheduled days.After evaluation by electrophysiology there was concern for presumed TdP due to her clinical presentation and grossly abnormal QTc interval. She was placed on mexiletine 150 mg BID and was initially recommended to have defibrillator implantation to protect against sudden cardiac death from cardiac arrhythmias. Evaluation of the patient’s medications revealed that she was taking HCQ for the past two years for treatment of refractory SLE. HCQ was discontinued and the patient’s QT interval slowly decreased to a QTc interval of 500 over the next 7 days (Figure 3). She was monitored on the telemetry unit for one week and did not have any further arrhythmic events. After further discussion with the patient’s Cardiologist and Rheumatologist she had been noted to have a prolonged QTc interval of approximately 500 ms while on therapy with HCQ. She was trialed off the medication for two months without resolution of the QT interval abnormality, possibly due to undiagnosed underlying SLE cardiomyopathy. The patient’s ejection fraction on echocardiography one year prior was estimated at 65% with Doppler parameters consistent with abnormal relaxation suggesting heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Implantable defibrillator placement was discussed with the patient prior to admission due to the prolonged baseline QTc interval. However, she was reluctant to proceed as she did not want indwelling devices due to concern for possible Permacath placement in the future for dialysis if her arteriovenous fistula malfunctioned.The risks and benefits of continuing HCQ were discussed with the patient, and she decided she wanted to continue the medication due to well controlled SLE flares. She had noted adverse reactions to steroid therapy and limited treatment options for SLE due to her underlying renal failure. We discussed the risks of recurrent syncopal episodes if she was to continue HCQ therapy, and the high risk for intracranial bleed while on anticoagulation if she was to have another syncopal episode. Final recommendations were made to proceed with defibrillator placement if she was to continue with HCQ to protect against life threatening arrhythmias. She had a subcutaneous defibrillator placement and was to be restarted on HCQ as an outpatient with dose reduction and close monitoring of QTc interval.At three-month follow-up the patient remained off HCQ as after discussion with her Rheumatologist the risks related to syncope and possible intracranial bleed while on anticoagulation treatment greatly outweighed the benefits of HCQ therapy. She continues to be closely monitored for SLE flares, and treatment decisions are to be strategized as clinical issues arise. Subcutaneous implantable defibrillator interrogation showed no recorded events at three months. Her ECG continues to show a prolonged QTc interval of 508 ms. Due to the prolonged QTc interval she is still at high risk of ventricular arrhythmias despite discontinuation of HCQ. Therefore, the subcutaneous implantable defibrillator is providing secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death due to prolonged QT interval.QT interval prolongation is of consequential clinical importance as patients are at high risk of traumatic injury from syncopal events or sudden cardiac death from life threatening arrhythmias such as TdP [6, 7]. Without early identification of possible reversible causes of QT interval prolongation patients may have fatal outcomes. The identifiable causes relating to electrolyte derangements, medications, or cardiac ischemia must be quickly rectified. If patients continue to have QT interval prolongation despite optimal medical management patients may need immediate protection from arrhythmias with the use of antiarrhythmic medications such as lidocaine or mexiletine and long term protection with an external or implantable defibrillator.The decrease in QT interval observed in this patient is likely multifactorial due to discontinuation of the offending agent HCQ and the use of mexiletine. Mexiletine is a class IB antiarrhythmic that acts by blocking sodium channels shortening the plateau phase of the myocardial action potential thereby hastening repolarization rates with resultant shortening of QT interval duration [15].Of the known medications to cause QT interval prolongation, HCQ is not commonly implicated. With HCQ as a first-line therapy for treatment of SLE, it is important that QT interval be frequently monitored in patients on chronic therapy. HCQ has a significantly long half-life, 32–50 days; however metabolism of the drug is not well understood [10, 11]. Treatment recommendations for SLE include HCQ 400 mg orally once or twice daily with therapy ranging from weeks to months [16]. If prolonged therapy is needed doses should range from 200 to 400 mg daily [16]. The use of HCQ in patients with renal disease is not well documented, and thus patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored while on the drug.The proposed mechanism by which HCQ causes QT interval prolongation is not well understood. Recently demonstrated in guinea pig sinoatrial node myocytes by Capel et al. 2015, they observed findings consistent with inhibitory effects of HCQ on the hyperpolarization activated current ion channels (also known as “funny current” channels, ), along with delayed rectifier potassium currents (), and L-type calcium ion currents () [17]. These inhibitory effects on the pacemaker cells were shown to cause delayed rates in depolarization leading to decreased heart rates in the cell line studied [17]. These findings may correlate with a proposed mechanism by which refractory action potentials in cardiac myocytes may lead to prolongation of QT interval due to delayed depolarization and repolarization from abnormal ion currents.This case is a unique presentation of a patient on HCQ therapy for approximately 2 years, with maintenance dosing at 200 mg oral daily. Due to the renal impairment, medication toxicity may have resulted in the severe QT interval prolongation with resultant cardiac arrhythmia and subsequent syncopal event. A recent retrospective review of patients (,537) on HCQ therapy found no significant correlation between HCQ use and QT interval prolongation [18]. Reported cases of QT interval prolongation with HCQ use are likely related to toxic blood levels due to overdose or abnormal metabolism in patients with liver or renal dysfunction. Therefore, patients with renal and hepatic impairment should consider alternative treatment modalities as they are at highest risk for QT interval prolongation and subsequent arrhythmias. Further investigation into the mechanism of action of HCQ, its metabolism, and other possible cardiac toxicities needs to be further elucidated.HCQ has proven to be successful in the treatment of SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria [19, 20]. The therapeutic benefits are well established; however treatment in specific populations needs to be further investigated to establish more specific recommendations on dosages and contraindicated populations to prevent possible fatal events. With the documented cases of HCQ use and related QT interval prolongation, all patients irrespective of underlying comorbidities should be frequently monitored with electrocardiograms.The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Diagnosis Using CCTA and Management of Anomalous Right Coronary Artery from the Opposite Sinus
Memorial Hospital of Tampa, Tampa General Hospital, University of South Florida, Cardiology Clinic, 602 Audubon, Suite B, Tampa, FL 33609,  USAReceived 7 January 2016; Accepted 14 June 2016Academic Editor: Expedito E. RibeiroCopyright © 2016 Asma Mursleen et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Coronary anomalies can be observed in 1–1.2% of all angiograms performed. Majority of coronary anomalies are benign and do not lead to cardiac ischemia; however anomalous coronary arteries from the opposite sinus (ACAOS) are often associated with sudden cardiac deaths, typically in 0.11–0.35% of individuals who participate in vigorous physical activity (Peñalver et al., 2012). Left and right ACAOS have an incidence of 0.15% and 0.92%, respectively. Left ACAOS are often associated with higher incidence of sudden cardiac death; this could be secondary to greater territory of myocardial perfusion by the left coronary artery. ACAOS are often asymptomatic and initially present as sudden death following exertion in young athletes. The management of left ACAOS is clear and surgery is usually indicated. However there is a lack of consensus on the management of certain cases of right ACAOS. In this paper a case of 20 yo M with right coronary artery from left sinus is going to be presented with a discussion on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management. A 20-year-old Caucasian male presented to the cardiac clinic for evaluation of chest pain and elevated blood pressure. His chest pains were sharp, occurred randomly, and were mostly nonexertional. He also had an abnormal EKG demonstrating nonspecific ST/T wave changes (see Figure 1). His past medical history was unremarkable. He is a smoker and drinks alcohol socially and denied illicit drug usage. An echocardiogram performed in the office was normal, with the coronary arteries arising from the appropriate cups.A cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was performed revealing anomalous origin of the right artery from the left coronary cusp. The proximal portion had an acute-angle take-off with an intramural course with a 70–80% stenosis. The vessel also coursed between the aorta and pulmonary arteries (see Figure 1).Anomalous coronary arteries from the opposite sinus (ACAOS) are usually asymptomatic; however they can initially present as syncope or even sudden cardiac death in up to 0.35% of the cases [1]. It is important to include ACAOS in the differential diagnosis of a young patient complaining of any cardiopulmonary symptoms as early diagnoses and management of ACAOS can likely prevent sudden cardiac death. Management of left ACAOS is clear and surgery is usually recommended. Right ACAOS with clear evidence of cardiac ischemia can also lead to sudden death and surgery is suggested. In this case the patient had a right ACAOS with atypical symptoms; the management of which is controversial.Right ACAOS can be further classified into interarterial, subpulmonic, and retroaortic course. Interarterial ACAOS originates above the pulmonary valve and courses between the aorta and pulmonary arteries and is associated with a higher prevalence of chest pain and cardiac events [2]. Exertion can lead to engorgement of vessels and possible mechanical compression of the anomalous coronary artery leading to decreased perfusion and increased risk of sudden death [2]. An acute-angle take-off is associated with kinking of the coronary artery at its origin, affecting blood flow as well.An intramural course is associated with possibly the highest risk of adverse cardiac events. The proximal intramural segment intussuscepts into the aortic wall leading to coronary artery hypoplasia of the involved segment within the aortic wall. Systolic compression of the aortic wall laterally compresses the intramural stenotic coronary segment [3]. The hypoplastic intramural coronary segment is usually ovoid and lateral compression of an ovoid artery leads to a smaller area in comparison to the same lateral compression of a circular artery of the same circumference [3].CCTA is a superior noninvasive imaging technique that can be used to diagnose and exclude coronary anomalies with high accuracy. In addition, it can provide precise information such as vessel course and orifice location [4]. CCTA images in Figures 1 and 2 are illustrating the course and anatomy of the right coronary artery in this patient. Figure 3 is a 3D reconstruction of an internal view of the orifice of the right coronary artery highlighting the slit-like opening and intramural course of the right coronary in comparison to the circular orifice of the left coronary. Figures 4 and 5 are 3D reconstructions of the coronary arteries from various angles again depicting the course of the vessels and demonstrating the accuracy and details that can be obtained from CCTA images.After the diagnosis is made, the next diagnostic approach is to evaluate for ischemia with a perfusion stress imaging such as either with a cardiac perfusion nuclear or MRI stress imaging. Nuclear stress testing is readily available in most centers; however, a cardiac MRI is a preferable first-choice modality if available as it is radiation-free and can assess for ischemic related subendocardial fibrosis, which is often missed by nuclear imaging.One of the largest studies on ACAOS was conducted by American Armed Forces Institute of Pathology where 6.3 million 18-year-old recruits who underwent intense military training for 8 weeks were looked at for unrelated trauma deaths. There were 64 cardiac deaths and 21 (33%) were related to L-ACAOS. There was not any other coronary anomalies which lead to death (including R-ACAOS). This study showed that although the left anomalous coronaries are dangerous, the right coronary artery anomalies might not pose as big a risk of sudden death.The conservative management options for ACAOS include observation, beta blocker medications, and avoiding strenuous activity. Invasive procedure for the treatment of ARCAOS includes stenting, CABG, unroofing, and reimplantation surgery. Stenting is associated with high risk of restenosis likely due to the phasic compression of the stent during normal cardiac cycle. CABG does not require opening the aortic root; however it is associated with poor long-term patency and presence of anterograde competitive flow. Unroofing surgery relieves systolic compression of proximal anomalous coronary artery and reimplantation creates neoostial orifice at the correct coronary sinus. There is still risk of stenosis of neoostial orifice and aortic valve injury. According to ACC/AHA 2008 recommendation for congenital coronary anomalies of ectopic arterial origin, the main indications for surgery in ACAOS include documentation of myocardial ischemia, vascular wall hypoplasia, and/or obstruction to coronary flow.Many cases in literature describe right ACAOS in the setting where the patient experiences a major cardiac event or has clear coronary ischemic symptoms. The management course in these cases and in cases where myocardial ischemia is documented is clear-cut. However, in patients with vague nonlimiting symptoms, which could be cardiac in nature, and no clear evidence of myocardial ischemia, further investigation may be warranted.Our patient underwent a submaximal dobutamine cardiac MRI stress test with gadolinium, which was negative for ischemia and infarction. Given that the maximum heart rate was not reached, the MRI stress test interpretations are limited. A year later, a Bruce protocol treadmill stress echocardiogram was performed and was also negative for myocardial ischemia. The patient in this case does not participate in competitive sports and opted for conservative management. The patient was advised to stop smoking and avoid strenuous exercise and placed on beta blockers for his hypertension. He will be followed up yearly for stress testing.The authors report no competing interests.The final paper has been seen and approved by all authors.
Arteria Lusoria: An Anomalous Finding during Right Transradial Coronary Intervention

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Arteria Lusoria or aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) is present in 0.6–1.4% of individuals. It typically remains clinically silent and is often discovered during angiographic procedures. The presence of ARSA can make a right transradial approach for coronary angiography and angioplasty technically more difficult. With the use of catheter support, we describe two cases in which a right transradial approach for catheterization was successful in the setting of ARSA. As such, the presence of ARSA does not warrant abandoning a transradial approach for coronary angiography and angioplasty.Arteria Lusoria or aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) is the most common congenital arch anomaly in which the right subclavian artery originates from the descending aorta, distal to the left subclavian at the ductus arteriosus [1]. On its course towards the right arm, the aberrant vessel travels retrotracheal and retroesophageal [1]. The prevalence of ARSA ranges from 0.6 to 1.4% [1]. The prevalence of ARSA rises exponentially to 26–34% in individuals with Down syndrome and other chromosomal defects [1].ARSA remains clinically silent in the majority of cases. In approximately 5% of individuals, ARSA is associated with an aberrant umbilical vein, tricuspid atresia, or tetralogy of Fallot [1]. Rarely, ARSA can accompany Kommerell’s diverticulum, an aneurysm of the descending aorta at the origin of the ARSA [2]. This can present clinically as dysphagia, dyspnea, or subclavian steal syndrome, often requiring surgical intervention [2].Despite reports of complications on right radial approach for angiography, we report two cases demonstrating the success and safety of this approach.A 42-year-old man with a past history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, presented to hospital with acute onset of retrosternal chest discomfort. He had an elevation of his cardiac biomarkers and was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). During coronary angiography, right radial access with a 6 Fr. Side arm sheath was obtained. The advancement of any catheters into the ascending aorta from the radial approach was very difficult due to tortuous angulation at the junction between the ascending aorta and the right innominate artery. With the help of a 0.035′′ Glidewire (Terumo Interventional Systems, Somerset, NJ), a pigtail was advanced into the ascending aorta and an aortic root angiography was performed. This confirmed the presence of ARSA (Figure 1). For catheter exchanges, a 260 cm 0.038′′ J curved wire (Cordis, Hialeah, FL) was used. A JL3.5 diagnostic catheter (Cordis, Hialeah, FL) was used for left coronary angiography and a JR4.0 diagnostic catheter (Cordis, Hialeah, FL) was used for right coronary angiography. For the PCI procedure, a 6 Fr. XB 3.5 guiding catheter (Cordis, Hialeah, FL) was used to allow adequate support during the LAD intervention.A 51-year-old woman presented for angiography following a NSTEMI. A right radial approach with a 6 Fr. Sheath was selected. Multiple guidewires consistently engaged the descending aorta. A Judkins right 4.0 catheter (Cordis, Hialeah, FL) was placed at the right subclavian artery ostium. With gentle clockwise motion and simultaneous advancement of the 0.038′′ guidewire, the ascending aorta was successfully engaged (Figure 2). As with Case  1, catheter exchanges were done with a 260 cm 0.038′′ J curved wire (Cordis, Hialeah, FL). Angioplasty was performed using a 6 Fr. XB 4.0 guiding catheter (Cordis, Hialeah, FL). A subsequent computed tomography of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of ARSA.In the vast majority of patients, as in the two cases illustrated, ARSA is clinically silent until right radial coronary angiography is entertained. With the increasing use of a transradial approach for coronary angiography as a result of the lower risk of access site related complications, ARSA will be encountered more frequently [3]. ARSA can be confirmed by aortography and should be suspected when catheterization of the ascending aorta proves difficult and the catheter favors entry into the descending aorta. Due to the increased anatomical complexity, ARSA may increase number of catheters used and prolong angiography time, especially if previously unrecognized [3].Previous studies have described low procedural success rates of 6/10 during catheterization in the setting of ARSA, due to increased technical demand [4]. We have demonstrated with the two current cases that catheter support and rotation can facilitate successful, nontraumatic entry into the ascending aorta [3]. In addition, a transradial approach in the setting of ARSA appears safe, with no significant difference in dissection rate between anatomically normal and variant subclavian arteries [4]. As in all cases in which complex percutaneous coronary intervention is required, specific attention should be placed on appropriate guide support. In the absence of this, consideration towards gaining access from another approach would be warranted.While right radial angiography and angioplasty are technically more demanding in the setting of ARSA, it does not necessitate abandoning the right radial approach [5].The authors have conformed to institutional ethical guidelines.Consent was obtained from patients included in the case report.The authors report no financial relationships or conflict of interests regarding the content herein.
Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Coexisting with Acute Pericarditis and Myocardial Bridge
1Department of Cardiology, Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 14456 13131,  Iran2Department of Cardiology, Qom University of Medical Sciences, Qom,  Iran3Department of Internal Medicine, Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran,  IranReceived 24 January 2016; Revised 28 April 2016; Accepted 12 June 2016Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2016 Seyed Hashem Sezavar et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a stress-induced cardiomyopathy that occurs primarily in postmenopausal women. It mimics clinical picture of acute coronary syndrome with nonobstructive coronary arteries and a characteristic transient left (or bi-) ventricular apical ballooning at angiography. The exact pathogenesis of TCM is not well recognized. Hereby we present an unusual case of TCM that presents with signs and symptoms of acute pericarditis and was also found to have a coexisting coronary muscle bridge on coronary angiography. We discuss the impact of these associations in better understanding of the pathogenesis of TCM. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) or transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome is a novel type of cardiomyopathy that was first described in 1990 as a differential diagnosis for acute coronary syndrome in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease [1]. It predominantly affects postmenopausal women and is often preceded by a physical or emotional stress [2, 3]. Although the exact pathogenesis of TCM is not well recognized, the role of excessive catecholamine release has been proposed to act via some possible mechanisms such as coronary artery vasospasm (close to mechanism of Prinzmetal’s angina [4]) and/or regional myocardial dysfunction with contraction band necrosis (similar to mechanism of electrocardiographic changes after subarachnoid hemorrhage [5]).Hereby we present an unusual case of TCM that presents with signs and symptoms of acute pericarditis and was found to have a coexisting coronary muscle bridge on coronary angiography (CAG), associations that might have an impact on better understanding of the pathogenesis of TCM.A 42-year-old Iranian woman was brought to the emergency department with a sharp, persistent pleuritic chest pain beginning after an emotional stress. She had neither remarkable past medical history for coronary risk factors nor any relevant past interventions. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and normal S1 and S2 with S3 gallop as well as a triphasic friction rub (one systolic and two diastolic sounds) at cardiac auscultation. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated 1-2 mm ST elevation in leads I, II, III, aVF, and V4–V6, as well as ST depression and PR elevation at aVR (Figure 1). A transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) on admission showed an apical akinesia with a preserved basal function, a mild pericardial effusion, an ejection fraction of 40%, and a moderate mitral regurgitation (Figure 2).After finding wall motion abnormality on TTE and because of persistent chest pain, despite the initial clinical diagnosis of acute pericarditis, the patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheter laboratory in order to look for any coronary artery disease requiring intervention. CAG demonstrated a severe muscle bridge at mid portion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and otherwise normal coronary arteries (Figure 3); left ventriculography showed characteristic systolic ballooning of the apex in favor of TCM (Figure 3). Result of the laboratory tests revealed mildly elevated serum levels of cardiac enzymes: creatine kinase MB = 30 ng/mL (normal range < 25 ng/mL) and troponin I = 0.89 ng/mL (normal range < 0.01).The patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril 6.25 mg three times per day), a diuretic (furosemide 20 mg three times per day), and a beta-blocker (carvedilol 3.125 two times per day). She also received aspirin for 4 days at high enough doses for treating pericarditis (650 mg three times per day). On serial ECG mild T-wave inversion was found in leads I, II, III, aVL, aVF, and V4–V6 at 2nd day of admission which then became deeper at 3rd day (Figures 4 and 5).The patient’s general condition considerably improved over the next few days and her chest pain was completely resolved. One week later, a subsequent TTE at discharge day revealed an improved left ventricular ejection fraction of 50–55% with no apical ballooning, no significant mitral regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion.In the present case, the fairly sudden onset of a sharp and pleuritic chest pain, the characteristic three-phasic pericardial friction rub, the mild pericardial effusion on TTE, and the significant clinical response to high-dose aspirin all are in favor of acute pericarditis. On the other hand, such features as the clear history of an emotional stress before the onset of chest pain, diffuse ST elevation on ECG with the patent coronary arteries at CAG, and the characteristic apical ballooning at TTE with spontaneous recovery are suggesting features of TCM. Finally, detection of coronary muscle bridge at CAG adds a third diagnostic issue to this patient’s presentation.After the first formal description of TCM in 1990 in Japan [1], several patients have been reported with this diagnosis worldwide. Although it has been described to predominantly affect postmenopausal women with a clinical presentation similar to acute coronary syndrome [3], cases of TCM at a different age group [6–8] (even at childhood [9]) or with unusual presentations [10–12] have also been reported. Our patient, a woman at premenopausal age which is not typical for TCM, presented with the clinical picture of acute pericarditis. Association of TCM with pericarditis has been reported in at least 8 reports among which at 3 cases pericarditis presented as a complication of TCM [13–15] and at the other 5 ones pericarditis preceded the presentation of TCM [9, 16–19]. In the former cases, regional inflammatory myocarditis, which has been previously reported both at endomyocardial biopsy specimens [20] and at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of TCM patients [21], has been hypothesized to be extended to the overlying pericardium and then is clinically presented as pericarditis [22]. The role of intense catecholamine release as a result of severe pericarditis-induced chest pain, however, has been supposed to describe pericarditis as a trigger for TCM in the latter cases [22]. In our case, the scenario began with an emotional stress which led to an initial clinical picture of acute pericarditis and then was established as TCM. History of a preceding major stress, similar to our patient, was described in only one out of those 5 cases that presented with pericarditis and then developed TCM. With focusing on this unique presentation, TCM presents as acute pericarditis without the history of recent febrile illness but instead with the history of a major stressful event, an intermediary mechanism for combined pericarditis, and TCM in this case would be considering the whole scenario as a variant of “perimyocarditis” [23]. It means that, considering the inflammatory hypothesis for TCM, a clinicopathophysiological spectrum of TCM patients could be hypothesized: those TCM cases with the inflammation mostly limited to myocytes with minimal or no pericardial involvement are at one end of the spectrum, and those in which the pericardial component of the inflammation is more dominant are at the other end. Sequential ECG might help differentiate the latter cases from those with simple pericarditis: a rapid development of T-wave inversion after the phase of ST-segment elevation (as in our case) is in favor of TCM [24]. However, patients with pure pericarditis have slower progression of T-wave inversion.According to the proposed diagnostic criteria of Mayo Clinic, absence of myocarditis is needed to confirm the diagnosis of TCM [25]. Moreover, using cardiac MRI, Eitel et al. [26] demonstrated that 8 out of 59 patients (13.6%) with apical ballooning at CAG had a final diagnosis of myocarditis. Considering these points and the fact that we did not perform cardiac MRI for the patient, one might be concerned about a neglected diagnosis of myocarditis rather than “real” TCM. However, the rather acute onset of chest pain with a prominent pleuritic pattern, the disproportionate elevation of cardiac enzymes (to the extensive ECG changes), and the rapid resolution of the disease all make it less likely to consider myocarditis as the final diagnosis of this patient.Another interesting point in this case was coexistence of myocardial bridge, a congenital coronary anomaly characterized by systolic compression of a part of an epicardial vessel by a segment of overlying myocardium, and TCM. Association of myocardial bridge and TCM has been reported in some case reports and case series [27–30], which suggest that myocardial bridging of the LAD is a frequent finding in patients with apical ballooning syndrome. Actually, the high circulating level of catecholamines has been considered to uncover myocardial bridging in some patients with an apical ballooning syndrome and to make it angiographically evident [30]. However, myocardial bridge could also be a simple anatomical variant and is not necessarily associated with TCM. In such patients, by repeating CAG after a certain period of time, it can be ascertained if the myocardial bridging is still present (and is simply a coincidental finding) or not.In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of coexistence of myocardial bridging, TCM, and acute pericarditis in a single patient, which may suggest a potential role of both myocardial bridging and acute pericarditis in the pathogenesis of TCM.Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.The authors wish to thank Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital Clinical Research Development Center for technically supporting the project.
Recurrent Pericarditis, an Unexpected Effect of Adjuvant Interferon Chemotherapy for Malignant Melanoma
1Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Pawtucket, RI 02860,  USA2Kent Hospital, Warwick, RI 02886,  USAReceived 25 March 2016; Revised 7 June 2016; Accepted 9 June 2016Academic Editor: Gianluca Di BellaCopyright © 2016 Farhan Ashraf et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Drug-induced pericarditis is a well-described cardiac pathology that can result from a variety of medications; however, interferon-mediated pericarditis is extremely rare. We present a case of a young female with recurrent pericarditis due to interferon therapy. The role of interferon in adjuvant chemotherapy is well known and yields good effect, but this case highlights the very uncommon phenomena of interferon induced pericarditis and the significant distress it can cause.Pericarditis is a common disease with many known causes. One such etiology is drug-induced pericarditis, which is a well-described but relatively uncommon cardiac pathology that can result from a variety of medications. Classically implicated drugs include isoniazid, hydralazine, procainamide, dantrolene, doxorubicin, and penicillin. Pericarditis due to interferon therapy, however, is extremely rare. We present a case of recurrent pericarditis due to interferon alpha therapy.The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a past medical history of malignant melanoma of the right shoulder (T2N1) with status of postsurgical excision who originally presented to the Emergency Room with a 1-day history of chest pain after receiving her first dose of adjuvant chemotherapy (20 million units/m2 intravenous) with interferon alpha. The pain was described as sharp, pleuritic, substernal, and nonradiating. It was exacerbated by lying flat and relieved by leaning forward. Her only associated symptom was shortness of breath. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. Her vital signs were temperature: 97.6 degree Fahrenheit, blood pressure: 104/58 mmHg, heart rate: 80/minute, respiratory rate: 18/minute, and oxygen saturation: 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed regular cardiac rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs/rubs/gallops, and no signs of heart failure. Initial evaluation was remarkable for a white count of /μL, of which 62% were neutrophils, 23% were lymphocytes, and 14% were monocytes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm with an incomplete right bundle branch block without any PR, ST segment, or T-wave abnormalities. No troponin was checked, and she was discharged with a presumptive diagnosis of pericarditis.The day after discharge, the patient noted ongoing chest pain, so troponin was checked before her next chemotherapy session and was found to be elevated at 0.323 ng/mL, prompting admission. Her physical exam was unchanged from her initial presentation. EKG demonstrated no significant changes from before. An echocardiogram showed normal systolic and diastolic function with a small pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology (Figure 1). Her troponins downtrended and her telemetry monitoring was unrevealing. She was treated for myopericarditis with colchicine 0.5 mg oral twice a day and ibuprofen 800 mg oral three times a day with which her symptoms improved. She was discharged on two weeks of ibuprofen and three months of colchicine on the above mentioned dose.Given the suspicion that her myopericarditis was interferon induced, an extensive outpatient discussion involving the patient, her family, her oncologist, and a cardiooncologist took place. Ultimately, given the potential benefits in terms of survival that are conferred by interferon, the decision was made to attempt a rechallenge with the drug.Two months later she remained chest pain-free, and she resumed the interferon at half the initial dose (10 million units/m2). Within ten hours of the reinitiation of interferon therapy, she developed chest pain identical to her previous pain, which was pleuritic and was relieved by leaning forward. Physical examination was again unremarkable with no evidence of a pericardial friction rub or decompensated heart failure. Her EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without PR or ST segment or T-wave abnormalities. Her troponins during this admission were negative. Echocardiogram again showed normal systolic and diastolic function with trace pericardial effusion. She was again treated with ibuprofen 800 oral three times a day and colchicine 0.6 mg oral twice a day, with which her symptoms resolved. She was discharged on ibuprofen for two weeks and colchicine for another three months.Acute pericarditis is a disease of the fibroelastic sac surrounding the heart. It is the most common disease involving the pericardium. The most common cause for pericarditis is idiopathic, often presumed to be viral or immune-mediated [1]. Drug-induced pericarditis is well-described but is relatively uncommon. Acute pericarditis is diagnosed on the basis of typical pleuritic pain, a pericardial friction rub, suggestive electrocardiogram changes which are typically diffuse ST segment elevations, and a pericardial effusion [1, 2]. The presence of two of the above is considered sufficient to make the diagnosis of pericarditis. Routine testing for viral etiologies is not useful, as the yield for such testing is low, and it usually does not alter management [3].Interferon is a drug used in many clinical situations, the most common being treatment of hepatitis B and hepatitis C, lymphomas, and melanomas. Its most common side effects include flu-like illness, chest pain, alopecia, rash, pancytopenia, myalgias, and hepatotoxicity. Interferon-mediated pericarditis is extremely rare. Among the different interferons, interferon alpha is known to be the most cardiotoxic. It induces an autoimmune reaction through various mechanisms including production of gamma-globulins and interleukin-6 [4] and inhibition of Allo-specific suppressor T lymphocytes, as well as activation of natural killer cells [5].Our case demonstrates recurrent, non-dose-dependent acute pericarditis secondary to interferon with a relatively short duration of time to the development of pericarditis. No other typical inciting factors were noted, and withdrawal of the drug resulted in resolution of symptoms. The fact that she developed symptoms so soon after resumption of therapy at reduced dose further strengthens the association between interferon therapy and pericarditis. There are no known predisposing factors that lead to interferon-mediated cardiotoxicity, nor is it thought to be dose-dependent [6]. Based on the limited literature on the subject, the most common cardiovascular side effects of interferon therapy were arrhythmias, ischemic events, and heart failure [7–9]. Previous case reports have documented both pericarditis [10–12] and recurrent pericarditis [13, 14] in the setting of interferon administration, and our case adds to that literature. In cases, pericarditis even leads to development of tamponade fairly quickly [15]. Optimal therapy of interferon-mediated pericarditis is not well-defined, but stopping interferon and treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine results in good recovery.Our case highlights the importance of suspecting pericarditis in individuals who are receiving interferon therapy when they develop chest pain. It also shows a non-dose-dependent relationship between interferon therapy and pericarditis.There is not enough information available at this time with regard to interferon induced pericarditis. Based on the limited case repots available, it is difficult to estimate true incidence and ideal treatment of this phenomenon. The mechanism for this pathology is also not defined, making it very hard to predict which individuals are more likely to suffer from pericarditis, apart from those who already had an episode of interferon induced pericarditis.The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Left Main Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in a Young Male with Rheumatic Heart Disease and Porcelain Aorta
1Department of Internal Medicine, Aventura Hospital and Medical Center, 20900 Biscayne Boulevard, Aventura, FL 33180,  USA2Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Permian Basin Campus, 701 W. 5th Street, Odessa, TX 79763,  USA3University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue No. 1140, Miami, FL 33136,  USAReceived 7 April 2016; Accepted 9 June 2016Academic Editor: Nurten SayarCopyright © 2016 Vinod Chainani et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We highlight the presence of a calcified mass in the left main coronary artery without significant atherosclerosis seen in the other coronary arteries or in the peripheral large arteries. In our view, the calcified character of the obstruction and the calcification of the aortic valve are characteristic of a variant type of coronary artery disease (CAD) not associated with the same risk factors as diffuse coronary atherosclerosis, but, in this case, with rheumatic heart disease. This case report also emphasizes the interventional approach for patients with aortic valve stenosis secondary to rheumatic heart disease.Far from eradicated, after more than two hundred years since William Charles Wells linked acute rheumatic fever with carditis, rheumatic heart disease continues to be a disease of global proportions. In a recent extensive literature review by Carapetis and colleagues, it was estimated that there are over 15.6 million people affected by rheumatic heart disease globally with a reported 233,000 deaths annually [1]. Here we present the case of a young male with a variant type of coronary artery disease not associated with the typical risk factors for heart disease but with a prior history of rheumatic fever.A 57-year-old Caucasian male with history of rheumatic fever as a child, hypertension, and heavy alcohol use with associated cardiomyopathy presented with dyspnea on exertion for one year, worsening over the past two weeks. He had progressed from New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) Class II symptoms at baseline, including mild symptoms of shortness of breath during ordinary activities, to NYHA Class III, with marked limitation of activities during minimal exertion and was able only to feel comfortable at rest. He reported to have been previously evaluated at a different institution for similar but less severe symptoms three months prior to admission where he had an echocardiogram, the results of which are unknown. A cardiac catheterization was recommended but the patient left prior to the completion of this test.Vital signs were within normal limits. A physical exam revealed the murmur of aortic stenosis. Echocardiogram showed a mean aortic valve (AV) gradient of 20 mmHg, an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, and a calculated AV area of 0.61 cm2. A dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE) revealed a mean AV gradient of 39 mmHg at dobutamine 20 mcg/kg/min (43 mmHg at 15 mcg/kg/min), with a peak AV velocity of 435 cm/s, AV area of 0.55 cm2, and an EF of 37% (Figure 1). Coronary angiography revealed a calcified mass in the ostial left main coronary artery obstructing 80% of the vessel lumen. The chest computerized tomography (CT) showed a porcelain aorta without evidence of aneurysmal dilatation (Figure 2). No peripheral artery disease was visualized on CT or femoral angiography.Due to the presence of porcelain aorta, a combination of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and traditional surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) was not feasible. Alternatively, a left main percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with Impella support. Patient was stabilized, medically optimized, and discharged home in stable condition to follow-up in two weeks for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). Insurance issues complicated follow-up but, eventually, patient was successfully scheduled for TAVR four weeks after left heart catheterization and medical optimization as described above.At the time of TAVR, initially the access was predilated and an E-sheath was advanced into the ascending aorta. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed under rapid pacing at 180 beats per minute. The balloon was then exchanged for 26 mm Edwards XT. After positioning the bioprosthesis in the annulus of the native valve and under rapid pacing, the valve was deployed. The valve migrated towards the ventricle resulting in significant aortic regurgitation. Therefore, the decision was made to place a second valve, this time approximately 3 mm above the previous valve. A final aortogram showed evidence of trace aortic insufficiency; this finding was confirmed by echocardiography. A pigtail was advanced across the bioprosthesis into the left ventricle and measured no gradient across the aortic valve. Finally, the E-sheath was removed and the perclose sutures were tightened. Final digital subtraction angiogram showed no evidence of contrast extravasation.This case highlights the presence of a calcified mass in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) without significant atherosclerosis seen in the other coronary arteries or in the peripheral large arteries. The calcified character of the obstruction and the calcification of the aortic valve are characteristic of a variant type of CAD not associated with the same risk factors as diffuse coronary atherosclerosis, but, in this case, with rheumatic heart disease [2]. The role of inflammation without the presence of metabolic syndrome must be noted. The diffuse calcification of the aorta is part of an inflammatory condition and makes the need for nonsurgical intervention in this syndrome more likely.Valve disease in rheumatic heart disease has been well described as sequelae of B- and T-cell activation in response to autoantigens in those with certain HLA subtypes [3]. Indeed, molecular mimicry among streptococcal M5 proteins, myosin, and valve-derived proteins causes T-cell cross reactivity leading to inflammation of myocardial tissue. The presence of chronic inflammation is evidenced by the presence of INF-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10 in biopsied valve tissue in patients with rheumatic heart disease [4]. Chronic inflammation likely perpetuated this patient’s diffuse aortic and localized coronary calcifications ultimately requiring an otherwise appropriate CABG/SAVR candidate to undergo left coronary artery PCI and TAVR.After an extensive literature research, including PubMed and Embase, on the use of TAVR for rheumatic aortic valve stenosis, we found only two articles presenting case reports on the topic. Bilge et al. presented two case reports of patients with rheumatic aortic stenosis and various comorbidities excluding them from open procedures. These patients ultimately underwent TAVR with a specific prosthetic valve [5]. Akujuo et al. presented a case in which TAVR was combined with transcatheter mitral valve implantation in a patient with both aortic and mitral valves affected by rheumatic valve stenosis [6].The results of our literature search bolster the viability of TAVR for patient with rheumatic aortic stenosis while simultaneously highlighting the need for further trials including this patient population. As patients with rheumatic heart disease are usually of younger age and less complex comorbid state, they are usually classified as intermediate surgical risk and have classically been managed surgically. With the practical application of the recent PARTNER 2 trial results for intermediate surgical risk patients, we may see more use of TAVR in patients with rheumatic heart disease [7].The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Accidental Entrapment of Electrical Mapping Catheter by Chiari’s Network in Right Atrium during Catheter Ablation Procedure
Division of Cardiology, Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu 431-3192,  JapanReceived 18 January 2016; Accepted 12 May 2016Academic Editor: Kurt C. Roberts-ThomsonCopyright © 2016 Atsushi Sakamoto et al.

His electrocardiogram (ECG) presented regular narrow QRS tachycardia with 170 bpm, and catheter ablation was planned. During electroanatomical mapping of the right atrium (RA) with a multiloop mapping catheter, the catheter head was entrapped nearby the ostium of inferior vena cava. Rotation and traction of the catheter failed to detach the catheter head from the RA wall. Exfoliation of connective tissue twined around catheter tip by forceps, which were designed for endomyocardial biopsy, succeeded to retract and remove the catheter. Postprocedural echocardiography and pathologic examination proved the existence of Chiari’s network. The handling of complex catheters in the RA has a potential risk of entrapment with Chiari’s network.Congenital cardiovascular abnormalities have a potential for causing several complications in routine catheter procedure. Chiari’s network, the fetal remnant of venous valve in the right atrium (RA), is one of the malformations [1]. We report a case of accidental entrapment of electrode catheter by Chiari’s network during catheter ablation procedure.A 78-year-old male was referred to our hospital because of frequent palpitation. Holter electrocardiography (ECG) revealed a narrow QRS tachycardia with regular 170 beats per minute (bpm) (Figure 1(a)). His 12-lead ECG showed normal sinus rhythm and intermittent complete right bundle branch block. The transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed normal ventricular function and no remarkable abnormality in intracardiac structure, although the observation was quite limited by attenuation artifacts caused by ribs and lung.After written informed consent was obtained, he underwent an electrophysiological study (EPS) under weak sedation with intravenous infusion of midazolam. Initially, a multipolar electrode catheter was introduced from the right femoral vein and positioned at the coronary sinus (CS). When the tip of electrode catheter attached to the RA wall, a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with heart rate of 133 bpm was induced immediately after the jump-up phenomenon (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)), suggesting a slow-fast atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. However, since the heart rate of previously detected SVT was 170 bpm, which was quite higher than the catheter-induced SVT, this patient had potentially two or more different types of SVT. Furthermore, this patient had a small Koch’s triangle, and the precise anatomical location of His bundle during slow pathway potential ablation had to be confirmed to avoid procedure induced atrioventricular block. Thus, we decided to use electroanatomical 3D mapping system (EnSite Velocity system, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota). To make geometry of the RA, we used Reflexion HD™ catheter (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota), a duodecapolar multiloop intracardiac mapping catheter, through Agilis™ steerable guiding introducer (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota).During an electroanatomical mapping of the RA, the head of mapping catheter was entrapped nearby the ostium of inferior vena cava. Rotation and traction of the catheter failed to detach the catheter head from the RA wall. Because frequent SVTs which were provoked by mechanically induced supraventricular premature beats disturbed our catheter removal procedure, we initially tried to treat SVT.Since the intracardiac ECG at the initiation and during SVT was compatible with slow-fast atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (Figure 1(c)), the radiofrequency (RF) application targeting the inferior side of Koch’s triangle, the anatomical approach of the slow pathway, was delivered targeting at 50 degrees with a maximum setting of 30 W (Blazer II, Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts) with careful attention not to induce atrioventricular block. After 4 times of RF application, the SVT could never be induced.Right atriography revealed that the entrapped catheter was distant from tricuspid valve and the catheter traction did not deform the RA shadow (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). The traction of the entrapped catheter did not induce supraventricular or ventricular premature beats. Thus, we decided to pull apart the catheter tip from twined connective tissues by using the forceps which were designed for endomyocardial biopsy (6 Fr 105 cm Biopsy Forceps, Technowood, Tokyo). We initially exfoliated the connective tissue twined around the catheter tip using the forceps (Figure 2(c)), pulled the catheter vigorously, and finally succeeded to retract and remove the catheter without any complications and surgical intervention. In the macroscopic finding, the fascicular connective tissue twined around the tip of the multiloop mapping catheter (Figure 3(a)). Later, the microscopic examination revealed an accumulation of interstitial tissue including elastic fiber and a patchy distribution of cardiomyocytes (Figures 3(b)–3(d)), which are compatible with Chiari’s network [2].Finally, we confirmed that the dual atrioventricular nodal physiology disappeared and any SVTs were not induced even under the isoproterenol infusion. The postprocedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed residual floating structures in the RA (Figure 4), suggesting the disrupted tissue of Chiari’s network.Chiari’s network is a congenital anatomical variation at the junction of the RA and superior and inferior vena cava. In 1897, Hans Chiari described the intricate fenestrated reticulum containing multiple threads inserting on the anterior surface of Eustachian valve, the posterior wall of the ostial inferior vena cava, crista terminalis, and the tubercle of Lower [1]. A fenestrated valve of CS (Thebesian valve) has also been called Chiari’s net. This structure is considered as embryological remnants of right valve of the sinus venosus and septum spurium that persisted after embryological development [1].The prevalence of Chiari’s network is reported to be approximately 2% with estimates varying from 1.3 to 4% in postmortem findings and 0.3 to 9.5% in TTE findings [1]. The previously reported clinical complications associated with Chiari’s network are the intra-RA thrombus formation [3] as well as the entrapment of thromboemboli [4], atrial tachyarrhythmia [5], and device entrapment [6–12]. To date, 9 cases of device entrapment with Chiari’s network have been reported. Entrapped devices were guidewires [6–8], pacemaker leads [9], right heart diagnostic catheter [11], atrial septal defect (ASD) closure device [10], and electrical mapping catheter [12]. Surgical resections were required in two cases [11, 12].The Reflexion HD™ catheter is a multiloop intracardiac mapping catheter that is designed to create highly detailed geometries and electrical maps in 3D mapping system. Although, at present, there is no report that this catheter is entrapped with intracardiac structure, it is likely that the catheter could twine toward fascicular structures due to the multispiral designs. In this case, the mobility of the catheter head in the RA was restricted from the beginning of intra-RA mapping. The catheter tip possibly twisted around the Chiari’s network just when the catheter was inserted to the RA. A number of rotations of the catheter for intra-RA mapping might make more complex binding to fascicular tissue and the catheter.This is a rare report of a successful bail out of catheter entrapment in Chiari’s network using the forceps. We recognized the risk of further complication such as the RA wall perforation and disruption of tricuspid valve by using the forceps in the RA [13, 14]. The traction of the entrapped catheter did not induce supraventricular and ventricular premature beats or deform the RA wall. Furthermore, the entrapped catheter was distant from tricuspid valve in the right atriography (Figure 2(b)). We considered that the risk of further complications was low and fortunately we succeeded to remove the catheter without any surgical intervention.In conclusion, the handling of complex catheters in the RA has a potential risk of entrapment with Chiari’s network. A careful observation of the RA prior to catheter ablation is recommended to prevent this complication.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Progressed Multivessel Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection That Naturally Healed in a Male Patient with Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction
Department of Cardiology, Saitama Eastern Cardiovascular Hospital, 3187-1 Osawa, Koshigaya, Saitama 343-0025,  JapanReceived 5 February 2016; Accepted 15 March 2016Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2016 Tatsuo Haraki et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare condition that may have a serious outcome because of acute coronary syndrome. The condition especially affects young women. We evaluated a middle-aged male patient with a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction caused by multivessel SCAD. The SCAD had occurred in the distal right coronary artery (RCA), the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD), and the distal LAD at the same time. His culprit lesion was in the distal RCA, but the SCAD had progressed more proximally within the RCA 12 days later with no clinical symptoms. We treated the mid LAD with implantation of a drug-eluting stent on admission and the SCAD had not progressed 12 days later. Moreover, the SCAD in the distal RCA and distal LAD healed spontaneously 12 days later. He had no recurrent attack, and all SCAD lesions of the RCA and LAD had completely healed 6 months later. Given that SCAD appears in various forms over the clinical course, a strategy of intervention needs careful consideration.Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare condition that predominantly affects young healthy women. It can sometimes cause serious outcomes because of sudden death and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The clinical features that give rise to suspicion of SCAD are (a) myocardial infarction (MI) in young women, especially those aged ≤50 years, (b) the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, (c) little or no evidence of typical atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries, (d) a peripartum condition, (e) a history of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), and (f) either emotional or physical (intensive exercise) precipitating stress events [1–3]. It has been reported that the frequency of ACS caused by multivessel SCAD was relatively high (observed in approximately 20% of cases), but the effects of interventional in-hospital treatment and long-term outcomes remain controversial [4–6]. We report on a case of a middle-aged male patient with an inferior non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) caused by multivessel SCAD. The SCAD in the distal right coronary artery (RCA) progressed more proximally but finally healed naturally with conservative treatment.A 49-year-old male had felt severe chest pain accompanied by a cold sweat during his evening work of garbage collection. The symptoms continued until the next morning when he consulted our hospital as a walk-in patient. He had no coronary risk factors but he had been taking a proton-pump inhibitor for regurgitant esophagitis for a few years. An electrocardiogram demonstrated abnormal Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF without an ST-T change. A chest X-ray showed no lung congestion. His CK (879 U/L), CK-MB (87 U/L), and troponin T (1.8 ng/mL) levels were all elevated. The echocardiography demonstrated hypokinesis in the inferoseptal wall of the left ventricle. Acute inferior NSTEMI was the suggested diagnosis and we started a loading dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) of 200 mg of aspirin and 20 mg of prasugrel, 96 mg/d of nicorandil, and 10000 units/d of heparin under a continuous intravenous injection. We also performed an emergent coronary angiogram (CAG).The CAG showed that the RCA had diffuse stenosis in the distal RCA which was not dilated by an isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) intracoronary injection (Figures 1(a1) and 1(a2)). The left circumflex artery (LCX) was normal, but the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was tortuous and mid LAD was focally near occlusion, identified by contrast staining (Figure 2(a1)). The more distal LAD showed diffuse severe stenosis which again did not dilate following an ISDN injection (Figure 2(a2)). We performed an intracoronary ultrasound (IVUS) near the occluded lesion in the mid LAD because his symptoms were not relieved. Double lumen and an intramural hematoma were found (Figures 3(b)–3(e)), but there were no atherosclerotic plaques. These findings were compatible with SCAD. His symptom worsened after the IVUS so we performed a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the mid LAD. The dissection spread after a conventional balloon angioplasty, so we implanted a 2.5 × 26 mm zotarolimus-eluting stent (Medtronic, Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA) in the mid LAD. The mid LAD was well dilated and received good blood flow after stent implantation (Figure 2(b1)), but the more distal LAD was still severely narrowed with contrast staining (Figure 2(b2)). Cardiac rehabilitation was performed after the PCI and he had no recurrent chest pain or ischemia.We performed a follow-up CAG 12 days after the MI onset. The stenting site in the mid LAD was patent, and the distal LAD was dilated compared with that on admission (Figure 2(c2)). The distal RCA was also dilated compared with that on admission, but the area proximal to the mid RCA showed progression of luminal narrowing (Figures 1(b1) and 1(b2)). The IVUS confirmed an intramural hematoma proximal to the distal RCA and double lumen was observed in spots (Figures 4(b)–4(i)). The SCAD had tended to spread to a more proximal lesion of the RCA 12 days after the onset of the MI. In contrast, the dissection had not spread to the proximal lesion in the stent implanted LAD, and the distal LAD lesion was healing. Although we had selected a conservative therapy for the RCA, he had no recurrence over the next 6 months. Spontaneous healing of the SCAD was observed in both the whole RCA (Figures 1(c1) and 1(c2)) and the LAD (Figures 2(d1) and 2(d2)), as confirmed by a CAG and by an IVUS (Figure 5) 6 months after the onset of the MI.We evaluated a case of a middle-aged male patient with NSTEMI caused by multivessel SCAD. The SCAD was observed in the distal RCA and in the mid and distal LAD at the same time on admission. The SCAD of the distal RCA had spread more proximally 12 days later, but it finally healed naturally with conservative treatment. Our patient had an absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, but he had participated in intensive exercise (garbage collection) at the onset of the SCAD. A renal angiogram showed no findings of FMD.SCAD is caused by an intraluminal hemorrhage or intimal tear, but an angiographic diagnosis is difficult because diffuse stenosis is common. An angiographic SCAD diagnosis is categorized as Type 1 (evident of arterial wall stain) in 29.1%; Type 2 (diffuse stenosis of varying severity) in 67.0%; and Type 3 (mimic atherosclerosis) in 3.9% [7]. Therefore, IVUS and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are established and valuable tools for the diagnosis of SCAD [8].Although his culprit lesion was considered to be in the distal RCA, we treated the mid LAD with implantation of a drug-eluting stent (DES) at the onset of MI. At that time, we performed IVUS at near-occluded lesion in the mid LAD because his symptoms were not relieved. IVUS findings could show that SCAD had occurred in this patient. In contrast, we did not perform an evaluation by IVUS in the RCA, because his distal RCA with diffuse, severe narrowing seemed to be unsuitable for IVUS study. Interestingly, his RCA showed mimic atherosclerotic changes from the proximal to mid RCA 12 days later. We speculated that the SCAD had naturally spread more proximally in the RCA. In contrast, the SCAD lesion in the mid LAD, which we treated with stent implantation, had not spread more proximally in the LAD. A progressive SCAD was reported in 10% of SCAD patients and occurred generally within seven days [9]. In contrast, spontaneous healing was found in most patients following conservative treatment confirmed by a CAG >26 days later [7].PCI for SCAD was associated with high rates of technical failure, even in those who presented with a preserved vessel flow, while a strategy of conservative management with prolonged observation was associated with good early and long-term outcomes [9]. One reason for the high technical failure rates of PCI may be because of less frequent usage (18%) of imaging modality compared with an IVUS or OCT [9]. Imaging modality could distinguish the guidewire position from the true to false lumen as well as the distribution of the SCAD. We achieved full coverage in the mid LAD of SCAD lesion with stent implantation by IVUS guidance. Technical success was achieved by full coverage of the SCAD lesion with stent implantation [10], or by cutting balloon angioplasty which could reduce an intramural hematoma with OCT guidance [11], and by spot stenting which could cover the entry point of intimal tear with OCT guidance [12]. These procedures using imaging modality may prevent further progression of SCAD and lead to higher success rate of PCI.We selected zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES) implantation in the mid LAD, because the culprit of luminal size was relatively small (reference vessel diameter of 2.23 mm). Clinical trial using the ZES in the small coronary vessels demonstrated that the suppression of the neointimal hyperplasia, lower in-stent late lumen loss, and good long-term clinical outcomes were observed in the Japanese patients [13]. However, it is reported that stent malapposition because of the resorption of intramural hematoma was observed by OCT in several patients with SCAD who were treated with DES [14]. If DES is selected for the treatment of the SCAD lesions, the delayed healing in the lesion with major dissection should be considered. In addition, long-term DAPT may disturb the thrombus formation within the false lumen. Incomplete stent apposition, which was observed by CAG as a peristent contrast staining (PSS) after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation, is associated with very late stent thrombosis [15]. Therefore, repeat CAG as well as OCT and/or IVUS study should be recommended before the cessation of DAPT, if DES treatment is chosen for the SCAD lesions.In contrast, another report indicated that a more conservative strategy was associated with better in-hospital outcomes compared with revascularization therapy [16]. However, no significant differences were observed in the long-term outcomes. This could be explained by a high recurrent SCAD rate of 10%–27% at 2–5 years’ follow-up [7, 9], which included new lesions as well as initially diseased vessels [9, 17].Thus, a more conservative therapy is commonly recommended unless there are features of ongoing/recurrent ischemia, hemodynamic and electrical instability, and left main or proximal segment LAD, LCX, and RCA dissections [1–5]. We selected stent implantation at the mid LAD and conservative treatment at the RCA of the SCAD lesion. There is a possibility that stent implantation may prevent progression of the SCAD at the acute phase. However, the SCAD progression in the RCA also finally healed with conservative treatment, which indicated that it may be preferable to select conservative treatment when the patient is clinically stable. Moreover, it is important to avoid the origin and trigger after the onset of SCAD.We evaluated a male patient with NSTEMI caused by multivessel SCAD. The SCAD of the distal RCA progressed to a proximal lesion 12 days later. A stent implanted in the mid LAD did not progress to a proximal lesion 12 days later, and the whole RCA and LAD were finally healed 6 months after the onset of the MI. Progressive SCAD was observed 12 days after the onset of the MI, but spontaneous healing was observed in both lesions with conservative and stent implantation treatment 6 months later. Considering that SCAD may appear in variable forms over the clinical course, a careful consideration of whether to use conservative or interventional therapy treatment options is required. The use of imaging modality, such as IVUS or OCT, should be considered when PCI is chosen at the time of acute phase as well as follow-up period.The authors declare no competing interests.Tatsuo Haraki did the cardiac catheterization and intervention, and Ryota Uemura, Shin-ichiro Masuda, and Takeshi Lee also participated in the treatment of this patient.

Fibrinolytic Treatment after Transient Ischaemic Attack Caused by Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombosis
Immanuel Hospital Bernau Brandenburg Heart Center, Medical School Brandenburg, Ladeburger Straße 17, 16321 Bernau,  GermanyReceived 10 March 2016; Accepted 5 May 2016Academic Editor: Filippo M. SarulloCopyright © 2016 Cornel Koban et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Prosthetic valve thrombosis is one of the most severe complications after surgical valve replacement. There are many possible presentations: from asymptomatic to life-threatening complications. We report on a 61-year-old female patient with prosthetic replacement of the aortic and mitral valve in the in-house department of cardiac surgery 3 months ago. The patient was suffering from aphasia during 5 minutes in domesticity. After her presentation in the emergency room, the echocardiographic examination revealed a thrombotic formation of the prosthetic mitral valve. At presentation, the anticoagulation was outside the effective range (INR: 1.7). A successful thrombolytic therapy with the plasminogen activator urokinase was begun with complete resolution of the thrombus.Prosthetic valve thrombosis is one of the most severe complications after a surgical valve replacement and in most cases caused by insufficient anticoagulation [1]. Phenprocoumon and Coumarine-derivatives are the only approved anticoagulants after a prosthetic valve replacement.There are many possible presentations of a prosthetic valve thrombosis: from being asymptomatic to syncope, stroke, lung edema, or life-threatening cardiogenic shock [2].There is a lack of randomized controlled prospective trials in the available literature comparing surgical and thrombolytic therapy in prosthetic valve thrombosis. However, in the literature, many therapy regimens are discussed and still remain controversial [1, 3].We report on a 61-year-old female patient with prosthetic replacement of the aortic and mitral valve in the in-house department of cardiac surgery 3 months ago due to a combined aortic and mitral valve disease with prevalent valve stenosis. At home, the patient was suffering from aphasia for 5 minutes. There was no evidence of peripheral neurologic deficiency. On hospital admission, an insufficient anticoagulation with an INR of 1.8 was noticeable.There was an adherent thrombotic formation on the prosthetic mitral valve in the echocardiographic examination. Subsequently, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which revealed a floating 16 × 6 mm hypodensic structure (previously AML) and a structure of 6 × 2 mm in size (previously PML) on the ring of the mitral valve prosthesis (Figure 1). The mean gradient was moderately to severely elevated to 10 mmHg (Figure 2). The left ventricular function was preserved and there were no thrombotic formations detectable in the left atrial appendix.Taking the transient neurologic symptoms into account, a CT-scan of the brain was performed. There was neither an evidence of an intracerebral bleeding nor a demarcation of a territorial ischaemia.After carefully weighting of advantages and disadvantages of a required high dose heparinization for the heart-lung machine (initial bolus heparin 400 IU/kg BW, further dosing to reach an ACT around 500 seconds, terminating with the antagonist protamine necessary), we decided to initiate a first-line low-dose thrombolytic treatment with the plasminogen-activator urokinase on the basis of several years experience (bolus 250.000 IU, maintenance dose 80.000 IU) for 48 hours with concomitant unfractionated heparinization 75 IU/kg/24 h to reach a 1.5-time prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time. Finally, the phenprocoumon therapy was reestablished.After completion of the thrombolytic therapy, a second transesophageal examination was performed. The floating structures were no longer detected and the mean gradient decreased to 7 mmHg (Figure 3).Only one of the 7 blood cultures was positive for propionibacterium acnes. This was probably due to a contamination. After one week, new blood cultures were carried out. These showed no germ grove.After completion of the thrombolytic therapy, the reintroduction of the oral anticoagulants under concomitant unfractionated heparinization was established. An adjuvant ASA medication and a Koagucheck®-Device for INR self-monitoring were prescribed. Discharge from hospital was without subsequent neurological damage.Valve thrombosis is one of the most common complications after prosthetic valve replacement with an incidence of 0.3 to 1.3 over 100 patient years. The prosthetic mitral valve is affected twice as often as the prosthetic aortic valve. Most of them are nonobstructive [4]. Thromboembolic complications are more frequent and occur in 0.7–6% per patient-year [5–7].During the first year after prosthetic valve replacement, an incidence of 24% adherent thrombotic material is reported; during the years 2 to 5, the incidence is about 15% and decreases still further [8]. Technological progress with new valve design leads to a more laminar flow with less thrombogenicity according to Virchow’s triad [7].Oral anticoagulants are restricted to phenprocoumon substances that are approved for prosthetic heart valves although direct anticoagulants cause less interactions with comedication and nutrition. The Re-Align-Trial with dabigatran and prosthetic valves was prematurely terminated due to bleeding and thromboembolic complications [9]. The benefit of the adjuvant aspirin therapy remains unclear; there are fewer valve thromboses reported but nevertheless more frequent gastrointestinal bleeding [10].The transthoracic echocardiographic examination is recommended as the first diagnostic tool of valve thrombosis offering basic information on valve morphology and function. Transesophageal echocardiography is often required to provide more accurate images and to distinguish between pannus and thrombus. A thrombus has usually an echodensity similar to the myocardium while pannus appears more hyperechoic [10].Since the nineteen-eighties, only radiopaque valve prosthesis was used so that fluoroscopy may also be useful for assessment of valve function by showing restriction of valve leaflet movements in case of prosthetic valve thrombosis [10].If a cut-off smaller than 5 mm is used for defining small thrombi, the majority of 80% with large thrombi on left-heart sided prosthetic heart valves suffer from serious systemic embolization [4, 11, 12].Up to the 1990s, surgery was the preferred treatment in the case of thrombosis of prosthetic heart valves. Depending on the preoperative state of the patient, the mortality rate of surgical thrombectomy or valve replacement was approximately 69% [13, 14].During recent years, the thrombolytic therapy is increasingly performed to spare the patient surgery. The TROIA-Trial compared a variety of thrombolytic regimes. Different authors recorded a successful thrombolysis in 73–83% [12, 15–17]. Possible complications might be reversible systemic embolization in 10−18% [15, 18, 19]. Fatal outcomes are reported in 2.8–11.8% [15, 20–22].Low-dose fibrinolytic prolonged regimens with tPA should lower complication rates further. For this purpose, the SAFE-PVT-Trial (Surgery versus Fibrinolytic Therapy for Left-Sided Prosthetic Heart Valve Thrombosis, NCT01641549) is currently in progress. A second ongoing study compares surgery and thrombolytic therapy in patients with obstructive prosthetic valve thrombosis (NCT02243839). There is no consensus in the literature concerning the best fibrinolytic regimen. A simple therapeutic strategy can be proposed with two types of protocols. In patients with haemodynamic instability, “rescue” fibrinolysis should be preferred, using a “short protocol.” Clinical stable patients should be included in a “long protocol.”The clinical outcome of small thrombi smaller than 5 mm is mostly benign and requires an adaption of the oral anticoagulants. Patients with larger nonobstructive thrombi develop more often further complications and require a more aggressive therapeutic regimen. Bridging the gap in the anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin until the reachievement of the required INR-range is one of the early goals. The adjuvant aspirin therapy leads to fewer valve thromboses; however, more often gastrointestinal bleeding is to be noticed. In recent years, a first-line fibrinolytic therapy is performed more often, but more kinds of reversible systemic embolization are recorded. If primary therapy, based on thrombolytic treatment, fails, therapists should consider resurgery, but taking the risks, as outlined, into consideration.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
A Combination of Two Rare Coronary Anomalies Makes It Even Rarer: Right Sided Single Coronary Artery with Dual Left Anterior Descending Artery

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.An 82-year-old female with history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension presented to the clinic with chief complaint of nonradiating chest tightness accompanied by exertional dyspnea. Cardiac catheterization showed the absence of left coronary system; the entire coronary system originated from the right aortic sinus as a common trunk which then gave off the right coronary artery and the left main coronary artery. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated also another rare coronary anomaly: dual left anterior descending artery. Patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and subsequent multidetector computed tomography angiography confirmed the above angiography findings. Patient was subsequently discharged home on double antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel and has been asymptomatic since then.In a single coronary artery (SCA) the entire coronary tree arises as a single trunk from ascending aorta and no evidence of second coronary artery is found [1]. The prevalence of SCA in angiographic series fluctuates between 0.014 and 0.066 percent [2, 3]. In 43 percent of cases SCA is associated with other major congenital heart anomalies [1]. Dual left anterior descending (LAD) artery was first described by Spindola-Franco et al. in 1983. Based on conventional coronary angiography and CT angiography data the prevalence of dual LAD is estimated to be 1% and 4%, respectively [4, 5].An 82-year-old female with history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension presented to the clinic with chief complaint of nonradiating chest tightness with exertion which started several months before this presentation but got significantly worse in the last one month. Patient had normal vital signs and unremarkable physical examination. The patient’s home medications were simvastatin, metoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate, and aspirin. The patient had a stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging study five months prior to the presentation results which did not show inducible ischemia. 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed T wave inversions in lateral precordial leads that were unchanged from ECG five months earlier. Cardiac biomarkers were within normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of 60%, and no valvular abnormalities were found. Decision was made to perform elective cardiac catheterization.A 5-French sheath was placed over the guidewire into the right femoral artery. The left coronary system was not present; the entire coronary system originated from the right aortic sinus as a common trunk which then gave off the right coronary artery (RCA) and the left main coronary artery (LMCA) (Figure 1). The common trunk was cannulated with a 5-French right Judkins catheter tip #4. Distal LAD was found to have 95% stenosis in its midportion. A significant lesion in diagonal artery up to 95% was found with fair distal antegrade flow. RCA was dominant compared to the left system and appeared to have two lesions, one in the posterior descending artery (PDA) branch up to 90% and another one in posterolateral branch up to 80%. Left ventricular (LV) angiography showed good LV contractility. Subsequently four drug eluting stents (DES) were placed in diagonal artery (2.25  18 mm), distal LAD (2.25  12 mm), PDA (3.0  23 mm), and posterolateral branch of RCA (2.25  18 mm) with excellent TIMI 3 flow.64-row multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanner (Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS 64 slice scanner, Germany) was used to further characterize the course of anomalous coronary artery. Images were acquired in the craniocaudal direction with 0.6 mm slice thickness. It confirmed cardiac catheterization findings showing entire coronary system originating from the right aortic sinus (Figure 2). The LMCA coursed in a retroaortic fashion between the aorta and the left atrium on its way to the left ventricle. The LMCA bifurcated into the proximal and mid-LAD artery as well as the Cx. Only the proximal and mid-LAD originated from LMCA. The distal LAD originated separately from the right coronary artery and then coursed anterior to the pulmonary artery on its way to the left ventricle supplying the distal portion of the anterior intraventricular groove.Patient was subsequently discharged home on double antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel and has been asymptomatic since then.This type of SCA is classified as RII-P according to Lipton classification. In this type of SCA the entire coronary tree arises as a common trunk from the right coronary sinus dividing into right coronary artery (RCA) which has a normal course and left main coronary artery (LMCA). Then LMCA crosses the base of the heart turning posteriorly behind the aorta dividing into LAD and Cx arteries [6]. In the malignant or interarterial type of this anomaly when LMCA crosses between aorta and pulmonary artery patients might present with sudden death due to compression and kinking of LMCA especially during physical exertion [2, 7, 8]. Otherwise the posterior variant (this case) does not carry increased cardiovascular risk in the absence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) and other congenital cardiac abnormalities [1, 7, 9]. However 15% of SCA patients have myocardial ischemia in the absence of atherosclerotic CAD which might be a direct result of abnormal coronary anatomy [10]. Because of its rarity there are currently no guidelines on the management of patients with SCA. Revascularization is indicated in cases of atherosclerotic CAD and ischemia [11]. Invasive management strategies in patients with SCA and atherosclerotic CAD are very rare and pose high risk since cannulation of common trunk by large catheter might be poorly tolerated given the fact that the whole heart gets its supply from that common single trunk [12].The uniqueness of our case is the combination of SCA with another rare coronary anomaly: dual LAD. Dual LAD is defined as bifurcation of anterior descending artery into a short LAD terminating in proximal anterior interventricular sulcus (AIVS) and the long LAD that has variable course returning to AIVS distally. Short LAD supplies the anterior interventricular septum and the long LAD supplies anterolateral wall and the apex. So far 9 subtypes of dual LAD have been described by different authors. Our case represents type IV of dual LAD where long LAD arises from RCA lying on the anterior surface of the right ventricle and sharply turning to descend into the AIVS (Figure 3). Recognition of anatomic variants of dual LAD is crucial for correct identification of these vessels during surgery and coronary interventions for coronary artery disease [4, 5].The authors report no financial relationships or competing interests regarding the content herein.The authors acknowledge the library research assistance provided by HSHS St. John’s Hospital Health Sciences Library staff.
Percutaneous Punctured Transcatheter Device Closure of Residual Shunt after Ventricular Septal Defect Repair
Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, the Affiliated Children’s Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210000,  ChinaReceived 10 March 2016; Accepted 4 May 2016Academic Editor: Takatoshi KasaiCopyright © 2016 Xuming Mo et al.

Although a residual shunt is the most common complication of VSD surgery, a second operation that applies the surgical repair method is very difficult because it can increase the possibility of uncontrolled bleeding and the severity of tissue adhesion. Here, we present the first case of percutaneous punctured transcatheter device closure of a residual shunt after VSD repair as a novel method to further develop for the treatment of children with congenital heart disease.Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common type of major human birth malformation, affecting approximately 8 per 1,000 live births. Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are estimated to account for 20 to 30% of all cases of congenital heart disease [1]. The first VSD repair was performed by Lillehei and associates in 1954 [2]. Although a residual shunt is the most common complication of VSD surgery, a second operation that applies the surgical repair method is very difficult and can increase the possibility of uncontrolled bleeding and the severity of tissue adhesion [3]. Here, we present a new avenue for the treatment of a postoperative residual shunt in VSD. We also describe the technical considerations required to perform percutaneous punctured transcatheter device closure of the residual shunt after VSD repair, and we discuss the advantages for employing these unconventional approaches.In March 2015, a 4-year-old female patient was admitted with a residual shunt after VSD repair. She was diagnosed with congenital VSD and pulmonary hypertension when she was born. We had previously performed a thoracotomy on this patient to repair the VSD in September 2010. During long-term follow-up after surgery, an ultrasonic cardiogram (UCG) showed a 5.7 mm diameter residual shunt under the patch and mild tricuspid regurgitation, with pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 27 mmHg and pulmonary circulatory blood volume/systemic circulation volume  of 1.45. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed left atrial rhythms and an incomplete right bundle branch block. On March 5, we performed percutaneous punctured transcatheter device closure of the VSD.In the horizontal position, transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) assessment of the VSD was performed following the induction of general anaesthesia. TEE was utilized with every procedure to guide the conveyor system and to assess ventricular function and device interventions.Guided by TEE, we punctured directly through the right ventricular surface into the right ventricle with an 18 G needle in the 4th intercostal space of the left sternal border, and then we inserted the guide wire into the left ventricle through the sheath (Figure 1). Next, we extracted the guide wire after inserting a conveyor tube. Subsequently, an 8 mm single-rivet double-plate closure device (WTSQFDQ-II 08, Shanghai Shape Memory Alloy, Ltd., China) was delivered via the conveyor tube (Figure 2). First, we released the left ventricular surface of the closure device, and then we released the right surface after moderate traction. TEE showed no shunt and no effect on the valve (Figure 3). Then, we retracted the conveyor and conducted compression haemostasis on the puncture site. A complete TEE examination was performed and revealed no significant pericardial effusion. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. UCG postoperatively showed the VSD closure device on site, with no pericardial effusion and no obvious morphological abnormalities of the valve. The patient has recovered very well.Surgical repair has been considered the gold standard for the treatment of most VSDs because it allows for direct visual access to the defect. Open-heart surgical repair requires cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), as well as total sternotomy, which is physically and psychologically traumatic, particularly for paediatric patients [4]. Furthermore, percutaneous transcatheter device closure of the VSD can cause several adverse events, such as arrhythmia and device embolism, as well as vascular complications [5]. This patient’s UCG showed a 5.9 mm residual shunt located under the pericardium patch and more than 2 mm from the tricuspid valve. According to the general condition and UCG of this patient, we created a new hybrid operative method to repair the residual shunt. With TEE guidance, we punctured the right ventricle with the 18 G needle directly through the right ventricular surface, and then we inserted the guide wire into the left ventricle through the sheath. Subsequently, the 8 mm closure device was released. This method helps to avoid the risk of open surgical repair and percutaneous transcatheter device closure. This method also offers a new avenue for the treatment of postoperative residual shunts in primary VSD and pulmonary valve replacement.In summary, this was the first case of this type of surgery. Currently, we have performed three cases of this type of operation, and the patients have recovered very well. This method requires the surgeon to have extensive experience because selection of the puncture site must be very accurate during the operation. This method does not allow multiple choices of puncture sites, which would result in cardiac tamponade because of excessive bleeding. This surgery was attempted experimentally by our team, and our experience was far from sufficient. We hope to gain more experience and to conduct more extensive follow-up after surgery with the aim of providing a new, more secure, efficient, and reliable method of treatment for children with congenital heart disease.The design and performance of the current study involving human subjects were clearly described in a research protocol.This study was approved by the institutional review board of Nanjing Medical University and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.Written informed consent was obtained from the parents for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Xuming Mo conceived and drafted the paper.

A Benign Cardiac Growth but Not So Indolent

Wani et al.

Due to its benign nature it rarely requires intervention. Its presence outside the interatrial septum is reported infrequently. We present a case of lipomatous hypertrophy in the intraventricular septum that was complicated by a severe, symptomatic, and disabling dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The symptoms significantly improved following the excision of the mass. In our case transthoracic echocardiogram was used to visualize the mass and measure the severity of the obstruction; Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging was used to characterize the mass and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis.Cardiac lipomatous hypertrophy is a rare condition, which was first described in 1964 involving the interatrial septum (IAS). It is rarely diagnosed because of lack of specific clinical symptoms. The reported incidence on autopsy series was 1–2.2%. Histologically, cardiac lipomatous hypertrophy differs from a lipoma by its location in the IAS, absence of a capsule, and the presence of fetal fatty tissue. Its presence in the myocardium outside of the IAS has been reported very infrequently. Furthermore, it is typically a benign finding requiring no intervention. We present a case of lipomatous hypertrophy in the intraventricular septum complicated by severe, symptomatic, and disabling dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.A 54-year-old Caucasian male presented with eight-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath. Five years before, on a routine physical examination, he was found to have a harsh systolic murmur along the left upper sternal border for which he underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The TTE showed mild systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve with significant left ventricular outflow tract gradient. A definite septal abnormality could not be excluded based on the TTE. Subsequently, he underwent a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) to characterize the lesion and was found to have a basal anterior septal mass measuring 15.2 × 5.9 mm. The signal intensity by T1 and T2 was consistent with fatty tissue. Moderate LVOT acceleration was also noticed in the vicinity of the septal mass. The LVOT gradient was further evaluated by an exercise stress echocardiography which demonstrated a resting LVOT gradient of 10 mmHg that significantly increased to 69 mmHg at 79% of maximal predicted heart rate and returned to baseline at a heart rate of 88 bpm. It also showed a significant bileaflet systolic anterior motion of mitral valve at peak heart rate as compared to the baseline without any significant mitral regurgitation. No intervention was performed due to lack symptoms and good functional capacity. He was followed up with a CMR every other year, which showed small increments in size but he remained clinically asymptomatic.Eight months prior to this report, he started experiencing dyspnea with exertion which progressively worsened. During this presentation his cardiac examination demonstrated a loud crescendo-decrescendo 5/6 systolic ejection murmur along left sternal border that worsened with Valsalva. A TTE was performed which demonstrated the previously visualized nonmobile septal mass (Figure 1) and a trace mitral regurgitation. It also demonstrated a marked increase in the peak systolic pressure gradient across the LVOT reaching 246 mmHg with Valsalva compared to the previous echo (Figure 2). His blood pressure on that day was 142/60 mmHg. Taking this into account his left ventricular peak systolic pressure was >350 mmHg. There must have been a component of contamination by the mitral regurgitation, but irrespective of that he undoubtedly had a significantly high pressure gradient across the LVOT. For better tissue characterization, a CMR was repeated which demonstrated an interval increase in the size of mass to 21 × 7 mm (Figure 3). Postgadolinium images did not show any evidence of uptake and there was no involvement of the subendocardium or the valves. It also showed a moderate mitral regurgitation with posteriorly directed jet along with LVOT turbulence.The patient was referred for surgical evaluation and he underwent a surgical resection of the mass via transaortic approach. Intraoperatively the mass was identified as a fibrofatty tissue, which was resected without any complications. His postoperative course was uneventful. His symptoms significantly improved after the surgery permitted him to resume work.Histopathological examination of the excised specimen showed benign hypertrophic myocardial muscle cells which revealed variation in the size and shapes of the nuclei. These myocytes were dispersed in between unencapsulated mature adipocytes with vacuolated cytoplasm. There were no mitotic figures or signet ring structures and the adipocyte nuclei were not hyperchromatic or indented, which ruled out liposarcoma (Figures 5(a): low power and 5(b): magnified).At the two-month follow-up visit he felt exceptionally well and had resumed all his activities without any limitation. A repeat echocardiogram showed a resting pressure gradient of 7 mmHg (Figure 4(a)) and peaking at 33 mmHg with Valsalva maneuver (Figure 4(b)) that was significantly improved from the presurgical gradient of 246 mmHg.Fatty deposition of the heart is very common especially in the western world. Most common sites include the subepicardial region particularly adjacent to coronary arteries; right atrial and ventricular wall; atrial septum; areas of scarring in left ventricular free wall; infrequently the left atrial wall; and extremely rare in the interventricular septum [1–3]. Lipomatous hypertrophy (LH) is the exaggerated growth of the fatty tissue infiltrating into the myocardium. It can be differentiated from the lipoma by its lack of discrete capsule and the composition of both mature adipocytes and fetal fat cells. This abnormality is more common than a cardiac lipoma and is typically associated with obesity and aging [4].Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum has been described commonly in the literature [5]. It is mostly diagnosed on an autopsy and also as an incidental finding on TTE examination. Fyke III et al. described 17 cases, with the most common presenting symptom being palpitations. Several of the cases also presented with angina. Arrhythmias (mostly supraventricular) and even sudden cardiac death had been reported in a few cases.Involvement of interventricular septum with LH is extremely rare. Verberkmoes et al. [4] described a 71-year-old woman with a membranous ventricular septal defect who was found to have a 40 × 35 mm echo-dense mass in the right atrium that intraoperatively was found to involve the atrial septum, left atrium, and the right ventricle. Resected tissue on pathological examination showed lipomatous hypertrophy. Nezafati et al. [6] reported a 27-year-old woman with a systolic murmur who was found to have a nonencapsulated echogenic mass in the interventricular septum extending in the right ventricular outflow tract. Histologic study revealed “benign lipomatous hypertrophy.” Heyer et al. [7] described a large hyperechogenic mass protruding into the right ventricular cavity and the outflow tract, which was homogenous and had an infiltrating pattern on the Cardiac MR. Pathologic examination showed adipocyte proliferating between the hypertrophic cardiac myocytes without any fibrous capsule covering the mass.Tissue characterization of the cardiac masses is difficult to establish on an echocardiogram. Cardiac CT and MR due to their high spatial resolution have been shown to be superior in characterizing intracardiac masses [7, 8]. A fat attenuation on a cardiac MRI can help to exclude myxoma, rhabdomyoma, fibroma, and/or mesothelioma. A homogenous mass with high signal density similar to subcutaneous fat has been found to be suggestive of a LH [9].Although dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is a common association with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM), it has never been reported to be caused by a lipomatous hypertrophy. An LVOT blood outflow acceleration due to the presence of an obstruction causing lift and drag resulting in the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (Venturi Effect) can explain the high peak aortic pressure gradient as seen in our case [10]. Surgical management is infrequently performed in patients with minimal symptoms. Surgery should be limited to LH complicated by severe rhythm disorders, superior vena-cava syndrome, outflow obstruction, or altered hemodynamic cardiac function leading to congestive heart failure [11]. The combination of echocardiography and CMR to define the anatomy and physiology of this rare case of “malignant” lipomatous hypertrophy were instrumental and underscore their use in rare cases of seemingly benign cardiac masses.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the submission of this paper.
Severe Left Ventricular Hypertrophy, Small Pericardial Effusion, and Diffuse Late Gadolinium Enhancement by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Suspecting Cardiac Amyloidosis: Endomyocardial Biopsy Reveals an Unexpected Diagnosis
1Department of Cardiology & Vascular Medicine, GRN Hospital Weinheim, 69469 Weinheim,  Germany2Department of Molecular Pathology, University Hospital Tübingen, Tübingen,  Germany3Department of Radiology, GRN Hospital Weinheim, 69469 Weinheim,  GermanyReceived 31 January 2016; Revised 16 April 2016; Accepted 24 April 2016Academic Editor: Gianluca Di BellaCopyright © 2016 Nina P. Hofmann et al.

Although the presence of LV hypertrophy is generally associated with poorer cardiac outcomes, the early differentiation between these pathologies is crucial due to the presence of specific treatment options. The diagnostic process with LV hypertrophy requires the integration of clinical evaluation, electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, biochemical markers, and if required CMR and endomyocardial biopsy in order to reach the correct diagnosis. Here, we present a case of a patient with severe LV hypertrophy (septal wall thickness of 23 mm, LV mass of 264 g, and LV mass index of 147 g/m2), severely impaired longitudinal function, and preserved radial contractility (ejection fraction = 55%), accompanied by small pericardial effusion and diffuse late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Due to the imaging findings, an infiltrative cardiomyopathy, such as cardiac amyloidosis, was suspected. However, amyloid accumulation was excluded by endomyocardial biopsy, which revealed the presence of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in an advanced hypertensive heart disease.Increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, referred to as LV hypertrophy, is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [1]. LV hypertrophy can be related to a multitude of cardiac or systemic diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), cardiac amyloidosis, Anderson-Fabry disease, and hypertensive heart disease [2–4]. The clinical presentation of all of these disorders is highly variable from being asymptomatic to sudden death, whereas they usually lead to congestive heart failure in their advanced stages.Amyloidosis is characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid, as a result of misfolding of a precursor protein, the most common of which are light chains, transthyretin, and serum amyloid A [5]. Cardiac involvement is common and represents an adverse predictor of outcome with amyloidosis [4]. HCM, on the other hand, is caused by mutation of sarcomeric genes and is associated with concentric LV hypertrophy [3]. In some patients, HCM progresses to congestive heart failure with poor clinical outcome [6]. In addition, arterial hypertension is the most common cause of LV hypertrophy due to pressure overload, which can also progress to hypertensive heart disease associated with heart failure with or without preserved LV ejection fraction [2]. Due to advances in the antihypertensive treatment, the burden of hypertensive heart diseases decreased during the last decades [7].In clinical routine, the diagnostic workup of patients with LV hypertrophy is important due to specific therapeutic strategies aiming at the different disease etiologies. Here, we present a case where the presence of cardiac amyloidosis was suspected based on cardiac imaging findings. However, endomyocardial biopsy revealed an unexpected diagnosis.A 56-year-old male patient was referred to our department due to exertional dyspnea and gradual decrease of his exercise tolerance within the last 6 months. The patient had no history of cardiac diseases and no history of arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Physical examination revealed normal heart sounds, no murmurs, and mild peripheral edema with clear lung fields. Blood pressure was elevated at 180/90 mmHg with normal pulse of 58 bpm. An ECG suggested a sinus rhythm without signs of myocardial ischemia or low QRS voltage but negative T-waves in V4–V6. Echocardiography, on the other hand, revealed the presence of severe LV hypertrophy (Figures 1(a)–1(f)) with septal wall thickness of 20 mm, preserved radial wall motion, and LV ejection fraction but strongly diminished longitudinal function (Figures 1(g) and 1(h)) (mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) = 7 mm; mean longitudinal strain = −11.1%; ejection fraction = 55%). In addition, granular sparkling of the myocardium was observed and small pericardial effusion was noticed, without hemodynamic relevance (orange arrows in Figures 1(b) and 1(e)). High-sensitive troponin T (hsTnT) was elevated (32 pg/mL), whereas renal function and C-reactive protein were normal. In addition, light chains and protein in urine were within the normal range (Table 1).Because echocardiographic findings were indicative of a myocardial infiltrative disease, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was subsequently performed. CMR confirmed the presence of severe LV hypertrophy (septal wall thickness: 23 mm; lateral wall thickness: 18 mm; LV mass: 264 g; and LV mass index: 147 g/m2), small pericardial effusion, and impaired longitudinal wall motion with an ejection fraction of 54% (Figures 2(a)–2(f)). In addition, late gadolinium enhancement exhibited a diffuse LGE pattern in the 4-chamber view and patchy LGE pattern in the inferior-lateral wall, suspecting cardiac amyloidosis (Figures 2(g) and 2(h)). Based on all the echocardiographic and CMR imaging findings and due to suspected cardiac amyloidosis, the patient was scheduled for cardiac catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy. Coronary angiography excluded the presence of significant coronary artery disease and several biopsies could be harvested from the left ventricle. From paraffin-embedded cardiac tissue, routine cardiopathologic staining and immunohistochemistry were performed. Congo red stain excluded the presence of amyloid in the heart. In addition, no apple-green birefringence was observed in the heart tissue of our patient under polarized light in Figures 3(a) and 3(b). Masson’s trichrome stain, on the other hand, demonstrated the presence of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and a diffuse interstitial fibrosis including microfoci of collagen scars (blue areas in Figure 3(c)). Quantification analysis as obtained by the programme Quantuepatho showed an area of fibrosis of 7% in our patient (Figure 3(d)) [8]. This percentage is higher compared to normal heart tissue, which contains very low amounts of fibrous perimysial collagen and less than 3% fibrosis [9]. In addition, immunohistochemical stains for desmin and CD68 stains suggested the absence of myocardial texture disorders and macrophage infiltration (Figures 3(a)–3(f)).The patient was put on antihypertensive medication with 190 mg metoprolol, 10 mg ramipril, 250 mg clonidine retard, 50 mg dihydralazine, 10 mg amlodipine, 8 mg doxazosin, and 50 mg triamterene with 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide.Ambulatory follow-up in 3 months revealed office blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg and recovery of all symptoms including exertional dyspnea. Echocardiography showed similar findings of LV hypertrophy (septal wall thickness of 20 mm) comparable to the initial findings.The morphological findings and clinical features of LV hypertrophy may be similar to disorders, such as HCM, amyloidosis, and hypertensive heart disease, so misdiagnosis can frequently occur. Our case demonstrates the presence of severe LV hypertrophy, small pericardial effusion, and late gadolinium enhancement by CMR, so infiltrative disease, such as cardiac amyloidosis, was suspected. However, myocardial biopsy revealed the presence of hypertensive heart disease, which could be effectively treated using a combination of antihypertensive drug therapies.Clinical presentation of patients with LV hypertrophy may differ between absence of clinical signs upon presentation and life-threatening arrhythmias or symptomatic congestive heart failure. Although the 12-lead ECG may be helpful for the identification of HCM [10], such patients might in some cases present with normal ECG. In addition, patients with amyloidosis may exhibit low total 12-lead QRS voltage despite the presence of LV hypertrophy [11].To date, several imaging methods are available for the diagnostic workup of patients with myocardial hypertrophy. Echocardiography represents the first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of LV hypertrophy, allowing the assessment of LV wall thickness, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, and LV mass. In addition, the assessment of diastolic function, myocardial strain, and strain rate by echocardiography can add incremental value for the differentiation between cardiac amyloidosis and other myocardial disorders causing LV hypertrophy [12, 13]. Despite its high practicability, however, echocardiography is an operator dependent technique, which is limited by the echogenic windows of the patients.CMR, on the other hand, exhibits higher spatial resolution than echocardiography, and its versatility allows for the assessment of ventricular thickness and mass, myocardial function (ejection fraction), perfusion, and if required myocardial deformation and viability (scar, fibrosis) by LGE within a single examination and without radiation exposure for the patients [14].A number of previous studies investigated the ability of CMR to differentiate patients with LV hypertrophy due to HCM, amyloidosis, and hypertensive heart disease. Thus, Sipola et al. [15] suggested that a maximal wall thickness of ≥17 mm could precisely differentiate patients with D175N mutation related HCM from those with hypertensive heart disease. However, in our case, this criterion would not be useful, because our patient exhibited a septal wall thickness of over 20 mm and a maximal wall thickness of 23 mm.The presence of LGE with hypertensive heart disease, on the other hand, is rated differently in the current literature. Thus, LGE was seen in 14 of 43 patients with HCM but in none of 39 patients with hypertensive heart disease [16]. In the same line, diffuse LGE was observed in 20 of 30 patients with cardiac amyloidosis, but in none of 16 patients with hypertensive heart disease [17]. In a recent European CMR study, on the other hand, 13 of 26 patients with hypertensive heart disease exhibited nonischemic, patchy LGE, predominantly in septal and inferior-lateral myocardial segments [18]. In the same line, another recent study demonstrated patchy () and midwall () nonischemic LGE in 6 of 11 patients with hypertensive heart disease, predominantly in septal and inferior regions [19]. Conversely, in our patient, diffuse LGE was suspected in the 4-chamber view and patchy LGE in the inferior and lateral LV wall. LGE is very common in patients with cardiac amyloidosis and represents interstitial expansion from amyloid deposition. Typical findings in cardiac amyloidosis include low T1 difference between the myocardium and the LV cavity and circumferential subendocardial or transmural LGE [20–23]. In our case, the LGE pattern was not typical for amyloidosis. We therefore decided to proceed with myocardial biopsy.With hypertensive heart disease, on the other hand, left ventricular hypertrophy results from chronic pressure overload due to systemic hypertension. In the absence of antihypertensive treatment, diastolic dysfunction occurs, which may lead to heart failure symptoms. During later stages of the disease, subendocardial interstitial fibrosis is increasing, compromising myocardial contractility and ultimately causing systolic LV dysfunction [24, 25]. Despite advances in the antihypertensive medications, the clinical burden of hypertensive heart disease is nonnegligible, and in some cases heart failure with preserved ejection function is present due to unchecked arterial hypertension [25]. Due to the increased rate of cardiac events with hypertensive heart disease, the early diagnosis and treatment of this disorder are crucial.Finally, from a technical point of view, T1 mapping may have further helped in differentiating between amyloidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and hypertensive heart disease in our case but was unfortunately not yet implemented with our scanner at the time of the study [20, 26].In conclusion, the diagnostic process with LV hypertrophy requires the integration of clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and if required CMR, biochemical and serological markers, and endomyocardial biopsy. Although the latest improvements with noninvasive diagnostic techniques have reduced the need for biopsy, in our case, endomyocardial biopsy excluded cardiac amyloidosis, as suspected by CMR, and revealed the presence of hypertensive heart disease.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.The authors thank Mrs. Monika Forschner, Mrs. Kristina Muend, and Mr. Dimitrios Strauss for the excellent CMR images.
A Case of Spontaneous Multivessel Coronary Artery Spasm That Underwent Stent Implantation Accompanying ST Segment Elevation on Inferior Electrocardiographic Leads
Department of Cardiology, Bezmialem Vakif University, Fatih, 34093 Istanbul,  TurkeyReceived 10 November 2015; Revised 13 April 2016; Accepted 18 April 2016Academic Editor: Magnus BaumhäkelCopyright © 2016 Nuray Kahraman Ay et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Coronary artery spasm is usually defined as a focal constriction of a coronary artery segment, which is reversible, and causes myocardial ischaemia by restricting coronary blood flow. A coronary spasm may rarely compromise all three epicardial arteries simultaneously. We present a case of severe coronary spasm afflicting all coronary arteries accompanying an ST segment elevation in leads D2-D3 and aVF.Coronary artery vasospasm is an important cause of myocardial ischaemia. Myocardial infarction can occur in severe or prolonged ischaemia. Chest pain after successful percutaneous coronary intervention constitutes a considerable problem and is potentially life threatening when myocardial ischaemia occurs. Such pain indicates the presence of residual coronary stenosis, acute occlusion, coronary spasm, or myocardial infarction. The management of each type of patient involves repeat coronary angiography and additional interventions. Coronary angiography can clearly reveal coronary artery stenosis or acute occlusion, whereas coronary spasm is difficult to demonstrate with routine angiography.A 64-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with squeezing chest pain. He was a nonsmoker with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and documented coronary artery disease. Over the preceding 8 months, he had undergone two coronary angiography procedures at another hospital. A 40% stenosis was discovered in the mid left anterior descending (LAD) artery, 90% stenosis was detected in the first diagonal and septal arteries, 40% stenosis was found in the second diagonal, 70% was found in the mid left circumflex (Cx), 98% diffuse stenosis was found in the intermediary artery, and 40% stenosis was found in the right coronary artery on the previous angiography report. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) of the Cx lesion was 0.79 and a 3.5 × 14 mm drug eluting stent was employed. Due to repeated similar complaints, angiography was performed again 5 months later at the same hospital. The angiographic results showed similar lesions but no instent stenosis. Drug therapy was administered to the patient, such as beta blocker, aspirin, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, clopidogrel, and statin. The clinical examination was unremarkable, and there was no peculiarity on the electrocardiogram (ECG) in our emergency department. Troponin I was not elevated (0.045 ng/mL). However, treatment was commenced for presumed acute coronary syndrome due to his angina and cardiac history.Two hours after admission, the chest pain recurred and the ECG exhibited evidence of an evolving ST segment elevation in the inferior leads (Figure 1). He was transferred immediately to the angiography unit for urgent angiography.We suspected a subacute stent thrombosis of the Cx artery; thus, we visualised the right coronary artery (RCA) first. We observed a 99% lesion before the crux and diffuse mild narrowing from proximal to mid segment. Diffuse significant narrowing was detected in the LAD artery and both proximal and distal to the stent in the Cx artery, but no instent stenosis was detected (Figure 2). An intracoronary nitrate injection was not considered, in accordance with known treatments for coronary artery disease. We thought that the subtotal lesion in the distal RCA was the culprit lesion, so a right guiding catheter was seated to the right coronary ostium. A guidewire was passed to the distal RCA, and 200 μg nitroglycerin was injected into the RCA to evaluate lumen diameter. The lesion was located before the crux, the narrowing proximal to the mid segment of the RCA disappeared, and the chest pain was relieved. The guidewire was removed. The left system was viewed again, and another 200 μg nitroglycerin was injected intracoronarily. A multivessel coronary artery spasm occurred, which was reversed with intracoronary glycerine trinitrate (Figure 3). No percutaneous treatments were done.Coronary artery spasm is commonly part of the spectrum of atherosclerotic coronary disease [1]. The degree of vasoconstriction during a spasm ranges from clinically undetectable to complete occlusion. Myocardial infarction may ensue in severe or prolonged cases of ischaemia. Multivessel coronary spasm very likely seems to keep a worse prognosis than single vessel spasm [1]. The appearance of coronary vasospastic segments was suitable for stenting. Correct recognition of a spasm is not always easy but percutaneous treatment can be avoided with the proper diagnosis.Coronary spasm is most often seen clinically in patients about 50 years old and decreases as age advances [2]. Female smokers suffer most frequently from coronary artery spasms [3].Multiple studies have stated that the lesions at spasm sites have less plaque, no calcification, more diffuse intimal thickening, less lipid and necrotic core, thicker baseline medial width, more prevalent negative remodelling, less thin cap fibrous atheromata, and very small baseline luminal area [4–6]. Meaningful organic coronary artery stenoses are generally low reactive to vasoactive stimuli, presumably because of stiffening of the vessel wall at points of plaque buildup and calcification [7].A recent study has pointed that the patients with variant angina have additionally not only abnormal reactivity of epicardial coronary arteries but also abnormal coronary microvascular function and peripheral arterial response to vasodilator stimuli [8].Medical therapy with calcium channel blockers and nitrates is the mainstay of treatment for coronary artery spasm. The use of beta blockers is traditionally avoided given their potential detrimental effect of limiting beta-receptor-mediated dilatation and promoting unopposed alpha adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction [3].In fact, we did not think of spasm in the patient initially, because of the coronary angiography and FFR reports that documented coronary artery disease and stent implantation in the Cx artery. However, after intracoronary nitrate injection both the right and left coronary system lesions decreased dramatically and dilatation of the coronaries was seen. With a simple intracoronary nitrate injection, unnecessary stent implantation was avoided. Quite possibly, the operators that performed the previous angiographies were not aware of this vasospasm potential in the patient. After angiography, his beta blocker therapy was changed to a calcium channel blocker and nitrate therapy was added.In patients presenting with ST elevation and no coronary obstruction, there is a high prevalence of myocarditis and thrombophilia, but, in this case, because of coronary artery history and previous hospital examinations there was no reason to think of myocarditis or thrombophilia.This case report describes an inferior ST elevation on ECG in a patient with existing coronary artery disease. A multivessel coronary artery spasm occurred on coronary angiography during his anginal attack, which emphasises the importance of excluding coronary vasospasm during diagnostic coronary angiography prior to intervention.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Thoracic Stent Graft Implantation for Aortic Coarctation with Patent Ductus Arteriosus via Retroperitoneal Iliac Approach in the Presence of Small Sized Femoral Artery

Herein, an 18-year-old woman with complex aortic coarctation and patent ductus arteriosus was successfully treated by endovascular thoracic stent graft via retroperitoneal approach. The reason for retroperitoneal iliac approach was small sized common femoral arteries which were not suitable for stent graft passage. This case is the first aortic coarctation plus patent ductus arteriosus case described in the literature which is treated by endovascular thoracic stent graft via retroperitoneal approach.Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a common congenital heart disease that accounts for 5–8% of all congenital heart defects, and it occurs as a result of congenital narrowing of the aorta, which is typically located at the insertion of the ductus arteriosus just distal to the left subclavian artery [1]. Many cases may have a loss of luminal continuity between the ascending and descending aortic segments. Previous studies reported that the progression of the luminal stenosis may cause total occlusion of CoA [2, 3]. CoA could be accompanied by patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), bicuspid aortic valve, and ventricular septal defect. Endovascular stenting is a commonly preferred intervention for CoA [4–6]. Due to the coarcted segment in the aorta, blood flow distal to the coarcted segment decreases [7]. Common femoral artery diameter increases with age and body size, and females have smaller diameter of common femoral artery as compared to males [8]. Patients with small sized common femoral artery are not suitable candidates for endovascular interventions with big sized endovascular stent grafts. This potential difficulty may contribute to trying alternative ways such as retroperitoneal (RP) or transperitoneal (TP) approach for endovascular stent grafting. The RP approach was demonstrated to be associated with lower rates of postoperative complications when compared to the TP approach [9]. Herein, we presented a case of CoA associated with PDA who was successfully treated with thoracic endovascular stent graft via retroperitoneal iliac approach.An 18-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with breathlessness and hypertension. Her medical history included arterial hypertension for one year with no history of traumatic injury or Takayasu’s arteritis. On physical examination, height was 150 cm and weight was 40 kg, pulse rate was 89 bpm with blood pressure of 162/95 mmHg in both arms, and all pulses were palpable. However, lower extremity pulses were diminished with a typical radial-to-femoral delay and systolic pressure difference between brachial and ankle was 80 mmHg. Routine blood tests and urine analysis were normal. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur could be heard along the left intercostal area and severe S1 sound was audible. The examination of the respiratory and other systems was normal. Transthoracic echocardiography examination showed increased wall thickness of left ventricle (interventricular septum 1.3 cm and posterior wall 1.3 cm), normal left ventricular ejection fraction (65%), and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure (45 mmHg). Aortic valve was bicuspid and normal functioning. The maximum peak flow velocity in the left ventricular outflow tract measured 1.6 m/s (corresponding to maximal gradient of 10.3 mmHg), indicating no significant left ventricular outflow tract gradient. An increased peak flow velocity of 3.8 m/s (corresponding to a maximal gradient of 58 mmHg) together with the typical color Doppler pattern indicated severe stenosis of the descending aorta (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The parasternal short-axis views revealed a PDA (Figure 1(c)) and pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) was calculated as 1.8. Thorax computed tomography (CT) angiography showed that diameter of aorta at the preductal level is 20 mm, 11 mm at coarcted segment, and 23 mm at the postductal level. Also the diagnosis of PDA was confirmed with thorax CT angiography (Figure 2).Percutaneous treatment of the CoA and PDA with a generally preferred balloon expandable covered stent was planned. But balloon expandable covered stents dedicated for CoA were not available at those days. For this reason, we decided to use a self-expandable thoracic stent graft. Because of their small size detected on CT angiography, common femoral arteries (3.0 mm, both) and external iliac arteries (4.0 mm, both) were not suitable for thoracic stent graft implantation. So we decided to use left common iliac artery (CIA) via RP approach which was 5.5 mm in diameter (right CIA was 5.3 mm). The procedure was performed under general anesthesia. A 6-F pigtail catheter was placed via right femoral artery to the descending aorta, but the catheter could not pass the coarcted segment (Figure 3). The coarcted segment could be crossed using 0.035-inch hydrophilic guide wire (Radifocus, Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and 5-F multipurpose diagnostic catheter (Cordis Corporation, Miami, Florida, USA). This catheter was changed with a 5-F marker pigtail catheter (Cook Inc., Bloomington, USA). Gradient across coarcted segment was measured as 85 mmHg. For retroperitoneal approach of left CIA, an incision was made in the skin of left lower quadrant of abdomen about 3 cm above from the inguinal ligament. Then, left CIA was reached and a 6-F introducer sheath was placed by Seldinger technique. Coarcted segment was passed with hydrophilic guidewire and 5-F multipurpose catheter via the sheath in left CIA. Hydrophilic guidewire was changed with extra stiff Amplatz guidewire (Amplatz Extra Stiff 0.035 inches, Boston Scientific, MA, USA). The sheath in left CIA was exchanged with a 22 Fr E-asy Plus hemostatic valved introducer sheath (Jotec GmbH, Hechingen, Germany). A 26 mm × 100 mm sized thoracic stent graft (Ankura, Lifetech Scientific Ltd., Shenzhen, China) was placed over the coarcted segment via the 22 Fr sheath (Figure 4). After confirmation of optimal position, the stent was released and then dilated with a balloon catheter (E-xpand, Jotec GmbH, Hechingen, Germany) with high atmosphere for optimal dilatation of the stenosed segment to exclude residual gradient and complete apposition of the stent (Figure 5). Control aortography confirmed that the coarcted segment is optimally dilated and the PDA is completely covered by stent graft without any leak. The measured gradient across coarcted segment after stent placement was 5 mmHg. Similar findings were confirmed by echocardiographic assessment. Also intravascular pressure difference between ascending aorta and femoral artery was 5 mmHg. The patient recovered well and was discharged three days after the procedure. Before discharge, control CT angiography showed fully expanded thoracic stent graft with complete exclusion of PDA (Figure 6). The patient was asymptomatic after two years.Simple coarctation in the absence of accompanying lesions (e.g., ventricular septal defect, mitral stenosis, and bicuspid aorta with stenosis) is the most common form in adults [7]. Complex coarctation with other defects (e.g., coarctation with PDA) is not common in young adults [10]. Our patient had complex coarctation with postductal PDA. Open surgical repair is still the gold standard therapy for totally occluded CoA, but due to significant collateralization through the intercostal arteries, these surgical patients increase the risk of bleeding complications. In addition, other early postoperative complications such as paradoxical hypertension, aortic dissection, left recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, phrenic nerve injury, and subclavian steal are still important [11]. Transcatheter closure of moderate-to-large ducts with occluder devices has been widely practiced in recent years [4]. Treatment of CoA associated with PDA depends on patient’s age, features of coarcted segment, and the size of the duct [4]. Patients with small sized common femoral artery are not suitable candidates for endovascular interventions with big sized endovascular stent grafts. In these cases, CIA can be cannulated via RP or TP approaches [12]. The TP approach was historically the most practiced way. However, the RP iliac approach advocates the significant benefits of not entering the peritoneal cavity and avoiding a long middle incision [9, 12]. Consequently, the decreased incidence of paralytic ileus and pneumonia is expected. The reduced incidence of these complications may have led to a significant decrease in the length of the hospital stay. Many studies revealed that the RP approach is superior to the TP approach in many respects [9, 13].Balloon expandable covered stents seem to be the ideal and simple percutaneous option for the cases with CoA plus PDA. Also these stents could be more suitable for this patient with small sized common femoral arteries, because the maximal sheath size for delivering these stents was 12 Fr. But these stents were not available in our hospital. Besides surgery which was refused by patient and her relatives, percutaneous PDA occlusion with duct occluder and balloon expandable bare stent dedicated for CoA or only balloon dilatation for CoA could be another option [4]. But our cardiovascular team (cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons) decided to perform thoracic stent graft in the line of thought that similar result could be obtained as balloon expandable covered stent. On the other hand, disadvantages of thoracic stent graft as compared with balloon expandable covered stent are longer stent size and need for bigger vascular access. Although occlusion of the subclavian artery and the other arteries arising from aorta is a risk with long thoracic stent grafts, in case of rupture or dissection [14], further interventions may not be needed with these stents.Middle aortic coarctation (MAC) is another rare type of CoA which is usually presented in youth or adolescence [15]. This type of coarctation comprises only 0.5–2.0% of all aortic coarctation cases [15]. MAC can cause renovascular hypertension like CoA [15], but it may be difficult to be diagnosed with transthoracic echocardiography, because of its location. Abdominal ultrasonography and abdominal CT angiography are usually the diagnostic tools for MAC. It should be suspected in patients with refractory hypertension, lower extremity claudication, and/or abdominal angina presentation [15]. Abdominal aorta was found to be normal on CT in our case.This case is the first aortic coarctation plus patent ductus arteriosus case described in the literature which is treated by endovascular thoracic stent graft via retroperitoneal approach.Thoracic stent graft can be used to treat CoA associated with PDA, but not alternative to balloon expandable covered stents. In case of need for bigger vascular access site than common femoral artery diameter, RP iliac approach is a good and safe option for endovascular interventions.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
The Artery of Percheron Infarction after Coronary Angiography
Internal Medicine Department, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430,  USAReceived 9 March 2016; Accepted 13 April 2016Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2016 Haitham Mazek et al.

However, as with any invasive procedures, there is a risk of complications. We are reporting a case of 69-year-old male with past medical history of cardiac bypass surgery, CHF, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the hospital to evaluate his chest pain. He had treadmill stress test that showed ischemic induced exercise. Patient underwent coronary angiography that showed proximal complete occlusion of the RCA with a patent graft. At the end of the procedure, the patient did not wake up and remained minimally responsive. An urgent brain MRI was ordered and showed infarctions consistent with an artery of Percheron infarction. Later, patient has improved slowly and was discharged home. We briefly here discuss this rare complication including the risk factor, clinical presentation, and the management.Coronary angiography has been and currently remains the gold standard test for identifying the presence and extent of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). This procedure is generally considered safe. However, as with any invasive procedure, there are specific patient-dependent and procedure-related complications associated with the test. One uncommon complication is stroke. We report a case of altered mental status following diagnostic coronary angiography.A 69-year-old man underwent coronary angiography for evaluation of chest pain. He had a treadmill stress test with myocardial perfusion imaging that revealed exercise-induced ischemia involving the inferior wall of the left ventricle. The patient has a history of cardiac bypass surgery, diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The angiography was done via right femoral artery using a 6-French arterial sheath. His coronary angiography showed proximal complete occlusion of the RCA with a patent graft. The procedure lasted 26 minutes during which the patient remained hemodynamically stable. During the procedure, he received 2 mg of midazolam and 1 mg of hydromorphone. At the end of the procedure, the patient did not wake up and remained minimally responsive. The patient withdrew from painful stimulation but had no spontaneous movements. One dose of naloxone 0.4 mg intravenous did not change his clinical examination. A neurology consultant reported that his pupils (left: 3 mm and right: 2 mm) were minimally reactive to light and that he had left medial rectus palsy. His reflexes were normal and there were no other focal deficits. His immediate CT scan of brain without contrast showed no acute hemorrhage or infarction. MRI of the brain confirmed bilateral medial thalamic and left midbrain infarctions consistent with an artery of Percheron infarction (Figure 1). The patient was continued on antiplatelet therapy. He did not receive TPA because of an arterial puncture at a noncompressible site within the last 7 days. The patient had slow improvement in his cognitive function. He became verbal and communicative but still not fully oriented. There was no improvement in the left third cranial nerve function; the limitation in vertical gaze movement was persistent. The patient was discharged after one week of hospitalization to a rehab center.Stroke after coronary angiography is uncommon but can be associated with substantial short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. It affects mainly elderly and high-risk patients with intraprocedural complications. Common symptoms include visual disturbance, motor weakness, aphasia, and altered mental status. Cerebral infarction following cardiac catheterization can be asymptomatic, and it occurs in about 15% of patients [1].Predisposing factors for stroke include age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary angiography performed under emergency conditions, prior stroke, renal failure, the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump, and congestive heart failure [2]. Periprocedural strokes often occur during or immediately after the procedure when the femoral artery sheath is still in place, but the diagnosis can be delayed up to 36 hours in some cases [3]. Periprocedural stroke occurs in 0.03% to 0.3% of diagnostic procedures [3] and 0.3–0.4% of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) [2]. Cerebral microembolism is the main mechanism of periprocedural ischemic stroke occurring with PCI. Air embolism, thrombus formation in the catheter or on its surface, or dislocation of aortic atheroma during manipulation and passage of catheters within the aorta are the main sources of embolic material causing ischemic stroke during cardiac catheterization or PCI [4]. Al-Mubarak et al. showed that most of the embolic strokes during catheterization procedures are associated with an embolus located in either the common carotid bifurcation or the proximal middle cerebral artery [5]. In a recent 1-year study of pericoronary angiography strokes, the occluded vessel was the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 24% of patients, the posterior cerebral artery in 19%, the basilar artery in 5%, the vertebral artery in 10%, and occlusion in 2 anterior circulation branches (MCA, anterior cerebral artery, or both) in 43% patients [6].The artery of Percheron (AOP) is a small perforating artery or arteries supplying paramedian thalamus and midbrain. The incidence of AOP infarction is very low (from 0.1 to 2%) in all ischemic strokes due to variations of paramedian thalamic-mesencephalic arterial supply [7] and 4–18% in thalamic infarction [8]. The major mechanism of AOP infarction involves embolic or lacunar disease classified in many subgroups for prognosis [9]. Patients with bilateral paramedian thalamic strokes typically have a triad of altered mental status, vertical gaze palsy, and memory impairment like our patient’s presentation. Altered mental status can present anywhere on the spectrum from drowsiness or confusion to hypersomnolence or coma. These disorders of vigilance generally occur with sudden onset and may persist until death. Some cases of complete recovery have been documented.The management of stroke requires restoration of blood flow to the affected area of the brain as quickly as possible. In the case of intraprocedural stroke, the major advantages of performing a cerebral angiogram are that the diagnosis of embolic stroke can be confirmed and treatment can be given immediately. The occurrence of postprocedural stroke requires urgent cerebral imaging (well before 4.5 hours has elapsed) [10] to confirm an ischemic cause and to plan subsequent treatment. One of exclusion criteria for use of TPA is arterial puncture at a noncompressible site within 7 days [11].Although stroke is uncommon, patients should be monitored closely throughout the procedure. In this case, endovascular therapy may have been the treatment of choice. However, recent studies did not show any benefit when compared to medical management [12]. It may be important for cardiovascular specialists to be familiar with cerebrovascular anatomy and angiographic technique to improve emergency care in patients with acute stroke.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.All authors read and approved the final paper.

A Case of Arterial and Venous Tear during Single Lead Extraction
Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Drexel University College of Medicine and Hahnemann University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA 19102,  USAReceived 15 February 2016; Revised 22 March 2016; Accepted 3 April 2016Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2016 Michael S. Green et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Transcutaneous lead extraction can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The risk of causing concomitant arterial and venous injury is rare. We report a case of marginal artery rupture with coronary sinus rupture after a CS lead extraction. A 71-year-old male was admitted for extraction of a 6-year-old implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead due to fracture from insulation break. During the lead extraction, blood pressure fell precipitously and echocardiographic findings were consistent with pericardial effusion. After unsuccessful pericardiocentesis, open chest sternotomy and evacuation of hematoma was performed. Subsequent surgical repair of several injuries was completed including the distal coronary sinus, a large degloving injury of posterior portion of the heart, and first obtuse marginal branch bleed. This case demonstrates that when performing transcutaneous lead extraction (TLE) with laser sheath, a degloving injury can cause arterial rupture with concomitant coronary sinus injury. A multidisciplinary team-based approach can ensure patient safety. Learning Objective. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads will falter over time. With the advancement of new technology for extraction more frequent and serious complications will occur. Active fixation CS leads present unique challenges. In the presence of hemodynamic changes during extraction the occurrence of both an arterial and venous injury must be considered. The use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemakers has increased significantly over the past 2 decades. These mechanical devices are subject to deterioration and malfunction. Although any component of the implantation can malfunction, the lead is the most susceptible [1]. The estimated lead survival rate at 5 years after implantation is 85% and at 8 years is 60%, reaching down to 20% at 10 years [2]. At such time, leads need to be removed through lead extraction. Leads can be extracted via a transcutaneous approach. Transcutaneous lead extraction (TLE) can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Reported major complication and mortality rates with TLE vary widely across studies. In one large study the rate of major complications in TLE was found to be 1.4% [3]. These complications range from cardiac tear, vascular avulsion, pulmonary embolism, and anesthesia related complications. These complications can require blood transfusion or surgical intervention. The leads are designed so they are advanced and fixed in the coronary venous system around the heart, so there is an unavoidable risk of causing venous injury during the traction and dislodging. However, the risk of causing arterial injury during lead extraction is rare. We report a case of marginal artery rupture along with coronary sinus rupture after an ICD lead extraction. Truly a rare occurrence was unreported in the literature.A 71-year-old male with a history of chronically implanted ICD (6 years) was initially admitted to electrophysiology (EP) suite for an ICD lead extraction and replacement upgrade of the system to a biventricular functional system. During an ICD pulse generator replacement (Medtronic Viva XT CRT-D, model DTBA1D1) 2 months earlier the coronary sinus lead was noted to have a fracture due to insulation break so it was cut and capped at that time. The model of this particular implanted Left Ventricular Coronary sinus lead was Medtronic StarFix unipolar active fixation, model 4195 (implant date 6 years ago). Patient had history significant for class III congestive heart failure with underlying LBBB.Cardiac fluoroscopy was performed to demonstrate normal position of the ICD pulse generator in the left subclavian area. The right atrial and ventricular leads tracked normally while the coronary sinus lead was noted to be fractured within the pocket with the lead remnant in the ICD pocket. Cardiac silhouette motion was normal and no evidence of pleural effusion was noted. Local anesthesia was infiltrated to the right and left groin. An 18 g arterial line was placed in the left femoral artery with good waveform. #7f and #9f venous lines were placed in the right femoral vein. Through the #9f, an intracardiac echocardiographic (ICE) probe was advanced to the level of the right atrium and ventricle. No evidence of vegetation or pericardial effusion was noted. The left subclavian area was prepped and draped. Local anesthesia was administered to the left anterior chest wall prior to opening the pocket. The pulse generator was removed from the pocket and leads were dissected to the level of the anchoring sleeves. There was a cap present over the abandoned lead remnant and this cap was removed. Tie-down sutures were removed. Leads were dissected to the level of the anchoring sleeves to free them up from posterior scar tissue. The anchoring sleeve of the coronary sinus lead was removed and gentle traction initiated; however, it was heavily scarred into position at the distal branch of the lateral branch of the coronary sinus. All 4 splines were deployed. The head of the lead was cut off and a Liberator locking stylet was advanced and locked at 1 cm from the tip of the lead. With continuous traction, a 12-French laser sheath was advanced over the lead to break up heavy fibrosis near the left brachiocephalic vein and down to the superior vena cava. The lead became dislodged situating itself at the proximal area of the coronary sinus. Continuous gentle traction of this area and laser at the ostium of the coronary sinus lead dislodged the lead in its entirety from the coronary sinus and it was removed without difficulty. There was a substantial amount of scarring at the level of the coronary sinus insertion site and around the splines before they became dislodged.At this time, the patient’s blood pressure became labile. Cardiac silhouette motion was decreased and ICE probe showed pericardial effusion consistent with pericardial tamponade. A subxiphoid pericardiocentesis needle was inserted and 60 cc of blood was aspirated. The patient’s blood pressure responded and, however, subsequently started to decrease again. Cardiothoracic surgery was called to the EP suite, and patient was intubated and requiring massive hemodynamic support, which deteriorated into cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. While in the EP suite, open chest sternotomy and evacuation of hematoma from the pericardium was performed. Large amount of clot was removed from behind the heart and hemodynamics stabilized despite continued bleeding. Patient was transferred to the operating room.Intraoperatively, the patient was immediately placed on cardiopulmonary bypass to explore cardiac structures and injury. Several injuries were noted including a large amount of bleeding from the posterior portion of the heart due to total disruption of the distal coronary sinus and large degloving injury of posterior portion of the heart with large first obtuse marginal branch bleed. In addition, the innominate vein had a large hematoma overlying a tear where it crossed the aorta. At least 2 puncture injuries to the heart were noted likely associated with pericardiocentesis.After the patient’s status stabilized, electrophysiology recommended replacement of biventricular ICD pulse generator to his remaining right atrial and ventricular leads without any further manipulation of the leads with intention to eventually upgrade to a biventricular device. The procedure was successfully completed.Most pacemaker leads implanted within a year can be removed without the use of any specialized equipment, termed “lead explant” [4]. But as the duration of the leads increases, fibrosis will form around the leads and adhere them to the vessel walls. thus requiring specialized equipment in a procedure named “lead extraction” [4]. Therefore, in patients with a chronically implanted lead, more fibrosis will form around the lead, causing the extraction procedure to be more difficult and prone to complication. The most common reasons for lead extraction are device infection and lead conduction failure. A multidisciplinary team-based approach involving a cardiothoracic surgeon, anesthesia support, access to fluoroscopy and echocardiography, and nursing support is critical in order to ensure safe outcome [4]. Operator experience is also an important component in reducing complications. A single center’s experience using a multidisciplinary approach suggests that there is a learning curve to lead extraction procedure as well as the preparation for potentially unavoidable complications [4]. Although infrequent, most of the complications attempting the extraction involved a laser sheath technique, leading to SVC tear or cardiac tamponade [5, 6]. A trend toward more complication was noted in procedures associated with a laser sheath (3.4% versus 0.8%) [6]. With an increased amount of fibrosis around the leads, a laser approach is more desired to remove the fibrotic tissue around the lead for an easier extraction. The increased incidence rate of complications using the laser sheath could be due to decreased cardiac wall stiffness after lasing with a larger sized sheath (12f–16f) [7]. A decreased wall stiffness could cause the pericardial tissue to tear more easily under the stress of extraction. In this case, avulsion of the lead caused a large degloving injury during which left marginal artery was ruptured. Left marginal artery (or obtuse marginal artery) is a branch of the circumflex artery, traveling along the left margin of heart towards the apex of the heart. Active fixation CS lead such as the Medtronic StarFix CS lead used in our case presents additional procedural complexity compared to the use of passive fixation CS lead. It almost always required the use of excimer laser sheath compared and reimplantation proved to be impossible in the same venous branch [8].Active fixations CS leads were introduced to reduce the rate of lead dislodgment, but the active fixation mechanism can present with added complications should these leads necessitate extraction. Although limited knowledge base in the literature has reported acceptable success and morbidity in extraction of active CS leads [9], there should always be an anticipation and preparation for any potential complication. Our case demonstrated that when performing a transvenous lead extraction of an active fixation CS lead, a degloving injury can cause arterial rupture and venous rupture. A multidisciplinary team-based approach can ensure patient safety when faced with complications such as a coronary sinus and arterial rupture.The authors declare that there are no competing interests.
Ventricular Septal Perforation after Biventricular Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Successfully Repaired with an Amplatzer Device: First Report in the Literature
1Cardiac Unit, Sanatorio Otamendi, Callao 1441 4B, 1024AAA Buenos Aires,  Argentina2Instituto Cardiovascular San Isidro, Las Lomas, Buenos Aires,  ArgentinaReceived 30 December 2015; Revised 27 January 2016; Accepted 31 January 2016Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2016 Alfredo E. Rodríguez et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 79-year-old female was admitted with sudden onset dyspnea, mild oppressive chest pain, and severe anxiety disorder. Patient had history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. On admission blood pressure was 160/90 and heart rate was 130 bpm. Transthoracic echocardiography (TE) and contrast tomography showed a thin septum with an abnormal left and right ventricular contraction with an “apical ballooning” pattern and mild increase of cardiac enzymes. At the 4th day of admission, the patient presented symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure and developed cardiogenic shock. EKG showed an inversion of T waves in all precordial leads. In a new TE, a ventricular septal perforation (VSP) in the apical portion of the septum was seen. Coronary angiogram showed angiographically “normal” coronary arteries. With a diagnosis of VSP in takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a percutaneous procedure to repair the VSP was performed 11 days after admission. The VSP was closed with an Amplatzer device. TE performed 24 hours after showed significant improvement of ventricular function and good apposition of the Amplatzer device. Three days later she was discharged from the hospital. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a VSP in a TCM repaired percutaneously with an occluder device.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) was characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction usually involving anteroapical and inferoapical regions of the myocardium in the absence of significant coronary artery disease in the majority of patients [1, 2].It was first considered to have a good prognosis; however, some TCM patients also developed severe cardiac complications including cardiac rupture (CR) in 0.2% [2, 3].Hereby, we are reporting a TCM patient with a ventricular septal perforation (VSP) successfully repaired with an Amplatzer occluder device and to our knowledge this is the first reported case in the literature using this percutaneous technique.A 79-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with sudden onset dyspnea, mild oppressive chest pain, severe anxiety disorder, and the use of the accessory respiratory muscles. The patient had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic atrial fibrillation under anticoagulation therapy. Physical examination showed coarse crackles in the lower two-thirds of the lungs, wheezing, tachycardia with irregular rate, and no cardiac gallop or murmurs. Blood pressure (BP) was 160/90 hpm, irregular pulse was 130, and respiratory rate was 30 per minute.On admission a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a thin septum with a large area of hypokinesia in the apical, inferior apical, lateral apical, and anterior apical segments of the anterior left ventricular wall with an apical ballooning pattern (Figures 1 and 3) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 41%.Right ventricular chambers revealed enlargement and hypokinesia (Figure 1(a), arrows) and the admission EKG showed no significant changes (Figure 2(a)). Six hours after admission cardiac enzymes were slightly increased, with a troponin of 116 μg/L (upper limit of normal was 50) and a CK-MB of 5.6 μg/L (upper limit of normal was 4.88). A cardiac tomography angiography was performed in order to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was normal, also confirming the integrity of a thin ventricular septum and the angiographic pattern of “apical ballooning” (Figure 3). In spite of the fact that after CT angiogram pulmonary embolism is discarded and the “apical ballooning” pattern suggested a presumptive diagnosis of TCM, coronary angiogram was deferred by reference physician preference and the patient was medically treated in a conservative manner.At the 4th day of admission the patient presented symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure and a new onset of harsh, loud, and holosystolic murmur radiating to the back. In the EKG an inversion of T waves in all the precordial leads was observed (Figure 2).A new TTE revealed similar compromise of the left and right apical walls of ventricles, but a VSP defect of 0.7/0.8 mm in apical portion of the septum was now observed, with the defect located 10 mm of distance from the apex of the left ventricle (Figure 1(b)). A coronary angiography was performed to assess the coronary tree. Right coronary artery was small without significant lesions and with a dominant left circumflex and left anterior descending (LAD) arteries “angiographically” normal; in the left ventriculogram, the septal defect was observed (Figure 4). The patient developed cardiogenic shock in spite of intensive medical treatment; therefore, a percutaneous procedure to close the VSP was planned.At the 11th day of admission, the VSP was successfully repaired and closed percutaneously with an Amplatzer occluder device; the procedure was attempted using both femoral artery and vein access; fluoroscopy time of the procedure was 110 minutes (Figures 5(a)–5(f)).Patient had had a significant improvement of functional class; TTE revealed recovery of right and left ventricular function (left ejection fraction, 52%) and good apposition of the Amplatzer device (Figure 1(c)).Patient was discharged from hospital three days later and remained asymptomatic in our last contact two months after admission.TCM accounted for approximately 2% of all the patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome and 90% of these were postmenopausal women [1–3].Our patient met all of major criteria for TCM: female at elderly age, extreme anxiety at admission, dyspnea, mild chest pain, slight elevation of cardiac enzymes, acute T waves changes in anterolateral leads, anterior and apical hypokinesia with hyperkinesia of basal segments, and no significant lesions in the coronary tree. Hypokinesia of the right ventricle observed on the admission TTE (Figure 1(a)) was an unusual finding but was previously reported in up to 40% of cases [5].TCM was initially associated with good prognosis; however, severe complications including CR were also described. In a recent revision, CR was found in 14 cases including left and right free wall rupture in 10 cases and VSP in 4 cases [2, 4, 6, 7]; therefore, it should not be considered as a benign entity.From these 4 cases, 2 survived after repair of the defect with conventional cardiac surgery and the other 2 died without treatment. Of interest, in such recent revision (2015), the authors did not take into consideration percutaneous technique as a potential tool to treat these patients [4]; in Table 1, we are describing treatment and outcome of these cases including ours.In all percutaneous VSP closure procedures, access through femoral artery and femoral vein is mandatory.First, a left catheterization of the left ventricle was done; the presence of an apical defect close to the apex increases the difficulty to appropriately reach the defect through left chambers and a wire guide was crossed from left to right ventricles and deployed into pulmonary artery. The guide wire was grabbed with a snare using the vein access allowing crossing the guiding catheter from right to left ventricles and the final deployment of Amplatzer device (Figure 5). The long fluoroscopy time in this case was related with the apical location of the defect in spite of the fact that most of the maneuvers to cross the defect were entirely guided by transesophageal echocardiography.The only limitation of this presentation is that one cannot totally exclude the possibility that the patient actually had a coronary event such as a coronary embolus to the LAD with spontaneous lysis prior to angiography rather than TCM. However, the mild troponin elevation and biventricular presentation make this scenario, in our opinion, less likely. We also recognized that CT is not the best tool to assess left ventricular ballooning and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) is the best test to confirm diagnosis of TCM. This will help differentiate between myocardial oedema and myocardial scarring; however, by logistic reasons, CMRI was not available at the time of the rupture, and after the device was implanted, CMRI is contraindicated during the first three months after implantation.In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case using a percutaneous approach to repair this mechanical complication in a TCM.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
A Case of Isolated Celiac Artery Dissection Accompanied by Splenic Infarction Detected by Ultrasonography in the Emergency Department
Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Kobe Tokushukai Hospital, 1-3-10 Kamitakamaru, Tarumi-ku, Kobe-shi, Hyogo 655-0017,  JapanReceived 13 January 2016; Accepted 28 March 2016Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2016 Kazumasa Emori et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension visited the emergency department (ED) by ambulance complaining of sudden pain in the left side of his back. Ultrasonography (USG) performed at ED revealed splenic infarction along with occlusion and dissection of the celiac and splenic arteries without abdominal artery dissection. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed the same result. Consequently, spontaneous isolated celiac artery dissection (SICAD) was diagnosed. Because his blood pressure was high (159/70 mmHg), antihypertensive medicine was administered (nicardipine and carvedilol). After his blood reached optimal levels (130/80 mmHg), symptoms disappeared. Follow-up USG and contrast enhanced CT performed 8 days and 4 months after onset revealed amelioration of splenic infarction and improvement of the narrowed artery. Here, we report a case of SICAD with splenic infarction presenting with severe left-sided back pain and discuss the relevance of USG in an emergency setting.Spontaneous isolated visceral artery dissection (SIVAD) is a sudden critical condition that may lead to aneurysmal formation, rupture, or arterial occlusion. SIVAD should be differentiated from visceral artery dissection (VAD) accompanied by aortic dissection. Recently, with the development of new imaging modalities, SIVAD can be diagnosed at an early stage and, if immediately treated, it can improve with conservative therapy. Here, we present a case of spontaneous isolated celiac artery dissection (SICAD) with splenic infarction presenting with severe left-sided back pain that was successfully diagnosed through ultrasonography at the emergency department.A 46-year-old male visited our emergency department complaining of sudden and severe left-sided back pain in the middle of July 2014. Costovertebral angle tenderness initially suggested a left-sided ureteral stone. His past medical history included hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had no history of catheterization. Physical examination upon arrival revealed that his blood pressure was 159/70 mmHg, heart rate was 72 beats/min with regular rhythm, blood oxygen saturation was 99% under atmospheric conditions, and body temperature was 36.6°C. Blood chemistry analyses revealed a mildly elevated white blood cell count (10,500 cells/μL), mildly elevated creatinine levels (1.07 mg/dL), and no abnormal coagulant dysfunction (80% prothrombin; 26.3 s activated partial thromboplastic time; 280 mg/dL fibrinogen; 94% haptoglobin; <5 μg/mL fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products; D-dimer <0.5 μg/mL).Electrocardiography revealed a normal, regular heart rhythm without ST changes. Chest X-ray was normal without cardiomegaly or pleural effusion. Ultrasonography (USG) ruled out the presence of hydronephrosis or ureteral stones; however, Doppler USG revealed splenic infarction. Closer examination by USG revealed celiac artery dissection (CAD) with thrombotic occlusion of the false lumen extending from the trunk of celiac artery (CA) to the distal splenic artery (SA) (Figure 1). Consequently, CAD with splenic infarction was diagnosed. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed the same result; there was no finding of intestinal ischemia or aneurysmal formation, and blood flow in the dissected artery was preserved up to the distal SA (Figure 2). Conservative therapy was initiated with antihypertensive medicine (nicardipine and carvedilol) and rest. On day 8, follow-up USG and contrast enhanced CT revealed no deterioration of dissection or formation of arterial aneurysm and amelioration of splenic infarction. Conservative therapy was continued until he was uneventfully discharged on day 12. Ambulant follow-up was continued to control hypertension. USG and contrast enhanced CT performed 4 months after onset revealed amelioration of SICAD (Figure 3).VAD is usually accompanied by abdominal aortic dissection, and spontaneous visceral VAD not associated with aortic dissection is considered a rare condition. However, with the development of new imaging modalities, cases of VAD have increased. SICAD is a significant differential diagnosis of acute abdomen whose diagnosis is challenging. Bauersfeld [1] stipulated that the histological difference between SIVAD and aortic dissection is that SIVAD occurs between the intima and the external elastic layer, whereas aortic dissection occurs between the first and second part of the intima. SIVAD etiology is male dominant (4 : 1 ratio of males to females) usually occurring between 40 and 50 years of age (average: 56 years) [2]. Risk factors of SIVAD and CAD include atherosclerotic changes, hypertension, smoking, trauma, iatrogenic conditions, infections, pregnancy, and Marfan syndrome [3]. Another cause of CAD might include compression by the median arcuate ligament, in which there is continuous friction or stress on the celiac artery each time the diaphragm descends with respiration [4]. Our case was a relatively young male with a history of hypertension and an indistinct genetic background related to the condition. A main clinical symptom of SICAD is abdominal pain. If splenic infarction accompanies SICAD, clinical symptoms could include left-sided back pain and should be differentiated from ureter stones. If SICAD involves a branch of the hepatic artery, it may cause liver ischemia, leading to higher mortality. In such cases, surgical treatment or interventional stenting is recommended [3].SICAD is sometimes accompanied by arterial aneurysm and clinical presentations include bleeding from ruptured aneurysm. Bret et al. [5] reported a case in which jaundice was caused by compression because of hepatic artery aneurysm and SICAD, which required percutaneous drainage and surgical resection of the aneurysm. Poor prognosis related to SICAD with aneurysm results from liver ischemia and bleeding of CA aneurysms and surgical treatment should be considered to treat these fatal conditions [5]. Although there was no evidence of aneurysm in our case, meticulous follow-up was needed to monitor the potential risks associated with aneurysm formation.VAD is usually diagnosed through angiography, USG, CT, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/MR angiogram (MRA). Until now, angiography has been considered the gold standard for diagnosing VAD; however, because of its invasiveness, it is being replaced by less invasive imaging modalities, such as USG, CT, and MRI/MRA [3]. With routine use of USG or CT in clinical settings to screen diseases, an increasing number of VAD without detectable symptoms have been diagnosed. It is also important to be aware of renal artery dissection in which patients present with back pain accompanied by renal infarction [6]. Whenever clinicians admit patients with back or flank pain, arterial diseases (e.g., splenic or renal infection) or SIVAD should be suspected and Doppler USG should be used.SIVAD treatment includes conservative, antihypertensive, anticoagulant, and/or antiplatelet therapy, stent placement, bypass grafting, and resection of gangrenous intestines. Moreover, SIVAD treatment is classified into acute or chronic phase. Acute phase treatment includes emergency surgery if there are symptoms of aneurysmal rupture, impending rupture, or severe intestinal ischemia. It is unclear whether anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents effectively treat SIVAD; however, in some case reports, anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents were used for long-term management [7–9]. Conversely, there are some reports in which spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection (SISMD) was successfully treated without anticoagulants [10, 11]. If decreased blood flow is caused by the development of SIVAD, thrombus formation is possible and can lead to organ ischemia. In some cases with reduced blood flow, anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy may be helpful for preventing thrombus formation. In our case, anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy was not provided regardless of whether splenic infarction resulted from SIVAD. However, splenic infarction was ameliorated by antihypertensive therapy. Thus, further research is required to determine which conditions require anticoagulant therapy. Yoon et al. [12] reported a case of SISMD that required stent replacement because of a progressively narrowed true lumen despite anticoagulant therapy. Aggressive therapy, including stent replacement or surgical treatment, is recommended in SIVAD cases, which fail to improve with conservative therapy. Even if conservative treatment is adopted in the first medical interview, meticulous follow-up is necessary because intervention is sometimes required to prevent further development of the condition. In the chronic phase, aneurysmal formation of over 20 mm or chronic intestinal ischemia, including abdominal pain after eating or weight loss, denotes candidates for surgical treatment. In our case, strict control of blood pressure without anticoagulant therapy was crucial for preventing recurrence for over 17 months after the initial presentation.We reported a case of SICAD and splenic infarction presenting with severe left-sided back pain that was successfully diagnosed by USG. At ED, abdominal aneurysm, ureteral stone, and orthopedic diseases should be the differential diagnoses of back pain, and severe back pain caused by splenic infarction resulting from SICAD should be considered. USG may be a helpful imaging modality for properly diagnosing SICAD in emergency settings.The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.Kazumasa Emori, Nobuhiro Takeuchi, and Junichi Soneda treated the patient.

Torsade de Pointes Triggered by Early Ventricular Escape Beats in a Patient with Complete Atrioventricular Block
1Department of Cardiology, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, 06010 Ankara,  Turkey2Cardiology Service, Girne Military Hospital, 99300 Girne, Northern Cyprus, Mersin 10,  TurkeyReceived 14 November 2015; Accepted 8 March 2016Academic Editor: Christopher S. SnyderCopyright © 2016 Erkan Yildirim et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Torsade de pointes is an uncommon and malignant form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and associated with a prolonged QT interval, which may be congenital or acquired. Complete atrioventricular block may cause QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes. In this paper, we present a case with complete atrioventricular block complicated with frequent episodes of torsade de pointes triggered by early premature ventricular contractions despite normal QT intervals.Syncope is a frequent symptom in patients with complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) [1]. In the majority of cases, low cardiac output caused by decreased heart rate is responsible for the symptoms. However in some cases bradycardia associated QT prolongation may lead to malign ventricular tachyarrhythmias causing syncope [1, 2]. We, herein, reported a case with CAVB complicated with frequent episodes of torsade de pointes (TdP) triggered by early premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) despite normal QT intervals.A 73-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic for fainting and syncope. She had several episodes of syncope in the last few hours. She was on oral antidiabetics for diabetes mellitus and ramipril for hypertension. Her past medical history was otherwise normal. On initial physical examination, she was bradycardic (36 bpm), but alert and fully oriented. Her blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg. The physical examination was otherwise normal. Her initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed CAVB with a rate of 38 bpm and with frequent PVCs (Figure 1). Her blood chemistry was normal. Bedside echocardiogram revealed no structural heart disease. While being monitored in the coronary intensive care unit she suddenly developed TdP leading to syncope which required DC cardioversion for termination (Figure 2). She had several other episodes of sustained and nonsustained TdP until transvenous temporary pacemaker was in effect. All TdP episodes were triggered by an early PVC which hit the descending portion of the T wave on ECG (Figure 3). Increasing the heart rate by temporary cardiac pacing completely abolished the PVCs and TdP episodes. Coronary angiogram showed noncritical atherosclerotic plaques and ventricular tachycardia (VT) was not induced with electrophysiology study. The patient was further treated with a dual permanent pacemaker. The 6-month follow-up was uneventful.The term TdP refers to a VT characterized by QRS complexes of changing amplitude that appear to twist around the isoelectric line and occur at rates of 200 to 250/min. TdP during bradyarrhythmias has been reported to be associated with gender, degree of QT prolongation and duration of bradyarrhythmia. Between 5% and 30% of patients with CAVB have been reported to develop TdP [1]. Although many predisposing factors have been cited for TdP, the most common causes are congenital syndromes, severe bradycardia, potassium depletion, and use of medication such as class IA, IC, or III antiarrhythmic drugs [1, 2].In patients with bradycardia-induced TdP, a number of ECG parameters during bradycardia are correlated with increased risk of TdP including QT interval, T wave morphology, and T peak to T end (Tp-Te) [2, 3]. Although ECG parameters can be reasonable predictors of TdP in bradyarrhythmias, there are limited data on cellular or genetic mechanisms of bradycardia-induced TdP [4, 5].CAVB may lead to downregulation of potassium channels, QT interval prolongation, and TdP [6]. However, QTc and serum potassium levels were within normal limits in this case. Genetic factors and female gender might have an important role as risk factors for this patient. In addition, electrocardiogram showed us VPCs in which R waves superimposed on T waves as “R-on-T” phenomenon (Figure 3). We believed that these early beats were triggering TdP. The “R-on-T” phenomenon was first described by Smirk in 1949. He described the early beats as precursors for ventricular fibrillation and sudden death [7].Fries et al. [8] reported the incidence of “R-on-T” phenomenon in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators. The study showed that 15% of VPCs initiated VT. Of the VPCs that led to VT, 16% occurred on the ascending limb, 23% on top, and 61% on the descending limb of the T wave. VPCs leading to TdP were more likely to occur on the descending limb of the preceding T wave as seen in our case (Figure 3) [8].In conclusion, acquired CAVB may sometimes induce TdP and the episodes of TdP result in syncope, cardiac arrest, and even death due to degeneration into ventricular fibrillation. PVCs especially “R-on-T” phenomenon should alert physicians as precursors for ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Early recognition and implantation of cardiac pacemaker can be lifesaving. Meanwhile all attempts should be made for findings of any underlying causes.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Tirofiban-Induced Thrombocytopenia Occurring with Crohn’s Disease
1Department of Cardiology, Bekaa Hospital, Zahle,  Lebanon2Department of Hematology, Hôtel-Dieu de France University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Saint Joseph University, Beirut,  LebanonReceived 5 March 2016; Accepted 24 March 2016Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2016 Toni Ibrahim et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.A 69-year-old man, with severe refractory Crohn’s disease, presented with acute coronary syndrome that required angioplasty. He developed severe tirofiban-induced thrombocytopenia (TIT) heralded by type I allergic reaction that required steroids and a combination of antihistamine H1 and antihistamine H2 for symptomatic management. The thrombocytopenia spontaneously resolved uneventfully in 48 hours thereafter. This case report suggests a possible association between TIT and inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, strict monitoring of the platelet count is required in patients who develop allergic reactions to tirofiban.Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) receptor is a platelet surface protein that leads to platelet aggregation via cross-linking of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Therefore, it has been considered as a primary target for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and used as an adjunct to coronary interventions [1]. Although thrombocytopenia occurring with the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors has been described in only 2% of patients, it constitutes a major safety concern with poor prognosis and high rates of mortality [2]. The pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in this setting is not yet fully clear with various clinical presentations concerning its time of onset and severity [3]. Herein, we report the case of an early severe tirofiban-induced thrombocytopenia (TIT) heralded by type I allergic reaction.A 69-year-old man without previous medical history except for a refractory Crohn’s disease was referred to the Cardiology Department for the management of an acute coronary syndrome. His labs were normal except for an increased level of cardiac biomarkers. The patient received aspirin 100 mg PO and enoxaparin 30 mg IV before undergoing an urgent coronary angiogram. The angiogram revealed 95% stenosis of a dominant marginal branch requiring stenting. The patient therefore received enoxaparin 25 mg IV, ticagrelor 180 mg PO, and tirofiban 34 mcg/Kg/min followed by 0.1 mcg/kg/min over 24 hours. The rest of the angioplasty was uneventful. One day later, the patient complained of palpitations, dyspnea, chills, and minor urticaria. The patient was symptomatically treated with methylprednisolone 60 mg IV STAT and was started on desloratadine 5 mg PO q12h and ranitidine 150 mg IV q12h. One day later, the patient complained of repetitive episodes of rectal bleeding. The blood exam was only relevant for severe thrombocytopenia at 2000/mm3 with normal peripheral blood smear. The patient received two pools of platelets at 12 hours apart. Tirofiban, ticagrelor, enoxaparin, and aspirin were stopped. Two days later, the platelet count increased to 47000/mm3. The patient was discharged three days later with normal hematologic test results.Since Andreas Gruntziq first introduced coronary angioplasty in 1977, clinicians have been driven to lower the risks of stent thrombosis and introduced anticoagulants and antiaggregants to their procedures. Clinical studies have proved a significant benefit for these adjunctions but with a relatively acceptable risk of bleeding and thrombocytopenia [4]. In the particular case of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, the platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptor is inhibited and thus fibrinogen binding and platelet/platelet aggregation are blocked. The pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia associated with the use of GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors may be described as acute and severe (<50.000 platelets/mm3) within 12 hours of exposure, acute within 12 hours of second exposure, severe or not 5 to 7 days after any type of exposure, and pseudothrombocytopenia [5]. However, it is often possible to find more than one etiology responsible for thrombocytopenia including acute, idiosyncratic, and delayed immune-mediated mechanisms especially with the concomitant use of heparin, ticagrelor, and aspirin [3].Overall, drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) is a form of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) that occurs 5 to 14 days after initiation of a new drug (commonly quinine or antibiotics). This delay is equivalent to the time for the patient to become sensitized to the drug and to constitute antibodies against his platelets [6]. In contrast, TIT is nearly always caused by naturally occurring drug-dependent antibodies within minutes to hours after the first exposure to the drug. Interestingly, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor-induced thrombocytopenia is similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) time pattern occurring within 1–4 hours or 7–14 days [7]. In general, DITP is a clinical diagnosis mainly based on the patient’s history of recent drug initiation and the resolution of thrombocytopenia upon drug withdrawal. Testing for drug-dependent anti-platelet antibodies may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. However, thrombocytopenia may only be recognized days thereafter when bleeding occurs as in our case.The comparison of the incidence of thrombocytopenia across the different GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors has been recently reported in one meta-analysis of 29 large placebo-controlled randomized trials [2]. Overall, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, administered PO or IV, increase the rate of thrombocytopenia (RR = 1.62; 95% CI 1.48–1.78) and severe thrombocytopenia (RR = 3.52; 95% CI 2.87–4.30). Subgroup analysis demonstrated an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with abciximab (RR = 2.93; 95% CI 2.43–3.52) and tirofiban (RR = 2.79; 95% CI 1.17–6.63) only. Eptifibatide did not show any statistically significant increase in the risk of thrombocytopenia (RR = 1.05; 95% CI 0.86–1.29).Our patient developed thrombocytopenia during the first 24 hours after his presentation to the hospital. The variations in the kinetics of the platelet count upon withdrawal of all antiaggregants seem to relate to TIT even though aspirin, ticagrelor, and enoxaparin are plausible etiologies for thrombocytopenia. Effectively, our patient being naïve to heparin would have developed HIT after five days. Moreover, aspirin and ticagrelor were never reported to cause such severe thrombocytopenia.The time pattern of the TIT of our patient suggests the presence of naturally occurring antibodies that would destroy platelets coated with IIb/IIIa antagonists. Tirofiban may act as an antigen or may expose a platelet epitope that would be recognized by specific antibodies [8]. Our patient’s thrombocytopenia was preceded by nonspecific allergic symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea, chills, and minor urticaria. Such reaction confirms the immune-related etiology of TIT. Our patient had refractory Crohn’s disease which hypothetically increases the exposure of the humor immune system to colonic antigens which increases the formation of anti-GP IIb/IIIa antibodies [9]. The exposure of our patient to tirofiban, in the presence of anti-GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, induced an allergic reaction that heralded the occurrence of thrombocytopenia. Therefore, we recommend monitoring of platelet counts in the subgroup of patients with autoimmune disease, particular inflammatory bowel disease, in case of tirofiban administration. These patients may benefit from prophylactic measures before administering GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors to prevent severe thrombocytopenia. Moreover, strict monitoring is required in patients who develop allergic reaction to tirofiban.A written consent has been signed by the patient.The authors declare that they have no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Eosinophilic Myocarditis due to Toxocariasis: Not a Rare Cause

From the perspective of treatment strategy, eosinophilic myocarditis should be distinguished from other types of myocarditis. Toxocariasis, caused by Toxocara canis or Toxocara cati, is known as a cause of eosinophilic myocarditis but is considered rare. As it is an unpopular disease, eosinophilic myocarditis due to toxocariasis may be underdiagnosed. We experienced two cases of eosinophilic myocarditis due to toxocariasis from different geographical areas in quick succession between 2013 and 2014. Case 1 is 32-year-old man. Case 2 is 66-year-old woman. In both cases, diagnosis was done by endomyocardial biopsy and IgG-ELISA against Toxocara excretory-secretory antigen. Only a corticosteroid was used in Case  1, whereas a corticosteroid and albendazole were used in Case  2 as induction therapy. Both patients recovered. Albendazole was also used in Case  1 to prevent recurrence after induction therapy. Eosinophilic myocarditis by toxocariasis may in actuality not be a rare disease, and corticosteroid is an effective drug as induction therapy even before use of albendazole. Myocarditis is a serious clinical situation that is considered rare as it is found in only 0.1% of pathological autopsies [1]. However, it has a high mortality rate (38–54%) [2]. It is important to distinguish subtypes of this diagnosis in order to better understand the role of corticosteroids or other therapies that may be effective in treating myocarditis.Eosinophilic myocarditis comprises 6% of all types of myocarditis [3], and most cases of eosinophilic myocarditis are described as idiopathic. The frequency of other causes of eosinophilic myocarditis is not well understood, and there are only 14 reports of eosinophilic myocarditis due to toxocariasis, caused by Toxocara canis (T. canis) or Toxocara cati (T. cati) [4].We experienced two cases of eosinophilic myocarditis due to toxocariasis from different geographical areas between 2013 and 2014, which suggests that the actual frequency of eosinophilic myocarditis due to toxocariasis has been underestimated. The reports presented here indicate that it may be helpful to use corticosteroids as induction therapy for eosinophilic myocarditis due to toxocariasis.Case  1. The first case was a 32-year-old Japanese man who lived in Tianjin, China, for business. His job was in sales for motor parts. Upon returning to Japan, he went to a hospital for chest discomfort and dyspnea following exercise in December 2013. He had ulcerative colitis and the activity was controlled without medication. His last recurrence of ulcerative colitis was unknown. He had no history of allergy and no pets.The initial examination showed the following findings: blood pressure of 122/68 mmHg and heart rate of 83 beats/min without cardiac gallop rhythm.Laboratory examination on admission revealed an increase in the total white blood cell count (12,540/μL), especially due to an increase in the eosinophil count (2,880/μL) and elevated enzymes: creatinine phosphokinase (CK) of 303 IU/L and Troponin-I of 1.863 ng/mL. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an abnormal Q wave in III and aVR leads and a negative T wave in II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 leads. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed cardiac dilation. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed thickening of the left ventricular (LV) wall; in particular, intraventricular wall thickness was 11-12 mm, with global hypokinesis. There was no significant valvular dysfunction and pericardial effusion. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a focal deficit in the myocardium but no deficit in the pulmonary artery. Coronary angiography (CAG) was normal. Endomyocardial biopsy showed eosinophil invasion into the myocardium (Figure 1(a)). Although not intense, the degranulated eosinophil infiltration with few other inflammatory cells indicated that there was significant active eosinophilic inflammation. As a whole, we diagnosed this as eosinophilic myocarditis. A high dose of corticosteroid, prednisolone (PSL) 1 mg/kg/day, was used orally as induction therapy. After using PSL, the eosinophilia disappeared within several days and his cardiac symptoms, CK, LV wall thickening, and ejection fraction recovered in parallel (Figure 2(a)). During this period, ECG and TTE changed variously, and cardiac dilation disappeared in CXR. Hemodynamics were maintained consistently. Later, we suspected parasite infection because of unknown cause of eosinophilic myocarditis. We examined a commercial multiple-dot ELISA kit (SRL, Tokyo, Japan) as a screening test; anti-IgG to T. canis was detected in his serum. For further study to confirm the diagnosis, we performed IgG-ELISA to Toxocara excretory-secretory antigen (TES-IgG-ELISA) at the Department of Parasitology, Miyazaki Medical University (Miyazaki, Japan). The TES-IgG-ELISA consisted of the following: wells of microtiter plates were coated with 10 μg/mL of T. canis larval excretory-secretory antigen and intubated with diluted samples (1 : 900–1 : 2,700). Binding of antibodies to T. canis antigen was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG and optical densities were read with a microplate reader. We detected TES-IgG-ELISA in his serum. We did not examine T. canis larval excretory-secretory antigen with Western blotting. Taken together, the patient’s background, high prevalence of Toxocara spp. in China, clinical data, especially eosinophilia, and high presence of T. canis antibody led to our diagnosis of myocarditis by toxocariasis. Although he was almost free of cardiac symptoms, we added an anthelmintic, albendazole (600 mg/day orally), to his treatment regimen from day 44. For two months after induction therapy, physical examination, laboratory tests, and ECG showed normal findings. He subsequently returned to China. Subsequent course was unknown.Case  2. This second case was a 66-year-old Japanese woman living in Nagoya, Japan, who had never been abroad. She had a fever of unknown origin, chronic diarrhea, elevated biliary enzyme, and eosinophilia for a month in June 2014. We suspected various differential diagnosis such as the following because of fever of unknown origin with eosinophilia; allergy, drug side effect, HIV infection, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and so forth. She did not have allergic disorders and other new drugs. We also ruled out other diseases serologically, including HIV infection and chronic eosinophilic leukemia and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. We suspected parasite infection because she was a cook and often used vegetables from an open-field culture. We examined a commercial multiple-dot ELISA kit (SRL, Tokyo, Japan) as a screening test. Because anti-IgG to T. canis was positive, we performed TES-IgG-ELISA at the Department of Parasitology, Miyazaki Medical University (Miyazaki, Japan). TES-IgG-ELISA was also positive in her serum. Taken together, our diagnosis was visceral larva migrans due to toxocariasis. We planned to use an anthelmintic, albendazole, in a few days. Six weeks later from disease onset, before using albendazole, in August 2014, she was admitted to the hospital for chest discomfort and presyncope. She had chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, persistent atrial fibrillation, and chronic heart failure.The initial examination showed blood pressure of 100/75 mmHg, and she had a third heart sound. Laboratory data on admission revealed an increase in the total white blood cell count (9,700/μL), along with a high eosinophil count (4,510/μL). She also had elevated enzymes: CK of 433 IU/L and Troponin-T of 6.31 ng/mL. ECG showed a complete right bundle branch block that had not been seen before. CXR showed cardiac dilation. TTE showed that the LV wall was hyperechoic and thickening; in particular, intraventricular wall thickness was 17 mm. CAG was not done because of the CKD 5 stage; however, endomyocardial biopsy was done. Endomyocardial biopsy showed eosinophil invasion to the myocardium; some eosinophils were degranulated (Figure 1(b)). Our diagnosis was eosinophilic myocarditis due to toxocariasis. Both prednisolone (PSL, 1 mg/kg/day orally) and albendazole (600 mg/day orally) were used as induction therapy. Eosinophilia disappeared within several days and her cardiac symptoms, CK, and LV wall thickening recovered in parallel (Figure 2(b)). After the induction therapy, ECG and TTE changed variously and cardiac dilation improved slightly; however, it remained in CXR. Hemodynamics were stable consistently. We used albendazole for 4 weeks and decreased PSL gradually with 5 mg PSL as a maintenance dose. She did not have recurrence after 4 months from onset.These two cases of eosinophilic myocarditis were caused by toxocariasis. This report shows two clinically important observations. First, toxocariasis is often overlooked as a cause of eosinophilic myocarditis; therefore, the frequency of reports on toxocariasis causing this disease may be inaccurate. Second, corticosteroids may be a key drug for treating eosinophilic myocarditis even when caused by toxocariasis.Myocarditis is serious because it may cause acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and arrhythmia. Although it is found at only 0.1% in pathological autopsies [1], the actual mortality rate is quite high (38–54%) [2]. Myocarditis is divided into four subtypes according to pathological findings: lymphocytic, giant cell, eosinophilic, and granulomatous. Eosinophilic myocarditis comprises 6% of all types of myocarditis [3]. In addition, eosinophilic myocarditis may often be caused by another background disease which is idiopathic or vasculitis, neoplasms, parasites, and drugs [5]. It is important to clinically distinguish eosinophilic myocarditis from other types of myocarditis to offer the most effective therapy.Toxocariasis may be overseen as a cause of eosinophilic myocarditis. One report shows that 30% of eosinophilic myocarditis is idiopathic. On the other hand, visceral larva migrans caused by all types of parasites represents only 15% of eosinophilic myocarditis [6]. However, it is possible that toxocariasis is misdiagnosed and the cause of eosinophilic myocarditis is diagnosed as idiopathic. One reason for misdiagnosis is that Toxocara spp. infection itself in humans is almost always asymptomatic. Toxocara spp. affect dogs (T. canis) and cats (T. cati), which excrete invective ova in their feces. Human can be infected by ingesting embryonated Toxocara eggs from vegetables contaminated by the infected dog or cat feces or by eating undercooked meat from paratenic hosts. The eggs hatch and larvae penetrate the intestinal wall, reaching the liver through the portal vein. Toxocara spp. can also reach other organs like the heart through systemic circulation. The frequency of T. canis infection in adult dogs is 4.3% in Japan [7]. However, Toxocara spp. infection in adult humans is increasing with the recent increase in pets. In fact, antibodies against Toxocara spp. are confirmed in 1–6% of healthy Japanese people [8] and 13% of healthy Chinese people [9]. Toxocara spp. infection sometimes occurs, but many physicians may not be familiar with it; therefore, it is a neglected parasitic infection [10]. Incidentally, we cannot distinguish between T. canis and T. cati by TES-IgG-ELISA or Western blot due to antibody cross-reactivity [11, 12]. In addition, toxocariasis may lead to eosinophilic myocarditis to a greater extent than we imagine. In a laboratory experiment of mice, 10–15% of mice infected by T. canis developed eosinophilic myocarditis [10]. We reported on two cases that occurred within a two-year period in different geographical areas. This suggests that the current reported frequency of eosinophilic myocarditis caused by T. canis infection may be lower than actual situation.Corticosteroids rather than albendazole may be an effective treatment for eosinophilic myocarditis caused by toxocariasis in acute-phase treatment. In Case  1, use of only the corticosteroid without albendazole achieved remission. Previous experiments on animals also show that corticosteroids, rather than albendazole, seem to be effective for the following reason. In mice diagnosed with eosinophilic myocarditis due to T. canis, the inhibition of eosinophil invasion to myocardium prevented myocardial damage or myocardial fibrosis without clearing T. canis [13]. This report shows that eosinophilia itself rather than Toxocara spp. invasion to myocardium is essential in eosinophilic myocarditis, and, in this sense, eosinophil suppression is significant for acute-phase treatment. Possibly, albendazole may contribute as chronic-phase treatment to prevent eosinophilia or eosinophilic myocarditis.More case reports are needed to accurately capture the frequency of eosinophilic myocarditis and its appropriate treatment for both acute-phase treatment and chronic-phase treatment to prevent relapse. Patients should be tested for Toxocara spp. infection properly in order to establish the connection between this infection and eosinophilic myocarditis.The two cases presented here suggest that toxocariasis is often overlooked as a cause of eosinophilic myocarditis. Therefore, clinicians should check TES-IgG-ELISA when eosinophilic myocarditis is suspected. In addition, a corticosteroid may be a key drug for treating eosinophilic myocarditis due to toxocariasis in the acute phase even before use of albendazole.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Special thanks are due to Dr. Haruhiko Maruyama and the Department of Parasitology, Miyazaki University, for measuring TES-IgG-ELISA.
Synthetic Marijuana Induced Acute Nonischemic Left Ventricular Dysfunction
Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Coney Island Hospital, Brooklyn, NY 11235,  USAReceived 21 January 2016; Revised 8 March 2016; Accepted 16 March 2016Academic Editor: Magnus BaumhäkelCopyright © 2016 Moustafa Elsheshtawy et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Synthetic marijuana is an uptrending designer drug currently widely spread in the US. We report a case of acute deterioration of nonischemic left ventricular dysfunction after exposure to synthetic marijuana. This case illustrates the importance of history taking in cardiac patients and identifies a negative cardiovascular effect of synthetic marijuana known as K2, not yet well detected by urine toxicology screening tools.Synthetic cannabinoids (marijuana), also known as K2, were first reported in the US in 2008. Synthetic cannabinoids exert their potent effect on the myocardium either via interacting with different receptors or through excess catecholamine release. Deployed impact can lead to major cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and fatal arrhythmias. As of today, routine toxicology screening tests used to detect synthetic marijuana are not available in most hospitals. Development of an appropriate drug screen to detect synthetic cannabinoids is complicated by the compound variability in drug combinations. This suggests that healthcare providers who exclude drug-induced toxicities based on a negative drug screen result will continue to underestimate the impact of synthetic marijuana on health.A 50-year-old man came to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and choking sensation. Symptoms started a few minutes after smoking a synthetic marijuana joint. The patient also stated that he has been coughing with yellow mucus sometimes tinged with blood streaks for five days prior to presentation. However, he denied any chest pain, diaphoresis, or dizziness.Patient’s past medical history was significant for mild systolic dysfunction, hypertension, and residual right sided hemiparesis and rigidity following motor vehicle accident many years ago. He denies any history of heart attacks in the past and was never diagnosed with atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease. The patient stated that he has been smoking one pack of cigarettes a day for 35 years and admitted to smoking natural marijuana for recreation occasionally. The patient stated that, on the day of presentation, he tried to smoke a synthetic marijuana joint for the first time. The patient was prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor by his primary doctor, but it was unclear whether he was on any beta-blockers.Vital signs on admission were stable except for an elevated heart rate ranging between 100 and 110 beats per minute. Physical exams demonstrated bilateral rales mainly basal and more on the right side. Mild expiratory rhonchi were also noted on both lung fields. Laboratory findings were significant for elevated pronatriuretic peptide (5207 pg/ml) and mild leukocytosis (17.7 K/μl). Other laboratory tests including thyroid function tests, three sets of cardiac enzymes, and screening urine toxicology were all normal.ECG on admission showed sinus tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), left atrial enlargement, and left ventricular hypertrophy with prolonged QTc (488 msec). ST and T wave nonspecific changes were also noted on the lateral leads of ECG (Figure 1).Chest X-ray revealed pulmonary venous congestion associated with bilateral pleural effusions. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast was diagnostic of cardiogenic pulmonary edema and the patient was admitted for management of congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient was started on diuretics and antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia. An echocardiogram showed severely reduced left ventricular function with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10–15% associated with global hypokinesis (Figure 2(a)) compared to an EF of 32% reported by the patient’s private cardiologist a month before admission. The patient showed improvement clinically and radiologically after two days of treatment and was restarted on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and beta-blocker medications. Coronary catheter angiogram did not reveal any coronary vessel blockade (Figure 3) and the patient received life vest upon discharge. A follow-up echocardiogram recorded 2 months later revealed stable reduced left ventricular function with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10–15% as previously noted (Figure 2(b)).Synthetic marijuana is a chemically unrelated analog of the natural cannabinoid, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active principle of cannabis [1]. Up to 7000 cases of synthetic marijuana intoxication are reported in the US annually [2]. Members of the “Spice” family are up to 800 times more potent agonists than THC. They act mainly on the two types of cannabinoid receptors (CB), with type 1 mainly present in the CNS causing the psychoactive state. Most synthetic cannabinoids, whether smoked or infused orally, do not show cross-reactivity to THC or its metabolites and are not detected on antibody-based drug test assays like rapid urine drug screens [1].Tachycardia is the most common symptom reported from synthetic marijuana intoxication [2]. Animal and in vitro studies varied in establishing cannabis’ effect on the myocardium either through brain centers or via exerting a direct effect on the vascular tone.Marijuana was shown to augment left ventricular function and increase heart rate through excessive catecholamine release for few hours after exposure [3]. THC was shown to increase cardiac output by up to 30% and heart rate by 20–100% in a dose-dependent way with consequent reduction in left ventricular ejection time [3, 4]. THC can also facilitate atrioventricular node conduction and decrease peripheral vascular resistance [3]. These observed effects increase the oxygen demand of the myocardium and can trigger myocardial infarction and have been linked to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in some cases [4, 5]. In a large epidemiologic study, marijuana was found to increase myocardial infarction 4.8-fold in the first 1 hour following marijuana use compared to periods of nonuse (95% confidence interval: 2.4–9.5, ) [5].In one study, endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) inhibited the function of voltage-dependent sodium (Na+) and L-type calcium (Ca2+) channels in rat ventricular myocytes independent of CB1 and CB2 receptor activation [6]. CB1 receptor activation resulted in a negative chronotropic effect and decreased force of isolated heart contractions. Observed effect was less pronounced in vitro than in vivo and was independent of the autonomic nervous system [7].In our case, we report a sudden acute deterioration of left ventricular function following exposure to synthetic marijuana. Establishing this connection is based on history given by the patient and after ruling out ischemic heart disease as a possible cause. Our patient did not show any signs of myocardial ischemic changes and coronary angiogram was normal. Since it is expected that the ejection fraction would have partially recovered after two months if the synthetic cannabinoid was the only reason to blame, it is also unclear if this patient ever stopped abusing the substance. Linking K2 abuse solely to the myocardium depression in our case has been a challenge especially in the absence of urine toxicology test quantifying the substance level. However, establishing the relationship between K2 and its negative sequelae on the myocardium will require further studies to conclude such effects. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in adults of acute nonischemic left ventricular dysfunction after exposure to synthetic marijuana. This case identifies a negative cardiovascular effect of synthetic marijuana known as “Spice.”The authors declare that they do not have competing interests.All authors listed have contributed sufficiently to the project to be included as authors, and all those who are qualified to be authors are listed in the author byline.
Solid Right Ventricular Compression by Intraventricular Septum-Hematoma Induced after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
1First Department of Medicine, University Medical Centre Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer 1-3, 68167 Mannheim,  Germany2German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Mannheim, Mannheim,  Germany3Department of Clinical Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University Medical Centre Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer 1-3, 68167 Mannheim,  GermanyReceived 11 October 2015; Accepted 18 February 2016Academic Editor: Yoshiro NaitoCopyright © 2016 Ibrahim El-Battrawy et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Intraventricular septum-hematoma is a rare complication following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This complication may represent a challenge for accurate diagnosis and treatment. This case report is about a 60-year-old male patient being admitted with an acute coronary syndrome. Despite successful PCI with drug eluting stent implantation into the right coronary artery (RCA) the patient complained about recurrent angina pectoris according to Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class IV. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a massive  cm sized end-diastolic septum-hematoma, which compromised right ventricular cavity. Emergent recoronary angiography ruled out further contrast extravasation from the RCA. Conservative treatment was intended after discussion in the “heart-team.” The patient completely recovered with nearly complete resolution of the hematoma after 6 months.Intraventricular septum-hematoma is a rare life-threatening sequela, usually associated with myocardial infarction, chest trauma, and complication of percutaneous coronary intervention [1–3]. It can also occur spontaneously [4, 5]. Intraventricular septum-hematoma may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. No systematic review regarding management of this complication is available.We report the case of a 60-year-old male patient, who was hospitalized with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in a referral hospital and transferred to our facility for acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Coronary angiography over the right radial approach revealed a severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease with diffuse moderate stenosis of left anterior-descendens (LAD), ramus circumflexus (LCX), and long 90% diameter stenosis within the prestented right coronary artery (RCA), which was determined as the culprit lesion (Figure 1). PCI was complicated by the long calcified lesion and a restricted backup despite using an Amplatz I (AL1) 6F guiding catheter over the radial access. The initial placed Runthrough guide wire (Terumo®) was subsequently changed to a 300 cm stiff wire (Iron Man, Abbott Vascular®) along with a 1.5/12 mm Mini Trek® over-the-wire balloon (Abbott Vascular) to improve PCI-support. Four drug eluting stents (DES, Promus Element 3.5/24 mm, Promus Element 3.0/38 mm, Promus Element 3.0/16 mm, and Promus Element 2.75/38 mm; Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) were overlapped implanted after predilatation. The angiographic result was acceptable (Figure 2) and the patient free of complaints. However, final angiogram revealed a little coronary perforation in a small end-branch (diameter < 1 mm) of the ramus interventricularis posterior (RIVP, see Video-File 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/6218723) of the RCA with prompt washout of the contrast-medium without intramyocardial staining. Additional echocardiographic exclusion of pericardial effusion was performed. Therefore, the finding was interpreted as an iatrogenic intracavitary fistula, and a conservative management without specific intervention was determined.Because of increased transient ST-elevation in the anteroseptal leads V2–V5 (Figure 3) and recurrent angina pectoris second-look angiography was performed one hour after the index procedure, which confirmed the final result of index procedure in the RCA and spasm of the medial LAD with resolution after intracoronary administration of 0.2 μg nitroglycerin with accompanying ST-resolution and chest pain regression. 24 hours later patient complained of chest pain again. Emergency echocardiography (Figure 4) showed a huge swelling of the intraventricular septal wall with compression of the right ventricle and congestion in the hepatic veins, but no pericardial effusion. An intraventricular septum-hematoma was suspected and coronary angiogram ruled out persistent contrast streaming from the RCA potentially through compression of the crux cordis by the septum mass. Initial ACT was 236 seconds at index PCI and 5000E ProAmatine were administered at the second-look angiography. Initial perforation was not recognized during index PCI. Computer tomography (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), for better evaluation of myocardial tissue with regard to vitality, confirmed solid ( cm end-diastolic; Figures 5 and 6(a)) intraventricular septum-hematoma with obliteration of the right ventricular cavity. Left ventricular function was moderately deceased (EF = 42%). Conservative treatment was intended after discussion in the “heart-team” due to the hemodynamic stable situations regardless of subtotal compression of right ventricle. The surgeons were restrictive due to the pathology of the septum being not consistent enough resulting in limited possibility for resection and suture, and the patient was monitored for eight weeks with initial heart failure symptoms NYHA III and slow advance after initiation of a heart failure therapy including diuretics. Due to potential arrhythmogenic effects of the hematoma and decreased ventricular ejection fraction patient was provided with a life vest (LifeVest® Zoll-Lifecor, Pittsburgh, USA).Fortunately, follow-up echocardiography as well as CMR after one month, Figure 6(b), and two months and six months, Figure 6(c), presented a nearly complete resolution of the hematoma and decreasing obliteration of the right ventricular cavity. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 42% to 47%. Nevertheless late enhancement technique revealed a septal myocardial scar. Congestive heart failure state improved from NYHA III to NYHA I, and heart failure therapy and life-vest-protection were determined.This case report demonstrates a severe unexpected complication of initial assumed small coronary perforation, which was treated conservatively. Due to the large number [6] of inapparent coronary perforations during PCI, it is questionable if such small perforations justify routine balloon blockage of the proximal vessel or injection of prothrombotic agents for example air, thrombin, and adrenaline until perforation is fixed. The main potential risks of such maneuvers were ischemia in further myocardial segments and thrombus formation in the recently implanted coronary stents.Nevertheless a possible reason of persistent or recurrent angina after successful coronary revascularization could be intramyocardial bleeding. Therefore, a dedicated echocardiography beyond the routine work-up with ECG and cardiac enzymes should be performed routinely in patients with recurrent angina after PCI.Development of intramyocardial hematoma is a very a rare complication after PCI [3, 4]. No systematic review regarding management of this complication is available. On the other hand, spontaneous remission has been reported in a few cases [4, 5]. This complication may present a diagnostic and treatment challenge. Echocardiography, CT, and CMR are helpful. The possible reason for this complication in the presented case might be the stiff coronary guide wire despite the floppy tip.In conclusion, we suggest that a conservative approach of intramyocardial hematoma is the therapeutic approach of choice in patients who are clinically and hemodynamically stable. Close follow-up and monitoring in the intensive care unit are necessary.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Treatment of Iatrogenic Aortocoronary Arteriovenous Fistula with Coronary Covered Stent
Department of Cardiology, Ankara Numune Education and Research Hospital,  TurkeyReceived 19 January 2016; Accepted 20 March 2016Academic Editor: Kenei ShimadaCopyright © 2016 Ender Ornek et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.An 83-year-old man, who underwent coronary artery bypass operation of left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) artery, with sequential saphenous vein to the first and second obtuse marginal (OM) branches of circumflex artery 5 years ago and coronary artery stent implantation to right coronary artery 2 months ago, was admitted to the hospital with syncope and chest pain. Aortosaphenous graft selective angiography revealed that first sequential side to side ligation was inadvertently anastomosed to left posterolateral coronary vein with resultant flow into the coronary sinus and distal end to side sequential anastomosis to OM 2 coronary artery which was filling very weakly. In order to close this iatrogenic coronary arteriovenous fistula and to supply saphenous vein flow to OM artery, we decided to implant a graft covered stent into the saphenous vein at the same session.Iatrogenic aortocoronary arteriovenous fistula resulting from placement of an arterial graft to a cardiac vein is a very rare complication of coronary artery bypass graft operation [1, 2]. Most patients present postoperatively with angina as a result of residual ischemia that is due to either an unbypassed artery or a coronary steal syndrome [3]. We present a case involving grafting of the saphenous to the left posterolateral coronary vein and a new technique to closure fistula with covered stent implantation into saphenous vein graft.An 83-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with syncope and chest pain. His medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery bypass graft operation LIMA to LAD with sequential saphenous vein graft to first and second OM branches of circumflex artery 5 years ago, and coronary artery stent implantation to right coronary artery 2 months ago. On physical examination, blood pressure was 130/60 mmHg and heart rate was 60 beats/minute. A grade 2/6 mesocardiac continuous murmur was heard. Serum troponin I levels were normal. Twelve lead-ECG detected normal sinus rhythm and 0.4 seconds PR prolongation. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated biatrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Because of the ongoing chest pain, a coronary angiography was performed. LAD artery was occluded after the first diagonal branch; LIMA to LAD was patent. There was a mild stenosis at the midportion of right coronary artery and a stent at the crux was patent. Circumflex artery was diffusely diseased. Aortosaphenous vein graft selective angiography revealed that the first sequential side to side ligation was inadvertently anastomosed to left posterolateral coronary vein with resultant flow into the coronary sinus and distal end to side sequential anastomosis to OM 2 coronary artery which was filling very weakly (Figure 1(a)). In order to close this iatrogenic coronary arteriovenous fistula and to supply saphenous vein graft flow to OM artery, we decided to implant a covered stent into the saphenous vein graft at the same session. A 4.0 × 9 mm covered stent (Abbott) was implanted at the fistula side. Control angiography showed incomplete occlusion of the fistula. Afterwards a second 4.0 × 13 mm covered stent (Abbott) was implanted inside the first stent (Figure 1(b)). At last, fistula was totally occluded and a TIMI 3 flow from saphenous vein graft to OM artery was observed (Figure 1(c)). On physical examination, cardiac murmur disappeared. Because of the extremely long PR prolongation and syncope, we implanted a DDD-R pacemaker. The patient was discharged with good recovery.Inadvertently, anastomosis of the coronary artery bypass grafts to coronary veins is seen rarely [4]. Only a total of 37 case reports have been recorded. The reasons of this complication may be anatomical distortion due to myocardial scarring, pericardial fibrosis, or previous coronary bypass operations. Also pericardial fat may disturb coronary exploration [5–7]. This iatrogenic coronary arteriovenous fistula may result in myocardial ischemia, infective endocarditis, severe systemic to pulmonary shunt, heart failure with high cardiac output, and fistula rupture [8]. Previous case reports revealed that this iatrogenic situation was treated with either redo coronary artery bypass grafting, balloon or coil embolization, stenting of the ungrafted artery, or covered stent implantation in the cardiac vein [9–11]. Spontaneously, closure of the asymptomatic fistula was documented in 2 cases [12]. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time in literature, we present treatment of iatrogenic coronary arteriovenous fistula with covered stent implantation to saphenous vein graft. It is easier and practical to implant ad hoc covered stent in the coronary artery compared to that in the cardiac vein during coronary angiography procedure. It is known that high restenosis rate is a disadvantage of covered stents. However, in this case, restenosis may consolidate the closure of fistula and probable myocardial ischemia due to the fact that restenosis can be managed with a repeat intervention although the myocardial perfusion area of this graft is not so significant. We suggest that this method has considerable advantages compared to redo bypass surgery because of its less invasive nature, and, in comparison with coil embolization, it does not have a risk of coil immigration.Herein, we reported an aortocoronary arteriovenous fistula by deployment of intracoronary covered stent with a simple and safe method compared to other treatment options.The authors have no conflict of interests to declare.
18F-FDG-PET Scanning Confirmed Infected Intracardiac Device-Leads with Abiotrophia defectiva

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Abiotrophia species are relatively slow growing pathogens, which may be present as commensal flora. However, invasive infections are frequently reported, like endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and many other types of infection. In this case report we describe a 65-year-old male patient with an intracardiac device- (ICD-) lead infection caused by Abiotrophia defectiva. Diagnosis was confirmed by 18F-FDG-PET scanning. This is remarkable, since Abiotrophia defectiva is a slow growing pathogen causing low-grade infections. This case demonstrates that although infection of ICD-leads cannot be excluded in case of 18F-FDG-PET-negative findings, positive findings are highly suggestive for infection.Abiotrophia species are nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS), with high similarity to Granulicatella spp. Abiotrophia defectiva is the only species in the genus. It may be difficult to distinguish subtypes of Abiotrophia and Granulicatella spp. by standard biochemical tests for clinical microbiological laboratories; therefore they are frequently reported as Abiotrophia or Granulicatella species. It is a relatively slow growing pathogen compared to other streptococci; therefore cultivation and identification can be challenging [1].Abiotrophia species may be present as commensal flora of the oral cavity and the urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts [1]. Invasive infections are frequently reported in literature, for example, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis, endocarditis, endovascular graft infection, osteomyelitis, pyogenic discitis, septic arthritis, spontaneous brain abscess, and ocular infections [1–5]. In this case report, we present a rare infection caused by Abiotrophia species, namely, a patient with 18F-FDG-PET scanning that confirmed infected ICD-leads with Abiotrophia species.A 65-year-old male was referred to the outpatient clinic Internal Medicine in February 2013 with complaints of pain and stiffness of his neck since three months. He reported two episodes of chills without fever. He had no weight loss, night sweats, traumatic injury, pain, or stiffness elsewhere in his body. His medical history revealed systolic and diastolic heart failure with a gated pool ejection fraction of 26%, for which he received cardiac resynchronization therapy with an intracardiac device (CRTD) (type: Sorin Paradym 8750) in July 2010. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities, explicitly no fever, cardiac murmurs, or skin abnormalities. Laboratory investigations showed a raised C-reactive protein of 68 mg/L (normal range: <10 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate >95 mm/H (normal range: <15 mm/hour), and leukocytes of 9.3 × 109/L (normal range: <10 × 109/L). A spondylodiscitis was considered; however there was no evidence for spondylodiscitis on a CT-scan of the cervical spine or bone scintigraphy. Blood cultures were taken and 10 out of 14 turned positive for Abiotrophia defectiva, confirmed with mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Treatment with high dose intravenous penicillin (12 million units/24 hrs) was started. An intravascular focus, for example, endocarditis, was suspected. Duke’s criteria for infective endocarditis were not met; transesophageal echography of the heart revealed no vegetations on the cardiac valves or leads of the ICD. 18F-FDG-PET scanning demonstrated pathologic activity by the tip of both ICD-leads and at a right palatal tonsil (Figure 1). Removal of the ICD-leads was impossible due to extensive fibrosis caused by the infection. Treatment with high dose intravenous penicillin was continued for six weeks and the patient was additionally treated with clindamycin (600 milligrams three times/24 hrs) orally for six weeks. The ear-nose-throat specialist found no abnormalities on physical examination. The initial neck complaints disappeared after physical therapy. The infected ICD-leads could be the result of bacteriemia due to infection elsewhere; a potential dental focus was found. Two months after discontinuation of antibiotic therapy, laboratory findings did not indicate infection, and repeated 18F-FDG-PET scanning three months later showed no pathological activity: neither at the tips of the ICD-leads, nor elsewhere in the body.To our knowledge, only one suspected case of infected ICD and/or ICD-leads by Granulicatella spp. is reported in literature, with no confirmation by 18F-FDG-PET scanning nor removal of the ICD [4]. Infected ICDs coincide with a high mortality, up to 17% [6]. Infection may occur even >20 years after implantation and may be challenging to diagnose [7]. In case of signs and symptoms of infection, for example, fever, local symptoms, or positive blood cultures, echocardiography may indicate infection of intracardiac located parts of an ICD. However, infection of the extracardiac portion may be overlooked [8]. Vegetations on leads or ICDs can be suspected on CT-scan, but these findings are subtle and nonspecific and may represent thrombus or artifacts caused by metal parts. It is suggested that 18F-FDG-PET scanning is a promising and helpful tool in diagnosing an infected ICD and ICD-leads. Multiple patients with 18F-FDG-PET positive infected devices or leads caused by other species are reported with a sensitivity varying from 24 to 100% and a specificity varying from 79 to 100% [9, 10]. However, diagnosing infected ICD-leads by 18F-FDG-PET scanning is not free from pitfalls [9]. False positivity may be caused by mechanical rubbing of devices against thoracic muscles, leading to mild inflammation. Secondly, the size of the vegetations on the leads may be too small for detection by 18F-FDG-PET scanning, potentially causing false negative results [9]. However, specificity is high and, in case of pathological uptake around leads, infection is very likely [9].In conclusion, we report the first 18F-FDG-PET positive intracardiac device lead infection caused by Abiotrophia defectiva, demonstrating that 18F-FDG-PET is a useful, noninvasive tool for detection and follow-up of infected ICD-leads. Although infection of ICD-leads cannot be excluded in case of 18F-FDG-PET-negative findings, positive findings are highly suggestive for infection. Even though Abiotrophia defectiva grows relatively slow, 18F-FDG-PET findings were positive. This demonstrates that 18F-FDG-PET may also be helpful for diagnosing low-grade infections of ICD-leads.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Inappropriately, primary cardiac angiosarcoma is often missed as a preliminary diagnosis because of its scarcity. We present a 29-year-old previously healthy man with complete heart block and pericardial effusion who was finally diagnosed with angiosarcoma of the right atrium with extension to SVC and IVC.A 29-year-old man, with no remarkable past medical history, presented to our emergency unit with chief complaint of weakness and class III functional dyspnea 2 weeks earlier.He had no chest pain, cold sweat, or episode of syncope. He was alert and hemodynamically stable, with blood pressure of 110/80, heart rate of 48, respiratory rate of 20, and temperature of 37.2°C and oxygen saturation of 92% in the ambient air.On physical examination, heart sounds obviously diminished; however, he had no significant pulsus paradoxus. The remainder of his examination was not notable.His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed complete heart block with a ventricular rate of 52 and no ST segment or T changes.A comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed ejection fraction (EF): 55%, mild tricuspid regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) of 40 mmHg, a large echogenic mass () in the right atrium which extended toward atrioventricular junction and septal leaflet of tricuspid valve, and moderate pericardial effusion (13 mm) around LV, RV, and RA with no tamponade physiology (Figure 1(a)).Following TTE findings, transesophageal echocardiography was done which revealed a large homogenous lobulated mass in the right atrium with attachment to interatrial septum and extension to superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and AV junction (maximum size: ); he underwent spiral CT-scan of the chest with and without IV contrast which showed an infiltrative mass lesion involving the right lateral and posterior walls of the right atrium and also interatrial septum with extension to the upper part of interventricular septum. In addition, the most upper part of IVC in suprahepatic and the most distal part of SVC were involved but not obstructed (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)).Due to exacerbation of his dyspnea and increasing of pericardial effusion, he underwent therapeutic pericardiocentesis. The pericardial fluid was relatively clear and serous.Cytology of the pericardial fluid was negative for malignancy; also, smear and culture of the pericardial fluid were negative for any infection including tuberculosis.According to consultation with cardiac surgery department, a mass excision surgery was planned for him.He underwent open heart surgery but due to extension and invasion of the tumor to the RA, SVC, and IVC, excision was not possible and only surgical tissue biopsy was taken. The result of the tissue biopsy was angiosarcoma. Spiral CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed no metastasis.We referred him to oncology service for starting chemotherapy after all.Primary cardiac neoplasms are particularly unusual. Angiosarcoma is the most frequently seen histological subtype and is described by its infiltrating and damaging nature. Inappropriately, primary cardiac angiosarcoma is often missed as a preliminary diagnosis because of its scarcity [1–3].The most common complaint of the patients is dyspnea; this indiscriminate symptomatology contributes to the trouble in diagnosing such circumstances. More precise clinical findings are typically apparent later in the progression of the disease and dependent on the degree of infiltration within the heart walls [3, 4].Early diagnosis of primary cardiac angiosarcoma remains challenging. Echocardiography is the cornerstone of assessing cardiac tumors. Transesophageal echocardiography has 97% sensitivity in identifying cardiac masses [5].The prognosis for primary cardiac angiosarcoma is not good, with mean survival of  months without surgical resection; however, it was suggested that tumor size and the extent of regional expansion of the tumor were correlated with time of survival [4, 6, 7].Therapy is not uniform and the precise benefit of adjunctive chemotherapy and/or radiation is not still definite. The challenges of therapy include the infrequency of this disease, the usually progressive stage at diagnosis, and its aggressive course [7, 8].We presented a young male with pericardial effusion and complete heart block finally diagnosed as primary cardiac angiosarcoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case of primary angiosarcoma with this relatively rapid course and clinical presentation that involved both SVC and IVC.This case underscores the importance of the echocardiography as a suitable imaging modality for detecting cardiac tumors including cardiac angiosarcoma and emphasizes the importance of primary cardiac tumor in differential diagnosis of manifestations including complete heart block and pericardial effusion. This is particularly essential for general cardiologists and emergency unit clinicians to be familiar with these uncommon circumstances.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Spontaneous, Postpartum Coronary Artery Dissection and Cardiogenic Shock with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Assisted Recovery in a 30-Year-Old Patient
1Department of Anesthesiology, Mayo Clinic, 5777 E. Mayo Boulevard, Phoenix, AZ 85054,  USA2Department of Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 5777 E.

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Coronary artery dissection is an infrequent cause of acute coronary syndrome in the general population. There is, however, a greater incidence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) in young women, especially in the peripartum period. However, the majority of cases have favorable outcomes with medical management or percutaneous coronary intervention; coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and transplantation are utilized in severe cases. This case is a one of a 30-year-old postpartum female with multivessel SCAD requiring CABG with subsequent biventricular failure and inability to wean from bypass. We believe this is the first reported case in which venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was used in the management of biventricular heart failure in a postpartum patient with SCAD.Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is typically encountered in patients with a history of coronary atherosclerosis or associated risk factors; spontaneous coronary artery dissection has also been described as a rare but identifiable cause of this disease process. Overall, the incidence of SCAD has been reported to be between 0.28 and 1.1% in the general population. Young women encompass up to 70% of these cases, 30% of which are in the peripartum period [1]. Dissection occurs with separation of arterial layers leading to development of a false lumen resulting in impaired blood flow.Coronary artery dissection can be categorized as either primary or secondary in nature, with secondary dissections typically being iatrogenic and trauma related [2]. The etiology of primary (spontaneous) dissection is likely related to hormonal, hemodynamic, and autoimmune changes, most of which are encountered frequently in the pregnant patient [1, 3]. As noted by Shahzad et al., the upregulation of eosinophils related to alterations in estrogen and progesterone levels may lead to deposition of eosinophils and subsequent degranulation in the adventitia of coronary arteries propagating dissection [1]. The association with increased coronary artery eosinophilic deposition was also described by Borczuk et al. who studied autopsy reports of peripartum patients who had suffered SCAD [4].Management options for this conditions range from conservative, medical management to invasive interventions, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and even cardiac transplantation [5]. Most reports cite the left anterior descending artery as the initial site of dissection in 60% of cases with recurrent disease being uncommon if initial management was appropriate [1, 3]. A total of 162 case reports were published between 1952 and 2012 on peripartum spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), the majority of which had favorable outcomes with conservative medical management or percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement [5]. CABG is reserved for severe cases as is placement of mechanical assist devices as a potential bridge to transplantation [6]. In this case report we describe a young female patient who had severe, recurrent, multivessel spontaneous coronary artery dissection initially managed with cardiac catheterization and drug-eluting stent placement followed by emergent CABG at an outside institution and suffered intraoperative biventricular cardiac failure requiring VA-ECMO support secondary to failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass.A 30-year-old critically ill female with past medical history significant for tobacco use presented to our institution from an outside hospital after failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after a two-vessel CABG for management of spontaneous coronary artery dissection. She initially presented nine days after an uncomplicated cesarean delivery to the outside facility with complaints of chest pain. Work-up at that time revealed an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and the patient was emergently taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for left heart catheterization (LHC). She was found to have dissection of the Right Coronary Artery (RCA) and left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Multiple drug-eluting stents were placed and she was discharged home on aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol. The patient presented again 7 days later with complaints of recurrent chest pain. Repeat LHC revealed a large dissection from the mid left main (LM) to the ostial circumflex (LCX) arteries with patency of the prior stented vessels. At that time she was taken for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) of saphenous vein to LAD and saphenous vein to circumflex.The intraoperative course was relatively uncomplicated until it was evident that she could not be weaned from CPB despite maximum vasopressor and inotropic support. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) demonstrated severe biventricular dysfunction. Subsequently, our institution was consulted to convert the patient to central VA-ECMO. This was completed via the preexisting aortic and a two-stage right atrial cannula placed for CPB. She was maintained on multiple inotropic agents and transported by the team to our facility for a higher level of care. An attempt to transition to peripherally cannulated VA-ECMO via the right femoral artery and vein was unsuccessful secondary to severely limited flow related to grossly visible dissection in the proximal common femoral artery. This defect was immediately addressed with the assistance of the vascular surgeon who reestablished antegrade flow with Fogarty thrombectomy and repaired the arteriotomy site utilizing a vein patch. These interventions resulted in restoration of excellent forward flow. It was thought that this incident was likely iatrogenic given the small nature of the peripheral arteries in combination with their underlying propensity for dissection.During this operative course, repeat TEE revealed that the patient had a large previously unrecognized atrial septal defect (ASD) in the fossa ovalis which was believed to have intermittent bidirectional flow, measuring 1.5 cm. This was subsequently repaired via an open approach while that patient was on CPB. It was also confirmed by the surgeon using a flow probe that there was interval development of significant thrombosis within the newly placed saphenous vein graft (SVG) to left anterior descending (LAD) artery. It was decided that no operative intervention would be taken to correct this issue and the patient was transported to the ICU in stable condition on VA-ECMO with an open chest through persistent aortic cannula and newly placed R femoral vein cannula.Repeat TEE on postoperative day 1 showed persistent postbypass left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 25%, global hypokinesis, normal RV size, and mild-to-moderate RV dysfunction. Repeat cardiac catheterization was performed via left common femoral artery to evaluate the possible etiology of her continued dysfunction and new drug-eluting stents (DES) were placed in the native LAD, left main (LM), and the SVG (see Figures 1–3).She was successfully decannulated four days after VA-ECMO was initiated, at which time TEE revealed improved right ventricular systolic function and LV ejection fraction of 45–50%. Postoperatively, she remained in the ICU with an open chest, on inhaled nitric oxide, epinephrine, and vasopressin. The patient underwent sternal closure on day two status after VA-ECMO decannulation and was ultimately weaned off of inotropes/vasopressors and underwent mechanical ventilation 7 days after VA-ECMO removal. Further work-up into the etiology of her coronary artery dissection failed to reveal any rheumatologic component to her disease. Histopathologic staining was not performed on the operative specimens previously sent to pathology as the rheumatologist did not feel that there was a concern for autoimmune connective tissue disease given that markers including ANA, antiphospholipid antibody, and lupus anticoagulant were negative.A final transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed improved left ventricular ejection fraction of 48% with mild-to-moderate decrease in the right ventricular systolic function and moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation. The patient was discharged home on hospital day 19 in stable condition. The patient had scheduled follow-up one month after discharge at which time her physical exam showed no overt clinical signs of heart failure. She had self-reported improved exercise tolerance and was instructed to begin phase two cardiac rehab. She was also advised to continue with her current medication regimen of aspirin, Plavix, Coreg, lisinopril, and warfarin. Her case was discussed one last time at the multidisciplinary cardiac transplant selection committee meeting, where she was deemed medically too well to be listed for cardiac transplantation.Weaning a patient from CPB can be a challenging process especially in the setting of emergent cardiac surgery. The causes for difficulty to wean from CPB are numerous and delineating the exact mechanism may be difficult. The majority of difficult to wean situations can be explained by one of the mechanisms described by Licker et al. in their clinical review of weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass after cardiac surgery. Firstly, hypovolemia in the setting of preserved cardiac output and ventricular function may frequently be the cause of the difficult to wean situation. This should be excluded with TEE evaluation and volume resuscitations. Secondly, according to the authors, it is not uncommon to encounter cardiac structural or dynamic abnormalities as the causative factor. This would include valvular/prosthetic leaks, graft occlusions, and outflow tract obstruction, to name a few. Also described in their review is the importance of vasoplegic syndrome (preserved ventricular function in the setting of low systemic vascular resistance) as a cause of hypotension and inability to separate from the bypass circuit.Lastly, the cause of difficulty to wean in this case is ventricular dysfunction [7]. Causes of post-CPB ventricular dysfunction are typically multifactorial including surgical tissue trauma, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injuries, downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, coronary embolization (air, atheroma, etc.), activation of inflammatory and coagulation cascades, uncorrected preexisting cardiac disease, and myocardial stunning. There are also patient specific abnormalities that may precipitate a more severe form of dysfunction than initially predicted. With this patient, it is safe to postulate that her multiple unrecognized cardiac structural issues, in combination with factors related to her multiple, prolonged sessions of CPB, were the cause of her severe biventricular dysfunction. Although there are a variety of strategies which may be utilized to successfully separate a patient from CPB (including the use of vasopressors, inotropic agents, and volume resuscitation), in the end, what was beneficial in this case was a mechanical support device in the form of VA-ECMO, more thorough evaluation of her underlying structural defects (ASD repair, repeat LHC with stent placement), and the tincture of time.ECMO has a variety of uses ranging from the management of patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome to postcardiac surgery patient with significant global hypokinesis. In either instance, the main indications for ECMO support are to maintain right ventricular and/or pulmonary function [8]. Vanzetto et al. evaluated the outcomes of ECMO for life support in low cardiac output states after major coronary surgery and suggested that it is an acceptable modality for temporary circulatory support for the stunned myocardium [6].While the use of VA-ECMO in this report seems to be unique, there have been many reports which describe the utility of ECMO in caring for peripartum patients. For example, Hansen et al. published a case report in 2012 describing the use of ECMO in a postpartum patient who developed severe, acute mitral regurgitation related to a ruptured posteromedial papillary muscle [9]. Earlier in 2011, Weinberg et al. utilized ECMO in the management of a peripartum patient with massive pulmonary embolism [10]. These examples show the important role that ECMO has played in the management of peripartum patient with significant cardiopulmonary disease. ECMO is being used far more aggressively worldwide in young and otherwise healthy patients with potentially reversible conditions.Our case report appears to be the first published use of VA-ECMO in a postpartum patient with SCAD requiring emergent on pump CABG who was unable to be weaned from CPB. SCAD has been described in numerous case reports over the years as a potential cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the peripartum patient. Multiple papers have discussed possible management options for SCAD in the peripartum period; however, currently, there are no guidelines for the management of this specific disease process.This data was previously presented at the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting as a medically challenging case.The authors declare that they have no competing interests or industry relationships to disclose and that they have been adherent to all ethical standards set forth by Mayo Clinic, Arizona.
Carcinoid Syndrome-Induced Ventricular Tachycardia

Box 80215, Jeddah 21589,  Saudi Arabia3Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84132,  USAReceived 30 November 2015; Accepted 23 February 2016Academic Editor: Manabu ShirotaniCopyright © 2016 Austin B. Rupp et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Introduction. Carcinoid tumors are rare neuroendocrine malignancies that secrete multiple bioactive substances. These bioactive substances are responsible for the carcinoid syndrome characterized by diarrhea, flushing, syncope, and right-sided valvular heart disease. Previous case reports have described carcinoid syndrome associated with coronary vasospasm and the well-characterized carcinoid heart disease. Case. Our patient is a 73-year-old female with complex past medical history most notable for metastatic carcinoid tumors diagnosed in 2013-05. She initially presented in 2014-09 with syncope and dizziness associated with sinus pause on an event monitor. She received a pacemaker given normal left ventricular function and was discharged. However, she was readmitted with similar symptoms corresponding to multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia. She was started on high-dose beta blockade and has had no recurrence of arrhythmia over a follow-up period of 12 months. Conclusion. We hypothesize that the patient’s ventricular tachycardia was mediated by the multiple bioactive substances secreted by her carcinoid tumors. Her carcinoid tumor biomarkers were elevated and other explanations for arrhythmia were investigated and ruled out. To our knowledge, this is the first case of ventricular tachycardia mediated by carcinoid syndrome and suppressed by beta-blocker. Further investigation into this relationship is needed.Carcinoid tumors are rare neuroendocrine malignancies that arise from neural crest cells and release a variety of bioactive substances, of which serotonin, histamine, tachykinins, kallikrein, and prostaglandins are thought to be the most prominent. These vasoactive hormones are responsible for the well-described carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by cutaneous flushing, bronchospasm, diarrhea, and right-sided cardiac disease. Once carcinoid tumors metastasize to the liver or outside the gastrointestinal tract, these vasoactive substances are no longer metabolized by the liver and can cause the classic symptoms of carcinoid syndrome [1]. The usual cardiac manifestations of carcinoid syndrome are well described and include tricuspid and pulmonary valve disease leading to right-sided cardiac dilatation and ultimately right-sided heart failure. The development of carcinoid heart disease occurs in about 50% of patients with carcinoid syndrome and is associated with a poor prognosis [2, 3]. Several case reports have also shown serotonin-related coronary artery vasospasm associated with carcinoid syndrome [4–6]. There is also one reported case of carcinoid syndrome causing ventricular tachycardia in a canine subject [7]. Here, we report a case of ventricular tachycardia presumptively mediated by carcinoid syndrome.Our patient is a 73-year-old white female with complicated past medical history including breast cancer for which she underwent lumpectomy and chemotherapy in 2008, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis, and ophthalmologic disease s/p left prosthetic eye placement. She was also diagnosed with metastatic carcinoid tumor after presenting with persistent palpitations, syncope, light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain in 2013-01. Following exploratory laparotomy with small bowel resection and biopsy of the liver (positive for metastatic carcinoid tumor) in 2013-05, she was noted to have nonsustained atrial fibrillation, for which she established care with a cardiologist. She underwent left and right heart catheterization in 2013-07 that showed no coronary artery disease and minimally elevated pulmonary artery pressure (mean 31 mm Hg) and PCWP (16 mm Hg). An echocardiogram was also performed which showed hyperdynamic left ventricular (LV) function with EF 71%, mild-moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), and apical LV hypokinesis. MRI in 2013-08 showed normal EF and wall motion and absence of fibrosis or scar. Echo was repeated in 2014-02, which again showed normal left ventricular function. She continued to complain of syncopal events and ambulatory monitoring did not show any coinciding arrhythmia, although there were sinus pauses, generally occurring after octreotide injections. Octreotide was switched to lanreotide, and she did experience improvement in her syncopal episodes. Given her recurrent syncope and sinus pauses, the patient had a dual chamber pacemaker placed on 2014-09-09 that was complicated by a carcinoid crisis despite being on an octreotide drip. Her course was relatively uncomplicated following this event, and she was discharged on 2014-09-11.Unfortunately, our patient was readmitted on 2014-09-15 after being found unresponsive at home. She was taken to an outside hospital where she was intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and transferred to our facility. After extubation and upon further questioning, she endorsed two episodes of palpitations and syncope on day prior to admission for which she was given octreotide injections that relieved her symptoms. On the morning of admission, she was lying down and reading a book when she felt similar symptoms with light-headedness, palpitations, and shortness of breath. She called her daughter who found her unresponsive and cyanotic. Emergency personnel were called and she was taken to the hospital. On arrival at our institution she was sedated, and her physical exam was significant for the presence of an endotracheal tube. Cardiopulmonary examination was normal. Laboratory work-up was significant for chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, troponin of 0.17, and hypoalbuminemia. Creatinine, magnesium, thyroid stimulating hormone, and corrected calcium were all within normal limits (or had been checked within the month preceding admission and were within normal limits). Chest radiograph showed moderate pulmonary edema and head CT was negative for acute intracranial processes. Electrocardiogram was significant for a chronic left bundle branch block (QRS 128 msec), normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and QTc of 500 milliseconds. The patient was initially treated with antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia and further work-up was pursued. Shortly after admission, the patient was extubated and had no complaints other than dysphonia and sore throat. She denied chest pain following extubation and in association with her presentation. Further work-up was significant for downtrending troponins and negative infectious work-up. Echocardiogram on 2015-09-16 was significant for LVEF 70%. She was also found to have elevated levels of plasma metanephrines and urinary 5-HIAA, increased from previous studies. Most notably, pacemaker interrogation revealed four episodes of ventricular tachycardia. The ventricular tachycardia episodes evolved over 8-9 seconds with a ventricular rate of approximately 200 beats per minute and then spontaneously terminated (Figure 1). The episodes correlated with the patient’s syncopal symptoms. As aforementioned, she was extubated, antibiotics were stopped after negative infectious work-up, and consultation with endocrinology and oncology was obtained. We feel that her ventricular tachycardia was due to carcinoid crisis with excessive secretion of multiple bioactive substances, as the episodes were brief and had decreasing cycle lengths pointing to an automatic focus. After discussion with her and her family, ICD implantation was not pursued and she was started on high-dose beta blockade with metoprolol (25 mg every six hours and uptitrated to 200 mg daily by mouth). The high-dose metoprolol adequately suppressed her ventricular tachycardia and she has not had any further recurrences over a follow-up period of approximately 12 months.Here, we present the case of a 73-year-old female with a complex past medical history most notable for metastatic carcinoid tumors and carcinoid syndrome. She presented with syncope and was found to have multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia that correlated with her syncopal episodes. Work-up did not reveal any cause for the ventricular tachycardia, and we hypothesize that carcinoid syndrome caused her arrhythmia. She did not have any evidence of ischemia, significant electrolyte abnormality, or advancing structural cardiac disease. She did have conduction abnormalities (rare atrial fibrillation, LBBB, and sinus pauses) previously, but these were not significantly changed from previous and would not account for her syncopal symptoms. Additionally, her QTc was 500 msec when she was admitted with episodes of syncope. However, this was essentially unchanged from prior measurements and when corrected for the presence of LBBB was calculated at 438 msec [8]. While QT prolongation and octreotide potentially predisposed her to arrhythmia, we believe her carcinoid syndrome was the inciting event. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that markers of her carcinoid syndrome (urinary 5-HIAA and plasma metanephrines) were increased from previous levels.Presumptively, episodes of carcinoid crises caused increased production of typical vasoactive substances, leading to sympathetic overactivation, increased cardiac myocyte excitability, and ventricular tachycardia. Treatment with metoprolol negated this sympathetic activation and suppressed the arrhythmia. She has not had any recurrences of ventricular tachycardia since initiation of metoprolol. She does continue to experience symptoms of carcinoid crises with wheezing, flushing, dizziness, and dyspnea but has not had VT on pacemaker interrogations.To our knowledge, this is the first reported instance of carcinoid syndrome associated with ventricular tachycardia without evidence of myocardial ischemia or typical carcinoid heart disease. We believe this potential association is important to acknowledge, as ventricular tachycardia is a life-threatening arrhythmia that requires prompt intervention. Further exploration of associations between carcinoid tumors, their vasoactive products, sympathetic activation, and arrhythmia, particularly ventricular tachycardia, is necessary to better define these relationships and mechanisms.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
New Stenting Technique to Achieve Favorable Jailing Configuration on Side Branch Ostium: Bent Stent Technique
Department of Cardiology, Yamaguchi Grand Medical Center, 77 Ohsaki, Hofu, Yamaguchi 747-8511,  JapanReceived 29 January 2016; Revised 1 March 2016; Accepted 7 March 2016Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2016 Fumiaki Nakao. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.According to data from stent-enhanced three-dimensional optical coherence tomography, incomplete stent apposition after side branch dilation in coronary bifurcation stenting can be reduced by the free carina type (no links bridged from a carina) and by distal cell rewiring. This is the first report to describe a bent stent technique that was devised to achieve the free carina type (no links bridged from a carina), as a favorable jailing configuration.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a coronary bifurcation disease comprises 15–20% of all PCI procedures [1, 2]. A single stent technique, with stent implantation on only the main vessel crossing over a side branch (SB), is generally recommended [3]. Jailing struts or residual struts in front of an SB ostium after inadequate SB dilation may lead to adverse effects with regard to SB blood flow [4, 5]. According to data from stent-enhanced three-dimensional optical coherence tomography (3D-OCT), incomplete stent apposition after kissing balloon dilation (KBD) is reduced by the free carina type (no links bridged from a carina) and by distal cell rewiring [6]. However, it may be impossible to control the position of a link. The bent stent technique described in this report was devised to achieve the free carina type as a favorable jailing configuration.A 3.5 × 18 mm two-link Biolimus-eluting stent (BES, Nobori™, Terumo, Tokyo) was bent at the center articulation with laterally positioned links (Figure 1(a)), and there were no links on the greater curvature side of its bent position. There was some angle between the proximal main vessel (PMV) and the distal main vessel (DMV), and an SB is generally located on the greater curvature side in vivo. When the bent position of the bent BES was matched to the carina of a phantom bifurcation vessel along the guidewire curved by the angle between the PMV and DMV, the convex side of the bent stent was automatically positioned towards the carina (Figure 1(b)). After the bent BES was deployed, lateral-sided views (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)) with the SB ostium viewed from the outside (Figure 1(e)) and instant stent-accentuated 3D-OCT (iSA3D-OCT) that was reconstructed from OCT (Dragonfly™ JP, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) by freeware ImageJ 1.47v (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) with macroprograms of my own design [7, 8] indicated achievement of the free carina type (Figure 1(f)).Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed on a 79-year-old woman for stenosis of the proximal left circumflex artery (LCx) (Figure 2(a)). A 3.5 × 18 mm BES was bent at the center articulation with laterally positioned links (Figure 2(b)). The center of this BES was matched to the carina of the left main bifurcation (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)) and this BES was deployed on the left main coronary artery-LCx. After the guidewire was recrossed to the left anterior descending artery, the iSA3D-OCT, reconstructed from OCT (Dragonfly OPTIS™, St. Jude Medical) as described above, showed the free carina type and distal cell rewiring (Figure 2(e) and clip 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/5198173). After KBD was performed, final coronary angiography (Figure 2(f)) and iSA3D-OCT (Figure 2(g) and clip 2 in Supplementary Material available online) showed a good result.The bent stent technique can be limited by deviation of an SB ostium from the greater curvature side of a main vessel, by positioning with X-ray fluorographic guidance, or by crossability lowered by bending. Even if an SB ostium shifts slightly from the greater curvature of a main vessel or the convex side of the bent BES shifts slightly from a carina, links of bent position may be positioned on the lateral sides of an SB ostium by the bent stent technique and therefore can be successfully apposed to a lateral wall by KBD. Precise measurement of the lesion length is required to decide the stent length and bent position. Stenting position has to be decided by X-ray fluorography and coronary angiography, and an error of the width of only one segment is allowed. In this case, the bent position was at the center, and the bent BES was therefore easily positioned. Angiography system with the stent enhancement program, which my institution does not possess, may be helpful for positioning of stents. It may not be possible to insert a bent stent to a distal lesion, because of its lowered crossability; however, the bent stent technique may be suitable for left main bifurcation stenting that requires larger dilatation of an SB and that does not require higher crossability. In culotte stenting, floating struts on an SB ostium after first-stent implantation can affect second-stent implantation and therefore adequate SB dilation after first-stent implantation is required. The bent stent technique may help to achieve the free carina type. Confirmation of the distal cell rewiring by stent-enhanced 3D-OCT is also important. I conclude that the bent stent technique has the potential to improve outcomes in patients undergoing bifurcation stenting but needs further study to indicate that.The author declares that there are no competing interests with regard to this report.The author thanks Tooru Ueda, Takamasa Oda, Masashi Kanemoto, Yasuhiro Ikeda, and Takashi Fujii of the Department of Cardiology of Yamaguchi Grand Medical Center for their support.

Reactive Pulmonary Capillary Hemangiomatosis and Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease in a Patient with Repaired Scimitar Syndrome
1Division of Pulmonology, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich,  Switzerland2Institute of Surgical Pathology, University Hospital Zurich, 8091 Zurich,  Switzerland3Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Zurich, 8091 Zurich,  SwitzerlandReceived 4 December 2015; Revised 27 February 2016; Accepted 6 March 2016Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2016 Eva Güttinger et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) is a rare histological substrate within the spectrum of pulmonary arterial hypertension that possibly represents an unusual manifestation of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). One of the histological hallmarks of PCH is the proliferation of pulmonary capillaries in the alveolar septa that infiltrate adjacent structures such as bronchioles, vessels, and visceral pleura. The hyperplastic process involving the smallest vessels of the pulmonary vascular bed might reflect uncontrolled angiogenesis, but whether this vascular proliferation is idiopathic or, conversely, a reactive process remains to be elucidated. Here we discuss the pathogenesis of PCH exemplified by the first reported case of a young patient with repaired scimitar syndrome that developed unilateral PCH.Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) are rare types of histopathological substrates within the spectrum of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PCH is characterized by extensive proliferation of pulmonary capillaries. The etiology of these alterations is unclear. PCH has been reported to occur both idiopathically and hereditarily. In addition, PCH might represent a reactive process due to hypoxia and chronic congestion. In the context of congenital heart disease, several mechanisms including impaired pulmonary venous outflow and reactive circulatory overload might predispose to the development of PCH. Here we describe the case of a patient with scimitar syndrome that developed unilateral PCH following surgical repair. The findings discussed support the concept that PCH is a reactive angioproliferative process.We here describe a 28-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with scimitar syndrome a few days after birth. Scimitar syndrome is a very rare anomaly described to occur in about two of 100,000 births, of which females are affected in a twofold predominance. This syndrome is defined by the presence of a scimitar vein that provides an abnormal venous drainage of the right lung into the inferior vena cava. In addition, several other cardiopulmonary anomalies have been described in association with a scimitar vein (reviewed in [1]) including but not limited to hypoplasia of the right lung with consecutive dextroposition of the right heart, pulmonary sequestration, perimembranous ventricular septal defect, and a persistent ductus arteriosus. All these abnormal findings were present in the case described here.At the age of five months, the girl underwent surgical repair to redirect the anomalous lung veins via patch into the left atrium, closure of the ventricular septal defect, and ligature of the ductus arteriosus. The pre- and postoperative situations are illustrated in Figure 1. The postoperative cardiac catheterization on the day of the operation showed complete obstruction of the right-sided pulmonary venous return and missing anterograde perfusion of the right lung. Due to the complex anatomical situation no further surgical interventions were performed and the patient remained stable with slightly impaired functional capacity for over 20 years.At the age of 28, hemodynamic assessment by right heart catheterization confirmed complete occlusion of the right pulmonary artery and elevated pulmonary pressure (mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of 29 mmHg with normal wedge pressure (PAWP) of 14 mmHg). Long-term oxygen therapy and PH-specific treatment with an endothelin-receptor antagonist (bosentan) were established. The course during the following years was characterized by frequent pulmonary infections but the clinical status remained stable under treatment with bosentan, diuretics, and oral anticoagulation. At the age of 34, a new episode of severe pulmonary infection with subsequent respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiorgan failure occurred. Despite maximal therapeutic efforts, the patient deteriorated further and died one day after deescalation of treatment to a palliative concept.At autopsy, complete occlusion of the redirected right pulmonary veins and hypoplasia of the right lung were found. The lungs had dense consolidation suggesting diffuse alveolar damage as a consequence of pulmonary infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Massive dilatation and hypertrophy of the right ventricle was found (“cor pulmonale”) indicating severe pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. Microscopic analysis (Figure 2) showed pulmonary veno-occlusive disease with prominent pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis of the left lung. In particular, thickening of the alveolar septa due to capillary proliferation and congestion and massive iron deposition in the alveolar spaces secondary to venous obstruction were found (Figure 2(a)). Moreover, arterialization and intimal fibrosis of venules in the interlobular septa with subtotal luminal occlusion were described (Figure 2(b)). Conversely, the right lung was characterized by a normal alveolar architecture (Figure 2(c)). Right-sided pulmonary arteries showed alterations probably due to pressure overload with intimal proliferation and hypertrophy of the medial layer (Figure 2(d)) but no signs of PCH or PVOD, indicating a reactive, unilateral process of the left lung.Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is hemodynamically defined by an increase of the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥25 mmHg and, according to the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP), can further be distinguished in pre- and postcapillary PH [2]. PH is an umbrella term [3] and subsumes many different clinical entities, which are classified in five distinct groups shown as follows.Simplified Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension (Modified from [4])Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH):Idiopathic.Heritable.Drug and toxin-induced.Associated with connective tissue disease, HIV infection, portal hypertension, congenital heart diseases, and schistosomiasis.Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH).Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease.Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia.Chronic thromboembolic hypertension (CTEPH).Pulmonary hypertension with unclear multifactorial mechanisms.Of note, PH related to left-sided heart disease is classified as group 2, whereas precapillary PH developing in patients with grown-up congenital heart disease (GUCH) is classified as group 1 (PAH) [4].Pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiology of PH in the cohort of GUCH patient are ill-defined and are affected by type of the defect and type and timing of surgical repair. The association between scimitar syndrome and PH, at least in the preoperative setting, is well known [5–7]. The mainstay of therapy for scimitar syndrome is surgical repair, as performed in the case of our patient, which improves outcome. However, these patients are not cured by surgery and long-term complications including obstruction of redirected pulmonary veins as observed in the patient described here are not uncommon [8]. These patients may consecutively develop postcapillary PH. The role of PH-target therapies in this setting is of unclear benefit. Of interest, our patient developed complete occlusion of the right pulmonary artery, and elevated pulmonary pressure was measured in the contralateral (left) pulmonary artery, with normal wedge pressure. These observations implicate other pathogenic mechanisms for PH in our patient.As such, the necroptic findings of combined PCH and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) in the left lung might provide a plausible explanation for this unique constellation.Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) represent rare, different types of histological substrates within the spectrum of PH group 1 (PAH) that involve the capillaries and the venules, respectively [9].PCH is characterized by abnormal proliferation of capillary vessels in the pulmonary interstitium, leading to thickening of the alveolar septa. These capillaries are typically located around the bronchovascular bundles and frequently invade small pulmonary vessels. Vascular proliferation may lead to arterial or venous occlusion and nodular lesions (Figure 2). Unspecific histological hallmarks include intimal thickening and medial hypertrophy [10]. The etiology of PCH is unknown. While the onset of PCH appears to occur sporadically, two familial cases have been reported that suggest a genetic predisposition [11]. It is assumed that chronic congestion and hypoxia might play an important role in the emergence of PCH [12, 13], since angiogenesis is a commonly observed response to these triggers. In addition, inflammation and increased levels of local growth factors might be involved.PVOD frequently appears together with PCH and is characterized by fibrous intimal thickening resulting in obstruction of the small pulmonary venules [14, 15]. Whether PCH and PVOD represent distinct entities or different phenotypical expression of the same condition with arteriocapillary or venous predomination is unclear. However, cooccurrence, as in our case here, is evident [16]. Of note, it is estimated that PCH/PVOD is found in up to 10% of patients that were primary thought to have idiopathic PAH [17].Identification of PCH/PVOD is of major importance since treatment with PH-target vasodilators might be devastating and result in the development of pulmonary edema [18]. Anecdotal reports have described improvement of PCH/PVOD under treatment with Interferon-alpha-2a [19], but the results are not satisfying and prognosis is poor. The only curative therapy in these cases is lung transplantation [20].While the clinical classification of PH recognizes PCH as a distinct entity [4], histological studies have provided evidence that PVOD and PCH represent the extreme ends of one disease spectrum. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that PCH should be regarded as a reactive rather than a neoplastic angioproliferative mechanism [16]. For proliferating capillaries in the context or as a consequence of PVOD the term “secondary PCH” was presented and, conversely, “primary PCH” should be reserved for the rare idiopathic cases of PCH [16]. In congenital heart disease, however, several conditions such as capillary congestion due to impaired pulmonary venous outflow and reactive circulatory overload predispose for the development of PCH. Consistent with this hypothesis, two cases of children with PH in the context of congenital left-to-right cardiac shunts have been described in which lung biopsy showed the typical patterns of PCH [21]. Moreover, in one of these patients a congenital stenosis of the central right pulmonary arterial branch was identified. This patient developed PCH in the contralateral lung, indicating hypercirculation and volume overload as triggering factors.The occurrence of PCH in one lung only following operative repair of scimitar syndrome complicated by unilateral pulmonary artery occlusion supports the concept that PCH is a reactive rather than a neoplastic angioproliferative process. In this context vascular shear stress induced by hypercirculation might provide a plausible explanation for the unilateral manifestation of PCH.The authors are deeply saddened by the unexpected death of their teacher and friend Rudolf Speich.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Treatment of a Coronary Bifurcation Lesion Using One Dedicated Sirolimus Eluting Bifurcation Stent in Combination with a Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold: A Novel Option for Coronary Bifurcation Approach
Department of Cardiology, Hospital de Jerez de la Frontera, Jerez de la Frontera, Ronda de Circunvalación s/n, 11407 Cádiz,  SpainReceived 27 January 2016; Accepted 28 February 2016Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2016 Javier Benezet et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We present a complex bifurcation lesion treated with a new two-stent strategy combining a dedicated sirolimus eluting bifurcation stent, BiOSS Lim, with a bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS). The advantages of this strategy compared with the conventional two-stent approach are as follows: the dedicated stent protects the carina from being damaged, the large cell at the middle zone of the BiOSS Lim gives possibility to enter easily into the side branch (SB) with any standard size conventional device, and, finally, the additional use of BVS in the SB could have a long-term benefit in terms of restenosis.Coronary bifurcations lesions are considered technically challenging and associated with worse clinical outcomes than nonbifurcation lesions [1]. Although a provisional stenting strategy is the preferred method, a two-stent technique is unavoidable in some settings [2]. Therefore, it is still important to improve two-stent treatment strategies for complex bifurcation lesions in which the side branch (SB) is involved. The use of dedicated bifurcation stents might facilitate the procedure, even in complex and challenging anatomies. The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) resulted in a lower event rate and a reduction of main branch (MB) restenosis. However, SB ostial restenosis remains a problem [3]. The use of bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) as SB stent might have a potential benefit after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of bifurcation lesions because, after complete BVS resorption, SB struts can no longer cause late restenosis at the SB ostium as metallic stents do.We present a case of a bifurcation lesion treated with one dedicated sirolimus eluting bifurcation stent, BiOSS Lim (Balton, Warsaw, Poland) in combination with the Absorb (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) BVS. We demonstrate the feasibility of this two-stent technique for the treatment of complex bifurcation lesions.A 59-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented with a 2-month history of exertional chest pain. An echocardiogram showed normal heart wall movement with normal left ventricular ejection fraction and the treadmill test was positive. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed an 85% stenosis in proximal-mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) and another 80% stenosis in the proximal segment of a large first diagonal (D1) SB (Figure 1(a)) without significant obstructive lesions in the other vessels. That was a Medina class 111 bifurcation lesion [4]. PCI was performed using a right radial artery approach. With a 6 Fr EBU 3.5 guiding catheter the left main  coronary artery was engaged. A Sion (Asahi Intecc, Japan) guide wire was placed in the LAD and another one was wired into the D1. A kissing balloon predilatation with a 2.5 × 12 mm semicompliant balloon in LAD and a 2.0 × 12 mm balloon in D1 was done (Figure 1(b)). Then a BiOSS Lim 3.75 mm/3.0 mm × 15 mm stent in direction of LAD was implanted (Figure 1(c)). The BiOSS Lim stent is a coronary, dedicated bifurcation, balloon expandable stent made of 316 L stainless steel with a strut thickness of 120 μm. It is covered with a mixture of a biodegradable polymer and sirolimus. The stent consists of two parts (the proximal one with a larger diameter in relation to the distal one) connected with two struts (average 1.5 mm length) at the middle zone. This zone ensures “self-positioning” of a stent after balloon deflation, as well as the opening to SB. Rewiring or passing other PCI devices through the middle zone of the stent struts becomes simpler and time saving. The BiOSS Lim stent delivery balloon has three markers (distal and proximal indicating stent edges and one midmarker showing the midzone); the midmarker should be placed exactly at the tip of the carina. This ensures that after deployment the contralateral SB wall is covered with struts to the same extent as the proximal MB part of the bifurcation and this can be achieved with routine angiogram [5].After BiOSS Lim stent implantation, the D1 stenosis was predilated with a 3 × 8 mm semicompliant balloon that could be easily passed through the BiOSS Lim stent without predilatation to dilate the stent struts. A 3.0 × 12 mm Absorb BVS was positioned through the BiOSS Lim struts into the SB and implanted with the help of a 1.5 × 10 mm balloon (“sentinel-balloon technique”) in the LAD that avoided BVS protrusion into MB. Using as a reference its radiopaque mark, the 1.5 × 10 mm balloon (“sentinel-balloon”) was placed covering the D1 ostium, to guide BVS implantation at the SB ostium (Figure 1(d)). The Absorb scaffold size selection was performed using quantitative coronary angiographic (QCA) analysis. After optimization of the proximal MB with a 4 × 12 mm noncompliant balloon the procedure was finished with final kissing balloon. Final angiography showed no residual stenosis and adequate flow (Figure 2(a)). The QCA analysis revealed that BiOSS Lim and Absorb BVS implantation caused a significant increase of minimal lumen diameter (BiOSS Lim: prestenting  mm; poststenting  mm; Absorb BVS: prestenting  mm; poststenting  mm) and decrease of % diameter stenosis (DS) in MB and SB (BiOSS Lim: prestenting 74.2%; poststenting 20,9%; Absorb BVS: prestenting 70.1%; poststenting 20.7%). In the end the bifurcation was assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) (C7 Dragonfly, St. Jude Medical Lightlab Inc., Westford, MA, USA) that showed good apposition and expansion of the BiOSS Lim and the Absorb BVS without any scaffold protrusion into MB (Figure 2(b)). Plaque and carina shift (defined as an increase in the plaque-volume and a decrease in the vessel-volume at the SB ostium, resp.) towards LAD were not found after MB stenting. There was no procedural complication and the patient remained angina-free after the procedure and was discharged with 1-year period of dual antiplatelet therapy. After six months of clinical follow-up the patient remained free of angina and cardiac events.We present a case of complex bifurcation lesion treated with a simple and fast two-stent technique including a single dedicated bifurcation sirolimus eluting stent, BiOSS Lim, for the MB, and an Absorb BVS for the SB. It is an optimal strategy in a complex setting such as the patient of this case report when the SB is stenosed at the ostium over 50% and its diameter exceeds 2 mm.When the SB is not severely diseased, implantation of a stent in the MB and provisional stenting in the SB is the preferred strategy. But when a two-stent technique is necessary, an effective strategy to stent both branches should be taken as early as possible. An appropriate and timely decision will affect the result, save time and cost, and lower the risk of complications.Our strategy has several advantages compared with conventional two-stent approach. First, those relating to BiOSS Lim stent: the construction of the BiOSS Lim stent minimizes the negative effects of procedure protecting the carina from being damaged keeping the SB patent without ostium compromise; the large cell at the middle zone of the stent allows an easy access to the SB with any standard size conventional stent and the precision of implantation procedure thanks to the BiOSS Lim three radiopaque markers.Another interesting detail is the use of BVS in the SB. Using temporary stents eliminates permanent double layers of struts at the SB ostium and could decrease restenosis rates in bifurcation lesions. In addition, the BVS has the potential to restore a more normal vascular physiology of the treated vessel [6]. On the other hand, there are some inherent limitations for using two BVS in two-stent techniques like the difficulty to deliver a BVS to the SB across the MB BVS [7] and the signals for increased early scaffold thrombosis (ST) [8]. The combination of BiOSS Lim stent with a BVS can decrease these limitations. With this novel approach the possibility to use fewer steps than the routine two-stent techniques (less predilatation to allow passage of stents) can save time, contrast, and myocardial ischemic time. About ST, recent studies have raised concern regarding the risk of ST after PCI and implantation of the Absorb BVS [9, 10]. Patients who underwent PCI and placement of a BVS had cardiovascular outcomes comparable to those of patients who received DES but had a higher incidence of definite/probable stent thrombosis. Optimal predilatation and systematic use of intravascular ultrasound or OCT to demonstrate scaffold apposition could reduce the ST rates. Further randomized controlled studies are necessary to assess whether the risk of ST after BVs implantation is increased compared with DES. On the other hand, rates of ST observed early might be offset by a significant reduction in the long-term risks associated with permanent metallic stent covering, although that remains unknown at present.To our knowledge, this is the first-in-man combined use of the Absorb BVS and the BiOSS Lim stent. We showed that the combined use of these two devices for the treatment of complex bifurcation lesions was feasible and simplified the procedure.All procedures performed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institution or practice.Written informed consent was obtained from the patient described in the case report to be published.The authors report no financial relationships or competing interests regarding the content herein.
Neoatherosclerosis in Very Late Stenosis of Bare Metal Stent by Optical Coherence Tomography
Department of Cardiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655,  USAReceived 29 October 2015; Accepted 28 February 2016Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2016 Samer Mowakeaa et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Bare metal stents (BMS) continue to be widely used in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous revascularization. Progressive luminal renarrowing has been reported late after BMS implantation resulting in a significant rate of stent failure events. We present a case of very late BMS failure due to in-stent restenosis where optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to demonstrate neoatherosclerosis as the underlying mechanism. We provide a brief review of neoatherosclerosis and showcase salient features on OCT evaluation.Despite the high rates of drug-eluting stent utilization in the United States [1], bare metal stents (BMS) continue to be widely used in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous revascularization (15% of the patients in 2014) [2]. Very late stent failure, occurring >10 years after initial implantation, is not an infrequent finding with bare metal stents (BMS) [3]. Progressive luminal renarrowing beyond 4 years after BMS placement has been reported previously [3, 4]. Although multiple factors contributing to late stent failure have been proposed, de novo development of atherosclerosis within the neointima has been identified as a major cause [5, 6].Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an intravascular imaging modality that uses near-infrared light and provides high resolution images of the vascular wall with a detailed assessment of neointimal tissue [7]. Thus, OCT can be a valuable tool used to identify the mechanism of stent failure by demonstrating distinct tissue characteristics.A 66-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with an episode of chest pain during atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response following a month history of progressive exertional chest pain. He had been treated 15 years previously with two overlapping Duet 3.5 × 23 mm and 3.5 × 13 mm BMS to his proximal and mid right coronary artery. Electrocardiography did not show ischemic changes at rest, but a significant rise in cardiac biomarkers was noted, consistent with a diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography demonstrated a critical stenosis within the prior stent in the mid-RCA (Figure 1(a)) that was occlusive to flow when crossed with a Dragonfly Duo OCT catheter. Focal predilation of the severe stenosis was performed using a Trek 3.0 × 12 mm balloon to improve distal vessel flow. Subsequent OCT confirmed severe in-stent restenosis with a percent area stenosis of 78% and minimal luminal area of 2.3 mm2. OCT also revealed the presence of neoatherosclerosis with fibrocalcific plaque, lipid pools, macrophage accumulation, and neoangiogenesis (Figures 1(b)–1(d)) throughout the majority of the stent’s length. A site of old plaque rupture was visualized within the stented segment neoatheroma (Figure 1(e)) with no evidence of acute thrombus. An incidental finding of malapposed uncovered struts at the proximal stent segment was also seen (Figure 1(f)).The present study illustrates a case of very late stent failure due to severe in-stent restenosis (ISR) causing progressive exertional angina and a type 2 myocardial infarction. Intravascular imaging with the use of OCT was used to help identify the underlying mechanism of stent failure revealing distinct features consistent with the presence of neoatherosclerosis.A series of luminal changes have been previously described following BMS implantation [4]. Emerging data suggests that neoatherosclerosis plays a major role in the pathophysiology of late ISR (beyond 4 years) [5, 6]. Neoatherosclerosis is histologically characterized by foamy macrophage clusters that accumulate forming fibroatheromas, with or without a necrotic core and/or calcification within the neointima [8]. Further infiltration of foamy macrophages within the neointima results in the formation of a thin-cap fibroatheroma, which may in turn lead to in-stent plaque rupture. In all cases, there is no communication between the in-stent lesion and the underlying native atherosclerotic plaque. As demonstrated by OCT images in our case, the ISR lesion showed similar findings (Figures 1(b)–1(e)). The exact elements leading to development of neoatherosclerosis are unknown, but it is speculated that endothelial dysfunction contributes to the process [6, 8].OCT provides superior resolution intravascular images of the neointima. Characterization of neoatherosclerotic tissue by OCT has been described previously [8]. Foamy macrophage accumulation appears as a thin bright signal with a trailing shadow. A necrotic core is visualized as high attenuation signal poor region with poorly defined borders. It is important to recognize, however, that signal poor areas in OCT imaging are not exclusively caused by necrotic core (other causes for poor signal areas include fibrin accumulation, granulation tissue, lipid pool, and organized thrombus) [8].Identifying the underlying process resulting in very late stent failure in our patient is the first step to better understand its development and allow for further research of targeted preventative therapies.Neoatherosclerosis is an important cause of very late ISR and stent thrombosis [9]. This study showcases characteristic findings and highlights the utility of OCT in the evaluation of the coronary pathophysiology.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Left Main Coronary Artery Hypoplasia in Elderly

A 67-year-old woman with no coronary risk factors was referred for coronary angiography with few months’ history of angina. The patient underwent coronary angiography due to ischemic cardiac symptoms with nondiagnostic exercising test. In coronary angiography, the left main coronary artery was arising from normal anatomical position; however, left anterior descending artery and circumflex artery were hypoplastic. The treatment of patient was discussed in cardiology-cardiovascular surgery council and coronary surgery was found inappropriate due to the hypoplasia of the left coronary system entirely. Hypoplastic coronary artery disease (HCAD) refers to congenital underdevelopment of one or more major branches of the coronary arteries with the absence of compensatory collateral circulatory vessels. Coronary artery anomalies have an incidence of approximately 1% in the general population and one postmortem survey identified HCAD in 2.2% of the patients with coronary artery anomalies [1, 2]. Postmortem analyses of athletes were identified in less than 5% of the total patients and comprised less than 33% of the observed congenital artery anomalies. Initial presentation could be sudden cardiac death in young patients. At present, congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries are being diagnosed accurately by selective coronary angiography during life. There are seldom case presentations about coronary agenesis or hypoplasia in the literature. The case we present is interesting due to complete hypoplastic left coronary system in elderly.A 67-year-old woman with no coronary risk factors was referred for coronary angiography with few months’ history of angina. There was not any ischemic change in electrocardiography. The echocardiography demonstrated diastolic dysfunction. Patient underwent coronary angiography due to ischemic cardiac symptoms with nondiagnostic exercising test. In coronary angiography, left main coronary artery (LMCA) was arising from normal anatomical position; however, left anterior descending artery (LAD) and circumflex artery (Cx) were hypoplastic. Right coronary artery (RCA) was arising from right sinus Valsalva and well-developed collateral system perfused the left coronary system. There was not stenosis or calcification in any coronary arteries (see Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4156581). In the case we presented, ostial LMCA agenesis was not observed; however, both LAD and Cx were uniformly narrow on the basis of its intrinsic structure and were of shorter course than normal.The patient underwent computerized tomography (CT) for further evaluation of coronary anatomy. CT angiography confirmed the LMCA hypoplasia with well-developed collateral system from RCA as demonstrated by conventional coronary angiography (Figure 1).The treatment of patient was discussed in cardiology-cardiovascular surgery council and coronary surgery was found inappropriate due to the hypoplasia of left coronary system entirely. We decided to stick to medical treatment including betablocker, nitrate, and statins.Congenital anomalies of the coronary artery causing coronary occlusive disease may be of many different types. Abnormalities of the origin of one or both arteries of the structure of arteries, their number, size, or distribution are among the possibilities [3]. Hypoplastic coronary artery or rudimentary coronary artery was described by Wenger and Chiemprapha [4, 5]. In these conditions, the coronary artery or a main coronary artery branch was uniformly narrow on the basis of its intrinsic structure and had a shorter course than normal. The LAD or LCX is usually involved, but the RCA may also be affected.The demand of left ventricle can not be maintained in these conditions causing severe clinical presentations such as coronary occlusive disease in childhood or remaining asymptomatic. The cases with the left coronary hypoplasia and agenesis of the left main coronary ostium were presented in the literature. A case of four-month baby with shorter left coronary system which was visualized lately from RCA angiogram was presented in 1988 [6]. In our case, LMCA was hypoplastic, but the ostium agenesis was not observed. The LMCA was cannulated successfully with diagnostic catheter and angiography was performed. LAD and Cx were significantly underdeveloped. The right coronary artery was large and many collateral vessels supplied the area normally perfused by the left coronary artery. Hypoplasia of left coronary system was diffuse.Congenital HCAD is sometimes associated with other cardiac anomalies. In 1975 and 1979, Chiemprapha and Tangchai and Line et al., respectively, published cases of aortic valve abnormalities with hypoplastic coronary artery [5].Saji et al. demonstrated hypoplastic left coronary system with severe obstructive intimal hyperplasia in an autopsy in which a 13-year-old case was evaluated due to sudden cardiac death in 1984. Moderate interstitial fibrosis and edema have been observed. Saji et al. thought that the organization of the coronary wall and the abnormality in the maturation was responsible for the pathogenesis. In addition, they signified that HCAD has stated hosting the atherosclerotic lesions [7].Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a common presentation of the condition, likely from arrhythmia triggered by myocardial ischemia. In some of these cases, symptoms such as syncope, palpitations, dyspnea, and chest pain are present beforehand, while in many cases SCD is the first manifestation.Surgical treatment for coronary artery hypoperfusion due to a single coronary artery and atresia or stenosis of the coronary ostium has been reported [6, 8]. In our case, surgery was found impossible due to the entire left coronary system hypoplasia.In our literature surveillance, we found that most of the cases were baby or young adults presented with sudden cardiac death. McFarland et al. published a 21-year-old young male case presented with unexplained syncope. The patient underwent implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy for secondary prevention [2]. ICD implantation may be successful for the prevention of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Heart transplantation may be indicated in patients who develop ischemic cardiomyopathy with end stage heart failure [2, 9].In the case we presented, the patient has chronic stable angina pectoris without any symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias or syncope. The coronary anatomy was found to be inappropriate for cardiac surgery. Patient has been followed up without any cardiac events for one year.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Chest Pain: The Need to Consider Less Frequent Diagnosis
1Serviço de Cardiologia, Centro Hospitalar de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, 5000-508 Vila Real,  Portugal2Serviço de Medicina Interna, Centro Hospitalar de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, 5000-508 Vila Real,  PortugalReceived 30 November 2015; Accepted 10 February 2016Academic Editor: Tayfun SahinCopyright © 2016 Pedro Magalhães et al.

The commonest underlying causes are well known, but, sometimes, in some clinical scenarios, it is necessary to consider other diagnoses. We report a case of a 68-year-old Caucasian male, chronically hypertensive, who complained of recurrent episodes of chest pain and fever with elevated acute phase reactants. The first investigation was negative for some of the most likely diagnosis and he quickly improved with anti-inflammatory drugs. Over a few months, his symptoms continued to recur periodically, his hypertension was aggravated, and he developed headaches and lower limbs claudication. After a temporal artery biopsy that was negative for vasculitis, he underwent a positron emission tomography suggestive of Takayasu Arteritis. Takayasu Arteritis is a rare chronic granulomatous vasculitis of the aorta and its first-order branches affecting mostly females up to 50 years old. Chest pain is experienced by >40% of the patients and results from the inflammation of the aorta, pulmonary artery, or coronaries.Chest pain is one of the most frequent symptoms driving patients to a physician’s practice or to the hospital’s emergency department. Although the prevalence of each aetiology differs according to the clinical setting, the underlying causes of chest pain are more commonly due to gastrointestinal, cardiac, chest wall/musculoskeletal, respiratory/pulmonary, and psychiatric disorders [1–3]. Nevertheless, in some clinical scenarios and after the exclusion of these aetiologies, it is important to consider other less common causes. We are presenting a clinical case that is representative of such investigation.A 68-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department (ER) with a 6-day history of intense retrosternal pain, radiating to the dorsum and left arm, plus fever. He also had a history of high blood pressure (HBP), medicated with olmesartan 20 mg id and headaches. On admission, he was hypertensive (162/81 mmHg) and febrile (38.2°C) without any other abnormalities at physical examination. His chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal. Blood analysis revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 81 mm) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 9.2 mg/dL) and normal myocardial necrosis markers. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed showing a mild pericardial thickening. Acute pericarditis was assumed and the patient was discharged with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).The patient returned to the ER 2 days later with the same complaints. He maintained high acute phase reactants (APR) (ESR 82 mm, CRP 11.1 mg/dL), without other physical, laboratorial, or radiological changes, and he was then admitted to the Internal Medicine Service for further investigation. Through several virologic and serologic markers, we excluded tuberculosis, syphilis, infection by Brucella, Rickettsia, Salmonella, hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, HIV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and Coxsackie A and Coxsackie B. We did not isolate any microorganisms in blood or urine cultures. Myocardial necrosis markers and d-dimers did not rise. Autoantibody tests (antinuclear, anti-dsDNA, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic, antiphospholipid, and anti-citrulline antibodies and rheumatoid factor) were proven negative and angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. He repeated TTE which was normal and underwent an abdominal and renal ultrasound that displayed no significant alterations. When under NSAID treatment, his symptoms ceased, the APR levels diminished, and he did not show any other analytical abnormalities. He was discharged 5 days later and referred to the Internal Medicine’s ambulatory for further workup.In the meantime, the patient developed recurrent episodes of chest pain, claudication of the lower limbs, headaches, and HBP aggravation which imposed prescription reinforcement by the general practitioner (olmesartan + hydrochlorothiazide).Six months later, he returned to the ER with a 12-day history of fever and severe headaches. Once again laboratory analysis showed not only elevated APR (ESR 120 mm, CRP 11.4 mg/dL), but also normochromic normocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 11.6 g/dL) and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 3.0 g/dL). The chest X-ray, TTE, and cerebral computed tomography were normal. The patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine Service for further investigation and underwent a temporal artery biopsy, which was negative for vasculitis. We then decided to perform a positron emission tomography (PET) that showed an increased uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) at the subclavian, carotid, humeral, vertebral, and femoral arteries and less intensively at the ascending and descending aorta, suggestive of Takayasu Arteritis (TA) (Figure 1). An arteriography was also performed revealing diffuse areas of narrowing and dilation at the aorta and main branches (Figure 2). Oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg) was prescribed with symptoms resolution and the patient was discharged under the same therapeutics.The patient was reassessed on an outpatient basis 1 month later, free of symptoms, with stabilized BP and normalization of the APR and haemoglobin. By the end of the first year of treatment, he repeated PET that showed radiologic improvement but still metabolic activity of 18F-FDG (Figure 3(a)) and he was then started on methotrexate 15 mg/week. The two-year follow-up PET revealed additional radiologic improvement allowing prednisolone suspension and reduction of the methotrexate dosage (7.5 mg/week) (Figure 3(b)). The three-year follow-up PET did not show any 18F-FDG uptake (Figure 3(c)). This time around, the patient was hospitalized for uncomplicated influenza pneumonia. Methotrexate was suspended and it was decided not to reinitiate it, taking under consideration the last PET result. Since then, without any prednisolone or methotrexate, he has remained symptom free, with mild APR elevation and without any disease associated complications.TA is a relatively rare chronic idiopathic granulomatous large vessel vasculitis (LVV) affecting the aorta and its first-order branches, with an estimated prevalence of 2.6/1,000,000 persons in the United States and 1.26/1,000,000 persons in northern Europe [4, 5]. It tends to affect patients up to 50 years old with female gender predominance (80–90%). The age of onset is usually between 10 and 40 years. Although there is a considerable variability on disease expression, the initial vascular lesion often starts in the left subclavian artery and subsequently spreads to involve the left common carotid, left vertebral, brachiocephalic, right subclavian, right vertebral, and right common carotid arteries. Thoracic aorta is commonly affected, whereas abdominal aorta and pulmonary arteries are involved in 50% of the patients [4].Symptoms resulting from systemic inflammation, such as fever, weight loss, fatigue, malaise, arthralgias, or myalgias, are common in the early stage of the disease and may represent the systemic effects of cytokines [4].Vascular symptoms and signs are rare at presentation and reflect the affected arterial territories. Chest pain is experienced by >40% of the patients and results from the inflammation at the aortic arch or root level (affected in 35% of the patients), pulmonary artery (10–40%), or the coronaries (<10%) [6, 7]. Headaches are a consequence of the carotid and vertebral arteries involvement with decreased cerebral blood flow affecting 45% of the patients [7, 8]. Lower limb claudication occurs in 18–30% of the patients and reflects disease of the iliac [7, 9]. Hypertension is developed in more than a half of the cases due to the narrowing of the renal artery or narrowing and decreased elasticity of the aorta and branches [5].Interestingly, far from the commonest scenario, our patient is a 68-year-old male. He shows both systemic and vascular symptoms. His chest pain was most likely related to the involvement of the ascending aorta and his multiple and different symptoms reflect the disseminated character of his disease.Laboratory changes reflect the inflammatory process and include elevated ESR and CRP, normochromic normocytic anemia, and hypoalbuminemia [6]. Nevertheless, about 25–50% of the patients have a normal acute phase response even in the presence of active disease, which also makes ESR and CRP unreliable parameters to monitor disease’s activity if used as unique criteria [4, 9]. Some autoantibodies, such as antiendothelial cell antibodies, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease, but other autoantibodies associated with other forms of vascular disease, including antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, anti-DNA, and antiphospholipid autoantibodies, are not found in TA [10]. Our patient had negative antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, anti-DNA, and antiphospholipid antibodies as well.The diagnosis of TA is usually considered upon suggestive clinical features and imaging of the arterial tree by arteriography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) that demonstrate the characteristic pattern of irregular vessel walls, stenosis, poststenotic dilation, aneurysm formation, occlusion, and evidence of increased collateral circulation [6]. MRI and CT also allow the evaluation of the vessels wall thickness. PET is another frequently used technique that detects arterial inflammation based on the vascular FDG uptake [11]. Considerable controversies concerning the modality that is best for diagnosis and follow-up exist, since there are no published comparative studies to guide us regarding the optimal imaging modality. Also, there is no consensus on how often these imaging studies should be repeated. In general, they are recommended when a relapse is suspected or, when asymptomatic, at least annually to exclude disease progression or worsening due to mechanical factors [4, 11]. Noninvasive imaging methods are essential for monitoring disease activity and response to treatment because, as discussed earlier, there is a lack of positive correlation between disease activity and the rise of APR in a very significant proportion of patients [12].Several disorders, including many forms of vasculitis, must be distinguished from TA. One of the most important and difficult differential diagnoses is Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), another granulomatous LVV that characteristically involves one or more branches of the carotid artery, particularly the temporal one, but it can also affect arteries in multiple locations and occurs almost exclusively in individuals older than 40–50 years. In fact, the age of onset of the disease is one of the most discriminatory characteristics between the two pathologies [6, 13].In this case, considering the patient’s initial complaints of chest pain and fever, we first thought of a myopericardial syndrome, but the electrocardiogram, TTE, and myocardial necrosis markers were normal. Although less likely, the hypothesis of an acute coronary syndrome was ruled out for the same reasons. We also considered a parenchymal/vascular pulmonary disease, but the atypical chest pain, normal chest X-ray, and normal leucogram made pneumonia improbable and the patient also had a low clinical likelihood for pulmonary embolism and negative d-dimers. The diagnosis of esophagitis was very unlikely, especially in an immunocompetent patient and no evidence existed to support a chest wall/musculoskeletal origin. During the first hospitalization, we have excluded many infectious aetiologies and the autoantibody tests were negative. The episodic character of the symptoms along with the new ones (headaches and limbs claudication) and the laboratorial changes (elevated APR, normochromic normocytic anaemia, and hypoalbuminemia) raised the suspicion for a systemic disease such as a vasculitis, in particular medium and large vessels one. Considering his age and headaches complaints, we first thought of GCA, and therefore we performed a temporal artery biopsy, which was negative for vasculitis. Once again, because his several and varied symptoms suggested a systemic vasculitis, we then decided to go for a broader test, thence the option for the PET scan that led us to the diagnosis of TA. We opted to keep PET for imaging follow-up and we consider our series of sequential images to be highly illustrative of the important role this image modality might play both for TA diagnosis and for follow-up.In the presence of active disease, the initial standard treatment of TA is with high doses of prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) or its equivalents for about a month, which are then gradually tapered until discontinuation. Glucocorticoids induce remission in about 60% of the patients, but relapses do occur in the majority (>50%) during steroid taper. In these cases, or when there is a need to counteract the side effects of steroids, a conventional immunosuppressive agent is added, usually methotrexate (25 mg/week). When these agents or a combination of these agents remain ineffective, or are not tolerated, biologic agents may be tried out [4, 12, 14]. We followed these recommendations, our patient responded fairly well to prednisolone in the acute phase and we were able to achieve excellent control of the disease with a low methotrexate dosage (7.5 mg/week).TA is considered to be a serious disease with a chronic relapsing-remitting course causative of significant morbidity and disability. The long-term outcome of patients with TA has varied widely between studies, with a 5-year mortality rate ranging from 0 to 35% [4, 6, 9]. A recent cohort study reports an increased mortality compared to the general population (standardized mortality ratio of 3.0) with 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year survival rates of 97%  ±  2%, 97%  ±  2%, and 86%  ±  6%, respectively [7]. Seven years after the diagnosis, our patient is doing well, being free of symptoms, and being without any disease’s complications.We believe this case highlights the importance of considering less common diagnosis when we are dealing with unexplained symptoms, especially after a relatively exhaustive first line investigation. When the clinical context strongly suggests a chronic, persistent, and inflammatory process, autoimmune aetiology must be considered.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
A Rare Case of Renal Infarct due to Noncompaction Cardiomyopathy: A Case Report and Literature Review
1Internal Medicine, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY 11219,  USA2Department of Cardiology, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY 11219,  USA3Department of Nephrology, North Shore Long Island Jewish Hospital, New Hyde Park, NY 11040,  USAReceived 27 November 2015; Accepted 1 February 2016Academic Editor: Hiroaki KitaokaCopyright © 2016 Karan Wats et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy is a rare myocardial disorder which results from failure of left ventricle to compact in embryogenesis. We present a case of a 53-year-old female who came because of abdominal pain and was found to have renal infarct secondary to noncompaction cardiomyopathy.Left ventricular noncompaction is a rare form of genetic cardiomyopathy that occurs due to arrest in the compaction of developing myocardium which leads to deep trabeculae and recesses giving the ventricle a spongiform appearance [1–4]. It has been grouped under “genetic cardiomyopathy” by the ACC/AHA [5]. While it most commonly presents as heart failure; ventricular arrhythmias, systemic embolism, or sudden death can occur [4, 6, 7]. While thromboembolic events are not uncommon, they usually present as cardioembolic stroke. We present a case of renal infarct in a middle aged female who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have noncompaction on echocardiography. In our search we found no cases of isolated renal emboli as a presentation of left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy.A 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension presented with the complaints of left sided back pain and dysuria for 2 days. Patient denied any history of chest pain, shortness of breath, or any cardiac problems in the past. Physical examination was significant for bibasilar crackles and pedal edema but no costovertebral tenderness. There was no family history of cardiomyopathy or heart failure. Routine labs showed hemoglobin, 10.5; white cell count, 6.4; platelets, 391. Renal and liver functions tests were within normal limits. An EKG test was done on admission which showed normal sinus rhythm and left axis deviation but no significant ST-T wave changes. Urine analysis was done which was negative for urinary tract infection. CT scan of abdomen (Figures 1 and 2) showed multiple areas of wedge-shaped hypoenhancement in the left kidney with mild adjacent stranding consistent with renal infarcts.Echocardiogram (Figures 3 and 4) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction, 25% with dilated left ventricle, prominent left ventricular trabeculations, and deep intertrabecular recesses communicating with the LV cavity, consistent with left ventricular noncompaction. Patient underwent an elective angiogram which revealed normal coronaries. Patient was started on heparin for renal emboli and bridged to Coumadin. She was discharged to home with a cardiologist follow-up and INR checks.Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) was first described in 1975 by Dusek et al. [1] in infant hearts as spongy myocardium. It was later described in adults by Engberding and Bender [2] as lack of sinusoidal regression in embryogenesis. Isolated left ventricular noncompaction is a rare form of cardiomyopathy which has been grouped under the genetic cardiomyopathy by the American Heart Association which is caused by arrest of compaction of myocardial fibers during embryogenesis [2–5]. It is characterized by (1) an abnormal myocardial structure characterized by prominent trabeculae and deep intertrabecular recesses with two layers of myocardium, a compacted epicardial layer and a noncompacted endocardium. (2) There is continuity and blood flow from LV to these deep intertrabecular recesses which are filled with blood but there is no evidence of communication with the epicardial coronary artery system [8, 9].LVNC is a genetically heterogeneous disorder and both familial and sporadic forms have been described. Mutations in various genes [10–12] have been described. Familial forms have been associated with mutations in mitochondrial, sarcomeric, and cytoskeletal genes. A study conducted by Murphy et al. [13] found 8 affected family members among 32 patients. Although genetic testing is not routinely recommended at this time, the Heart Failure Society of America practice guidelines [14] recommend clinical screening of all first-degree relatives of affected patients for LVNC.The incidence of isolated noncompaction varies among different studies but has been noted to be anywhere between 0.014 and 1.3%. A lot of patients with LVNC are diagnosed during the neonatal period. A significant number of these patients have undulating phenotype in which they have transient recovery of function and present with symptoms later in adult life. Most of the times in children, LVNC usually coexists with other genetic conditions like Barth syndrome, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, myotubular myopathy, and so forth, in contrast to adults where it has been known to occur in isolation. It is still unclear whether presentation of LVNC in adulthood represents a long standing condition or delayed manifestation of molecular pathology. With increasing awareness of this rare condition and better and more specific echocardiographic diagnostic parameters, the prevalence of this condition has increased.The most common forms of presentation include heart failure, arrhythmias, and systemic embolism [4, 6, 7]. In a study of 34 adult patients conducted by Oechslin et al. [4], heart failure was the presenting symptom in 68% of patients and arrhythmias most commonly observed included nonsustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia in 41% of patients. Systemic embolism, most commonly cardioembolic stroke, was observed in 21% of patients. Other forms of embolic complication which have been observed include transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, and mesenteric ischemia [8]. Our patient presented with complaints of abdominal and was eventually found to have a renal infarct which is not a common presentation for this rare disease entity.Echocardiography with color follow Doppler has been considered as the diagnostic modality of choice for diagnosis of this rare cardiomyopathy and specific criteria for diagnosis have been put forward by various researchers [6, 15–18]. Jenni et al. proposed the following criteria for diagnosis of this condition which have been shown to be highly specific for this condition:(1)A thickened ventricular wall consisting of two layers, a thin compacted epicardial layer and a markedly thickened endocardial layer with numerous trabeculations and deep recesses with a maximum ratio of noncompacted to compacted myocardium of >2 : 1 at the end systole in the parasternal short axis view.(2)Color Doppler evidence of flow within the deep intertrabecular recesses.(3)Prominent trabecular meshwork in the LV apex or midventricular segments of inferior and lateral wall
        Our patient had an echocardiogram which showed a noncompacted to compacted myocardium ratio of >2 : 1 at the ventricular apex prominent trabecular meshwork in the LV apex and color Doppler evidence of flow in the recesses thus making a diagnosis of LVNC.Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Cardiac MRI) has been increasingly used for diagnosis of noncompaction cardiomyopathy as it provides a detailed image of cardiac morphology. Cardiac MRI is particularly useful in patients in whom the apex is difficult to visualize with echocardiography or in whom the diagnosis is uncertain with conventional echocardiography. A noncompacted/compacted ratio >2.3 measured at end diastole is used as the diagnostic indicator for noncompaction cardiomyopathy [19]. A study comparing the use of echocardiography versus Cardiac MRI showed no significant difference at the end diastole but Cardiac MRI at end systole was able to better characterize the extent of compaction [20]. Despite this small difference, echocardiography continues to be the diagnostic modality of choice for noncompaction cardiomyopathy.Symptoms of heart failure are the most commonly presenting symptoms in LVNC. Tian et al. [21] found in their retrospective review that 60% with LVNC were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III/IV and 79% had systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50%). The treatment principles remain the same as any other patient presenting with heart failure. Conventional guidelines for management of heart failure by ACC/AHA should be used when managing patients with LVNC. Patients with symptoms despite optimal medical management should be considered for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation.Sudden cardiac death is another concern in these patients and should always be evaluated for presence of sustained/nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias varies from 6% [22] to 62% [6] and can lead to sudden death. ICD therapy may be considered in such cases as measure of primary prevention and should also be used in patients who have sustained ventricular tachycardia or cardiac arrest for secondary prevention. According to the Device Based Therapy guidelines [23], implantation of ICD for the prevention of sudden death in patients with LVNC is a class IIb recommendation.Systemic embolism is another complication associated with LVNC. Initially it was thought to result from stagnation of flow across the prominent trabeculations and deep recesses leading to clot formation in noncompacted layer. A retrospective review done by Stöllberger and Finsterer [24] found that the rate of clot formation and embolism in LVNC is related to the presence of concomitant conditions like low EF, presence of atrial fibrillation, or both rather than LVNC alone. Therefore, oral anticoagulation is recommended in patients with concomitant low EF, atrial fibrillation, history of systemic embolism, and so forth.Studies on asymptomatic patients with normal EF failed to show any increased risk of systemic embolism and therefore use of anticoagulation in this patient population remains controversial [25].Large case series done by Lofiego et al. [22] and Greutmann et al. [26] for outcomes in patients with isolated LV noncompaction has shown that the prognosis differed depending on the presence or absence of symptoms at presentation. During follow-up of 46 months and 32 months in these case series, respectively, cardiovascular death and heart transplantation needed to be done in 31% of the patients as compared to none in any of the asymptomatic patients.A recent retrospective review done by Tian et al. [21] in 106 patients with LVNC showed that 28 (26%) patients died or underwent heart transplantation during a follow-up of  years. The study also showed that advanced heart failure, a dilated left heart with systolic dysfunction, reduced systolic blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension, and right bundle branch block predict adverse outcomes of LVNC at the time of diagnosis.Another recent study [27] done on pediatric population showed that children who had normal or mild left ventricular dysfunction had much better prognosis in terms of arrhythmia burden and sudden cardiac death incidence further strengthening the importance of left ventricular function at the time of diagnosis and its impact on future health and outcomes.While LVNC is not common, its prevalence has increased due to better imaging modalities and more specific diagnostic criteria but still this disease may be underdiagnosed due to lack of awareness among clinicians. Our case illustrates an uncommon presentation of LVNC with renal infarction as the presenting manifestation which later leads to finding of severely decreased LV function and diagnosis of LVNC. It is important to recognize that this condition as the management of LVNC is slightly different from other causes of LV dysfunction such as the need to anticoagulate because of the high risk of thromboembolism and the familial inheritance requiring genetic counselling, screening among family members.This makes the disease, its presentations, complications, and management important for the general internist and the cardiologist to know.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Symptomatic Trifascicular Block in Steinert’s Disease: Is It Too Soon for a Pacemaker?
1Department of Internal Medicine, Overlook Medical Center, Summit, NJ 07901,  USA2Section of Cardiology, Overlook Medical Center, Summit, NJ 07901,  USAReceived 22 November 2015; Revised 30 January 2016; Accepted 4 February 2016Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2016 Glenmore Lasam et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We report a case of a 62-year-old male with Steinert’s disease who presented with progressive intermittent episodes of lightheadedness five years after he was diagnosed with the disease. On evaluation, he developed a new onset trifascicular block (first degree atrioventricular block, new onset right bundle branch block, and left anterior fascicular block). A dual chamber pacemaker was inserted and lightheadedness improved significantly.Steinert’s disease or myotonic dystrophy type 1 may present as symptomatic trifascicular block which may progress to high degree atrioventricular block and fatal arrhythmias that could lead to sudden cardiac death. This could pose a dilemma to the clinician whether to do conservative surveillance or immediate pacemaker insertion to abate symptom.A 62-year-old male was diagnosed with Steinert’s disease (myotonic dystrophy type 1) at the age of 50 when he presented with bilateral leg muscle weakness associated with numbness in his toes and occasional dysphagia compatible with esophageal dysmotility. The diagnosis was confirmed by genetic testing and electromyography. His sister, nephew, and niece were diagnosed with the same disease. Five years ago, he gradually developed jaw weakness and started complaining of intermittent episodes of lightheadedness and easy fatigability. He denied any syncope, chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, or palpitations. He had trace bipedal edema and 4/5 bilateral lower extremity motor strength. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, first degree atrioventricular block, left axis deviation, new onset right bundle branch block, and left anterior fascicular block (trifascicular block) which were new findings (Figure 2) compared to five months earlier (Figure 1). Holter monitoring did not demonstrate any pauses. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal ejection fraction. Adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging showed moderate distal anterior and distal lateral ischemia with ejection fraction of 53%. He was started on aspirin.Three months after the onset of the trifascicular block, the lightheadedness became more frequent and, even though a repeat electrocardiogram revealed no changes, a dual chamber pacemaker was recommended due to the unstable progression of conduction disease in myotonic dystrophy. The pacemaker was successfully inserted as confirmed by electrocardiogram (Figure 3) and subsequently the lightheadedness improved.Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by myotonia (delayed muscle relaxation after contraction), weakness and atrophy of skeletal muscles, and systemic manifestations including endocrine abnormalities, cataracts, cognitive impairment, and cardiac involvement [1]. There are two types of myotonic dystrophy. Classical DM, called Steinert’s disease or myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), has been associated with the presence of an abnormal expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat on chromosome 19q13.3 [2] in the DMPK gene that codes for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, a protein mainly expressed in smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscle cells [3]. Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by a dominantly transmitted CCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of the zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9) gene on chromosome 3q [4]. A critical element in the pathogenesis of this disease in both types is the intranuclear accumulation of the expanded RNA sequences which disrupt the regulation of alternative splicing of mRNA and perturb the expression of many genes; thus multiple systems are affected clinically. DM1 is more common, affecting approximately 1 in 8000, making it the most common adult form of muscular dystrophy while DM2 is less common affecting approximately 1 in 20000 [5].Sixty-five percent of DM1 patients have an abnormal ECG in which conduction abnormalities are the result of myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, focal fatty infiltration, and also lymphocytic infiltration, which can occur anywhere along the conduction system including the His-Purkinje system [6]. Prolongation of the PR segment occurs in roughly 20–40% of patients and QRS widening occurs in 5–25% of patients [7], left bundle branch block in 4%, right bundle branch block in 3%, and nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay in 12% of patients [5]. Severe atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defect is related to CTG repeat length and the presence of abnormal late potential (caused by slowed and fragmented conduction through damaged areas of myocardium) is directly correlated to CTG expansion and represents a substrate for malignant reentrant ventricular arrhythmias [7].DM1, and possibly DM2, is associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiomyopathy, heart failure, conduction disorders, and arrhythmias [8]. The symptomatic presentations include palpitations, presyncope and syncope, heart failure symptoms, and sudden cardiac death [9]. Structural heart disease is also frequently observed in DM, with LV dilatation or hypertrophy observed in 20% of patients, LV systolic dysfunction in 14%, and clinical heart failure in 2% of DM1 patients based upon clinical history [10].A 12-lead EKG is an appropriate screening test and should be performed annually after the diagnosis of DM [11]. Radionucleotide imaging and echocardiography may reveal diastolic and systolic dysfunction in either ventricle [5]. Electrophysiological study (EPS) correlating the H-V interval measurement with the electrocardiographic findings may identify predictive risk factors [12], strongly recommended in patients with clinical manifestations suggestive of ventricular tachycardia and/or with a family history of sudden death [13, 14]. In an innovative study on DM1 and cardiac disease, VT could be induced at EPS in 18% of patients in the absence of ventricular arrhythmias during Holter monitoring [14]. Among DM1 patients with major infranodal conduction delays, institution of an invasive strategy utilizing systematic electrophysiological studies with subsequent prophylactic permanent pacing indicated by malignant arrhythmias is associated with nine-year survival of almost seventy-six percent [15]. An implantable loop recorder is useful in detecting fifty percent of arrhythmias in DM1 patients and should be instituted more often in apparently asymptomatic [16] as well as high risk myotonic dystrophy patients to identify asymptomatic arrhythmias [17] which aids in the determination about antiarrhythmic devices. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance may help define the LV abnormalities of the disease including dilatation, systolic dysfunction, hypertrophy, and, occasionally, noncompaction [18, 19].Based on the recommendation of the ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 Guidelines for device-based therapy, our patient qualified for the class IIB indication for pacemaker insertion which encompasses any degree of AV block (including first degree AV block), bifascicular block, or any fascicular block with or without symptoms (level of evidence: B) [20].Patients with DM have an annual mortality of approximately 3.5%, one-third of which is sudden cardiac death and the systematic identification of conduction disease, and aggressive use of prophylactic pacemakers is associated with low rate of sudden cardiac death at 1.16% per year [21]. DM1 patients even when asymptomatic presenting with the Groh’s criteria (prolonged PR of equal or >240 ms, wide QRS complex of equal or >120 ms, or atrial tachyarrhythmias) were at higher risk of sudden death when compared to those with normal ECGs [22]. The prophylactic implantation of pacemaker in high risk MD patients according to Groh’s criteria reduced the incidence rate of sudden death to 0.2 per 100 patient-years [23].The paroxysmal nature and the high prevalence of arrhythmias in DM patients reiterates the importance of follow-up not solely through regular ECG, but also through 24 h Holter monitoring since 32% of the patients showed conduction disturbances in the 24 h Holter monitoring that was not identified on ECG [24]. A high prevalence and changes between baseline ECG and follow-up Holter monitoring justified permanent pacemaker implantation in thirty percent of DM1 patients [25]. Current approach is to obtain 12-lead electrocardiogram each year and to consider prophylactic pacing in patients with more advanced conduction disturbances such as right bundle branch block associated with left fascicular block or bundle branch block with significant increase in PR interval, especially if there is evidence of worsening conduction over time [26]. Prophylactically inserted pacemaker in DM1 patients with HV interval of ≥70 ms even in the absence of related symptoms was monitored after implantation and was found out to have paroxysmal arrhythmias in 83.7% consisting of complete AV block, sinoatrial block, or atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias; thus a pacemaker including detailed diagnostic functions facilitates the diagnosis and management of frequent paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias that may remain obscure during conventional clinical surveillance [27]. Heart failure with a documented left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50 percent should be treated with current medical treatment including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, aldosterone-antagonists, and diuretics [9].The timing of pacemaker implantation in Steinert’s disease (DM1) should be individualized and tailored from the patient’s presentation considering in the background the current clinical practice guideline’s recommendation.The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.
Takotsubo Syndrome: A Pathway through the Pituitary Disease
1Hospital Santa Maria, Cardiology Department, Lisbon Academic Medical Centre, CCUL, Lisbon,  Portugal2Hospital de Santa Maria, Avenida Professor Egas Moniz, 1649-035 Lisboa,  PortugalReceived 24 November 2015; Accepted 2 February 2016Academic Editor: Man-Hong JimCopyright © 2016 Rui Plácido et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is characterized by reversible left ventricular apical and/or midventricular hypokinesia with unknown etiology. The clinical presentation is similar to acute myocardial infarction in the absence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Various predisposing factors have been related to TTC, such as acute neurological illnesses, endocrine diseases, pain, and emotional stress. We present the first description of an association between TTC cardiomyopathy and panhypopituitarism. This case reinforces the connection between the hormonal and cardiovascular systems. Furthermore, it supports the importance of a comprehensive and integrated medical history in the approach of a patient with cardiac disease, towards clinical decision-making.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a novel cardiomyopathy that has been firstly described by Sato et al. [1] as an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. The presenting features of TTC are similar to those of myocardial ischemia after acute plaque rupture, but the characteristic distinctions are regional wall motion abnormalities that extend beyond a single coronary vascular bed and the absence of epicardial coronary occlusion. A preceding emotional or physical stressor is common [2]. The presentation can include life-threatening symptoms and hemodynamic compromise. Recently a substantial rate of death and complications after the acute phase of TTC was shown, with a long-term follow-up revealing a significant rate of death from any cause (5.6% per patient-year) and a rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (9.9% per patient-year) [2].Marked increased levels of catecholamines and metanephrines are found in the acute phase and they probably account for a possible acute coronary spasm and/or focal myocardial dysfunction with contraction band necrosis/myocytolysis underlying the clinical condition [3]. Since the prognosis is much better and a different pharmacologic approach is required, angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are preferred [2], while inotropes should be avoided; the differential diagnosis is crucial [4]. Little is known about individual susceptibility to TTC. However increased sympathetic autonomic activity might be casually related. More rarely it may be related to a diseased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), probably requiring chronic increased compensatory hyperactivity of the sympathetic autonomic system [5]. We report a clinical case supporting that association.A 74-year-old man presented at the emergency department with chest pain, palpitations, and progressive dyspnea within the last 24 hours. He had a past history of high blood pressure and dyslipidemia and was being treated with lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide and simvastatin; an acquired atrioventricular block was managed with DDDR pacing. In the last year, fatigue, asthenia, adynamia, cold intolerance, loss of muscular strength, anorexia, decreased libido, and loss of male hair pattern distribution were also reported, with blood pressure decreasing whereat lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide was interrupted. On physical examination, blood pressure was 102/84 mmHg, heart rate 65 beats per minute, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and normal oxygen saturation (ambient air) and temperature 36.6°C. He had signs of heart failure (jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, and pulmonary congestion) and cardiac auscultation was remarkable for a protodiastolic gallop.Electrocardiogram showed an atrioventricular sequential paced rhythm with left bundle branch block morphology complexes, no ST-segment deviation, deeply inverted T waves on DI, aVL and precordial leads, and a prolonged QTc interval (560 ms) (Figure 1(a)). Complete blood count, serum electrolytes, renal function parameters, and glycaemia were normal. Troponin I (<0.07 ng/mL) was mildly elevated (0.79 ng/mL). Echocardiography showed a nondilated left ventricle with apical dyskinesia and hyperdynamic basal contraction assuming a systolic ballooning pattern, and a moderately depressed (37%) ejection fraction (Figure 2(a); Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/9219018).Acute coronary syndrome and TTC were considered in the differential diagnosis. Coronarography showing no significant coronary artery disease and a left ventriculogram revealing the typical apical ballooning (Figure 2(b); Video 2) favor the former hypothesis. Cardiac magnetic resonance was not performed given the presence of a noncompatible pacemaker.During hospitalization the patient was managed with diuretics, beta-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Laboratory data showed a peak troponin I of 1,38 ng/mL. Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma was excluded by urinary meta- and normetanephrines measurement (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) and the patient was referred for endocrine consultation.A formal pituitary dynamic test was performed after an overnight fast: growth hormone-releasing hormone 100 μg, corticotropin-releasing hormone 100 μg, thyrotropin-releasing hormone 200 μg, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone 100 μg bolus (intravenous) at time 0; baseline/peak hormone levels were as follows: growth hormone (<2 ng/mL): 0.15/0.18; prolactin (2–18 ng/mL): 21/35; cortisol (4–23 μg/dL): 1.5/4.1; follicle-stimulating hormone (1–18 U/L): 2.2/2.8; luteinizing hormone (3–35 U/L): 0.3/1.1; other baseline values were insulin-like growth factor 1 (48–188 ng/mL): 33; adrenocorticotropin (0–46 pg/mL): 31; triiodothyronine (60–181 ng/dL): 81; thyroxine (4.5–10.9 μg/dL): 2.2; free thyroxine (0.89–1.80 ng/dL): 0.42; total testosterone (188–772 ng/dL): <10. All measurements were obtained with standardized chemiluminescence immunoassays; age and gender specific reference values at 8.00–10.00 h am after an overnight fast are presented within square brackets. Thyroid autoantibodies were negative.Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a normal sized and positioned pituitary gland with no morphological abnormalities and a centered pituitary stalk.A diagnosis of idiopathic panhypopituitarism was established and the patient was prescribed hydrocortisone  mg daily (oral), levothyroxine 100 μg daily (oral), and testosterone enanthate 250 mg every fortnight (intramuscular). The usual instructions were given orally and by writing regarding stressful conditions.After 3 months of optimized heart failure treatment the patient showed clinical improvement, normalization of left ventricular function, and reversibility of T waves changes and QT prolongation (Figure 1(b)). Interestingly, in this case, the repolarization changes were clearly interpretable notwithstanding the presence of a right ventricular paced rhythm. In that time, lost weight was recovered and the patient regained normal physical vigour without other complaints.This case begins with an unusual presentation of TTC. There was no record for any particular acute emotional or physical stress; the patient is male while TTC is much more common in women and the presentation is that of an acute coronary syndrome with marked left ventricular dysfunction [3, 6].TTC is an acute, reversible dysfunction of the left ventricle in the absence of significant obstructive coronary disease. Recently, Templin et al. [2] prospectively showed that the most common pattern was the apical type (81.7%) followed by the midventricular (14.6%), the basal (2.2%), and the focal (1.5%) types. The condition is especially prevalent in postmenopausal women but the true prevalence of TTC remains uncertain because of its underrecognition. The long-term prognosis is generally favorable. The pathophysiology of TTC is not established but is likely multifactorial, involving the vascular, endocrine, and central nervous systems. Several mechanisms have been postulated to link the sympathetic hyperactivity and myocardial dysfunction including diffuse coronary artery spasm, coronary microcirculation alterations, and direct catecholamine mediated myocyte injury [3, 7]. In 70% of the documented cases there is an apparent trigger leading to catecholamine-induced myocardial injury [6]. Further investigation is needed to define the connection between these triggers and their effect on the vulnerable myocardium.In the acute phase, TTC is sometimes indistinguishable from acute myocardial infarction with respect to clinical symptoms, ECG changes, and cardiac biomarkers such as troponin and creatine kinase. Fast and accurate diagnosis on admission remains challenging, and exclusion of significant obstructive coronary artery disease is mandatory. Thus, there is a need for sensitive and specific biomarkers for the early diagnosis of TTC. MicroRNAs are a class of highly conserved and small noncoding posttranscriptional regulators of diverse cellular processes that have been recently considered as biomarkers in cardiovascular disease [8]. Jaguszewski et al. [9] recently described a signature of circulating microRNAs for sensitive and specific identification of TTC in the acute phase. The significant upregulation of stress- and depression-related microRNAs suggested a role of central and/or peripheral nervous system in TTC.Retrospectively the patient of our case presented complains suggesting pituitary failure—low blood pressure, cold intolerance, loss of physical vigour and motivation, decreased libido, scanty body hair—although this is a rare condition, and these symptoms are by themselves rather common in older men [7]. Endocrine evaluation unequivocally revealed complete anterior pituitary failure, but the reason is not apparent. Combined pituitary failure by itself is a very rare condition—estimated prevalence 46/100.000 and estimated annual incidence 4/100.000—and at least in adult/old patients most commonly depends on pituitary tumors [10, 11]. Other less common causes include head trauma [12], for which the patient had no recollection and besides pituitary stalk section generally occurs; hemochromatosis and other metabolic conditions, for which no evidence was found in this case (iron, transferrin, and ferritin levels were normal and the pituitary was not enlarged); vascular, that would be likely in this age group, namely, subarachnoid, hemorrhage [13]. However, there was no evidence for pituitary apoplexy at the CT scan. In fact most other conditions leading to combined pituitary failure, namely, infections, inflammatory, granulomatous, immune, or neoplastic disorders, generally present with structural abnormalities in the pituitary gland that can be shown by MRI [7, 10, 11]. Of course a congenital or genetic and functional defect is mostly unlikely, given patient age and clear evidence for previous normal growth and development, including two fathered children. In short, unequivocal combined pituitary failure is present but the reason is unclear. This occurs in around 10–20% of the cases, and an etiology sometimes is apparent only many years later [14]. An acute and transient defect is also unlikely since the patient had previous evidence of pituitary failure and maintained that condition for as long as two years of follow-up requiring substitutive therapy. Also, the possibility of a neuroendocrine adaptation to an acute/chronic condition may be discarded. That adaptation, for which the nonthyroidal patient syndrome is the best-known pattern, is associated with increased cortisol levels [15]. By the same token, a drug effect is unlikely.Besides some perplexing features, a most interesting point can be made that progressive multiple pituitary failure may require an increased sustained sympathetic activity to cope with daily life physical and emotional challenges, since it is by itself certainly a stressful condition. Curiously enough, to our knowledge, other reports of TTC and endocrine disease always resolve around the theme of pheochromocytoma [16] or failure of the HPA axis [5, 17, 18]; to our knowledge, this is the first report of the association of TTC with adult onset multiple pituitary hormonal failure. Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system may on the other hand favor the development of TTC, as has been suggested by some reports regarding behavioral medicine [3]. Regarding combined pituitary failure, increased sympathetic drive may be particularly deleterious, since androgens may downregulate the stress response and may present direct vasodilator effects on coronary arteries [19], and low testosterone predicts the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events [20] while glucocorticoids may play a supportive role on myocardial function [21] and hypothyroidism may impair coronary blood flow [22].TTC represents an acute heart failure syndrome that is associated with a substantial risk for adverse events. The great variety of triggering factors in this disease needs to be illuminated and new investigations are required. Furthermore, a heightened vigilance in the treatment of these patients is crucial to improve prognosis.In a way, the gap is narrowing between “Voodoo death” [23] as described by Sir Cannon in the 40s and TTC reported in the 90s. It remains to be seen if this association of combined pituitary failure and TTC is also reported by other authors. TTC by itself was also a long present but unknown condition until Sato first formally described it.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Coronary Thrombosis without Dissection following Blunt Trauma

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Blunt trauma to the chest resulting in coronary thrombosis and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a rare but well-described occurrence in adults. Angiography in such cases has generally disclosed complete epicardial coronary occlusion with thrombus, indistinguishable from the findings commonly found in spontaneous plaque rupture due to atherosclerotic disease. In all previously reported cases in which coronary interrogation with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed in association with acute revascularization, coronary artery dissection was implicated as the etiology of coronary thrombosis. We present the first case report of blunt trauma-associated coronary thrombosis without underlying atherosclerosis or coronary dissection, as documented by IVUS imaging.Cardiac injury is an uncommon complication of blunt trauma; in most cases of cardiac dysfunction following blunt trauma injury, cardiac contusion is implicated. Arrhythmic death has been reported in children following blunt force injuries to the chest. In rare cases, coronary thrombosis and STEMI have been associated with blunt trauma to the chest in adults [1–3]. Angiography in such cases has generally disclosed complete epicardial coronary occlusion with thrombus, indistinguishable from the findings commonly found in spontaneous plaque rupture due to atherosclerotic disease [1–3]. In all previously reported cases in which coronary interrogation with IVUS was performed in association with acute revascularization, coronary artery dissection was implicated as the etiology of coronary thrombosis [4–8]. We present the first case report of blunt trauma-associated coronary thrombosis without underlying atherosclerosis or coronary dissection, as documented by IVUS imaging performed at the time of primary percutaneous revascularization.A 25-year-old previously healthy woman presented to the Emergency Department after sustaining a kick to her lower chest by a horse. She initially complained of epigastric pain and nausea; she also reported substernal chest discomfort that became progressively more prominent. She had no coronary atherosclerotic risk factors and did not use oral contraceptives. She had stable vital signs; physical examination was notable only for abrasions of the chest wall. An ECG revealed sinus bradycardia at 56 beats/min with ST segment elevation in leads V1, V2, and aVL and ST segment depressions in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 (Figure 1). CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis disclosed a small left pneumothorax, focal myocardial hypoattenuation suggesting the possibility of cardiac contusion, and soft tissue attenuation of the subhepatic porta hepatis indicating hemorrhage. An echocardiogram demonstrated severe hypokinesis of the mid and distal anteroseptal segments and the apex, with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%. The aortic root was without evidence of dissection; there was no pericardial fluid or aortic valvular insufficiency. Because of the ECG and echo findings, emergent cardiac catheterization was performed. Coronary angiography via the right radial artery disclosed a total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery 2 mm from its origin (Figure 2(a)). All other epicardial vessels appeared to be normal. Antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapies with aspirin, clopidogrel, and bivalirudin were administered. A coronary wire was passed to the distal LAD, and balloon dilation with an undersized 2.5 mm balloon was performed, restoring normal antegrade flow. IVUS was then performed. Thrombus was evident adherent to the vessel wall in the proximal LAD. No dissection or atherosclerotic plaque was present (Figure 3/Video in Supplementary Material, available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/8671015). A 4.0 × 23 mm everolimus-eluting stent was deployed across the site of total occlusion (Figure 2(b)). Repeat IVUS imaging disclosed a lack of full stent apposition, and postdilation was performed with a 4.5 mm noncompliant balloon. Following PCI, antegrade flow was normal. CT angiography disclosed no evidence of aortic dissection. The patient exhibited mild pulmonary congestion on the following day that responded to diuretic therapy. Maximum serum troponin I level was 69.1 ng/mL. Hypercoagulability evaluation, including homocysteine, anti-nuclear antibody screen, antithrombin III, protein C, free and total protein S, protein S activity, Factor V Leiden mutation analysis, prothrombin 20210GA mutation, lupus anticoagulant profile, and anticardiolipin antibody, was negative. She was discharged on the 5th hospital day. Repeat echocardiography 2 weeks after her initial injury showed improvement in LV function, with residual mild to moderate hypokinesis of the mid to apical anterior wall and an ejection fraction of 50%.A wide variety of cardiovascular pathologies have been associated with blunt trauma injury, including myocardial contusion, aortic transection or less often aortic dissection, trauma-induced ventricular arrhythmia or commotio cordis in young children [9], hemopericardium with tamponade, and aortic valve leaflet avulsion [10–12]. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a rare but well-described complication of blunt trauma to the chest. Since the advent of primary percutaneous intervention, there have been several reports of AMI due to total epicardial thrombotic occlusion following blunt trauma and its successful treatment by percutaneous intervention [13–17]. Proposed mechanisms for AMI in this setting have included intimal injury due to shear forces imparted by the blunt trauma [18, 19], plaque rupture, coronary artery dissection, and coronary vasospasm [20]. In several reports, the presence of coronary artery dissection has been documented as the underlying pathophysiologic trigger for thrombosis [4–8]. In recent years, IVUS has become an increasingly routine adjunctive imaging modality in coronary revascularization. For a 40 MHz IVUS transducer the typical resolution is 80–100 microns axially and 200–250 microns laterally [21]. IVUS is extremely sensitive for the detection of coronary disease involving the vessel wall, including the presence of underlying atherosclerosis or dissection. All previous reports of blunt trauma-associated acute STEMI that included IVUS interrogation of the occluded epicardial vessel have identified the presence of a coronary dissection as the underlying pathophysiologic substrate triggering thrombosis. Coronary dissection presumably occurs in association with deceleration trauma, in some cases involving the aorta. It is not known whether affected individuals carry a genetic predisposition to vascular dissection; however, spontaneous coronary dissection has been associated with fibromuscular dysplasia [22]. The mechanism of thrombosis in the case presented here remains obscure. Acute psychological stress has been implicated in AMI, following diverse stressors, including earthquakes [23], missile attacks [24], and international soccer matches [25], but these primarily involved patients having underlying atherosclerotic disease, whereas the patient in the current case was a 25-year-old female with no coronary risk factors and no atherosclerosis by angiography or by IVUS interrogation of the vessel wall. It appears most likely that thrombosis in this case was the result of endothelial injury, possibly caused by direct compression of the proximal left anterior descending artery by the force of the blow or via shock waves [26]. A mathematical model for blunt injury leading to hemodynamic shade zone formation with high and low shear stress and hyperviscosity has been developed by Ismailov [27]. In addition, the presence of an underlying subclinical thrombophilic state that might interact with such an injury to produce thrombosis cannot be excluded. Park et al. demonstrated that patients with blunt trauma have greater numbers of circulating procoagulant microparticle and increased in vitro thrombin generation that correlated with injury severity despite normal values for standard clotting assays. Response to injury though appears to be variable between individuals [28].The treatment approach to myocardial infarction (STEMI) following blunt chest trauma is immediate coronary angiography and revascularization with percutaneous intervention and continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy. We felt that use of GpIIb/IIIa inhibitor was contraindicated in our patient because of liver laceration and increased risk of bleeding.In conclusion, we present a case of proximal left anterior descending artery thrombosis precipitated by blunt force trauma to the chest in a 25-year-old woman with no history or risk factors for coronary disease and with no associated atherosclerosis or coronary artery dissection. The patient was successfully treated by primary PCI. Although significant chest pain would not be unexpected following severe blunt trauma injury to the chest, the possibility that ongoing pain represents myocardial ischemia should be considered, and a screening ECG should be considered to identify rare cases of STEMI.The authors report no financial relationships or conflict of interests regarding the content herein.
Pulmonary Hypertension Secondary to Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return in an Elderly
University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85714,  USAReceived 25 October 2015; Accepted 27 December 2015Academic Editor: Ramazan AkdemirCopyright © 2016 Stefan Koester et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Background. Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) is an uncommon congenital abnormality, which may present in the adult population. It is often associated with sinus venosus defect (SVD). The diagnosis and therapy for this condition may be challenging. Case Presentation. We describe a case of an elderly woman who presented with NYHA Class IV dyspnea and was suspected to have symptomatic pulmonary hypertension. She was later found to have anomalous right upper pulmonary vein return to the superior vena cava and associated SVD with bidirectional shunting. Therapeutic options were discussed and medical management alone with aggressive diuresis and sildenafil was adopted. Follow-up visits revealed success in the planned medical therapy. Conclusions. PAPVR is a rare congenital condition that may present during late adulthood. The initial predominant left-to-right shunting associated with this anomaly may go undetected for years with the gradual development of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure due to right heart volume overload. Awareness of the condition is important, as therapy is time-sensitive with early detection potentially leading to surgical therapy as a viable option.Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) is an uncommon congenital abnormality, which may present in the adult population. We describe a case of an elderly woman who presented with symptomatic pulmonary hypertension and was found to have PAPVR associated with sinus venosus defect (SVD). We also discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges encountered.A 77-year-old Hispanic lady with a history of asthma and elevated pulmonary pressures attributed to respiratory disease presented with increased dyspnea at rest and worsening lower extremity swelling over a week. Prior to this, she had been independent and was able to walk without symptoms. Her past medical history was otherwise significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism. Her home medications included albuterol, amlodipine, levothyroxine, loratadine, and metoprolol. She was not a smoker and consumed no alcohol. Systems review was otherwise unremarkable.Physical exam showed an irregular rhythm with a rate in the 130 s. Blood pressure was 147/88 mmHg; she was afebrile, tachypneic with O2 sats. of 93%. She was a thin, elderly woman who was alert and cooperative. Her JVP was elevated at 15 cm H2O. She had mild, diffuse wheezing bilaterally with bibasal fine, inspiratory crackles. Heart sounds were present with fixed splitting of the second heart sounds and a 2/6 pan-systolic murmur in the right parasternal base. Abdomen was soft and nontender. She had 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema.A 12-lead ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 133 bpm. A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and prominence of the pulmonary arteries with a small right pleural effusion.Lab tests including a complete blood count and complete-metabolic panel were unremarkable. Troponin was borderline elevated and B-type Natriuretic Peptide was moderately elevated at 626 pg/mL. TSH was normal.A chest CT with pulmonary angiography showed no pulmonary emboli. There was right heart cardiomegaly and dilation of the main pulmonary artery with calcifications seen in the proximal pulmonary arteries (Figures 1 and 2). Small bilateral pleural effusions were noted. A possible anomalous right upper pulmonary vein to lateral superior vena cava just above the right atrium to superior vena cava junction was also seen (Figure 3), with a possible associated interatrial septal defect. Compression ultrasonography with Doppler flow study revealed a nonocclusive deep venous thrombosis that was seen in the mid right superficial femoral vein.Transthoracic echo showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45%. The right heart was severely dilated with severe reduction in systolic function associated with systolic and diastolic ventricular septal flattening (Figure 4). Moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation were noted with right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) estimated at 50 mmHg + CVP. Her IVC was dilated with minimal inspiratory change. Severe, resting right-to-left shunting was seen with saline bubble study.Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guided cardioversion was performed. The TEE confirmed a sinus venosus (SV) atrial septal defect measuring 3.1 cm in maximum diameter (Figure 5). No left atrial appendage thrombus was seen. The right upper anomalous pulmonary venous return to the SVC was seen with no additional anomalous venous drainage. She was successfully cardioverted. Following atrial fibrillation cardioversion, her LVEF normalized with persistent right heart dilatation.Right heart cardiac catheterization was performed with inhaled nitric oxide reactivity testing after several additional days of diuresis, initiation of digoxin, and the commencement of oral sildenafil. This showed a normal CVP of 2 mmHg, left atrial pressure of 6 mmHg, high-flow pulmonary hypertension of 74/15, and mean 37 mmHg. Pulmonary cardiac output was 12.5 L/min with systemic cardiac output of 8.7 L/min, resulting in a  of 1.4. Effective cardiac output was 5.1 L/min. Pulmonary vascular resistance was minimally elevated at 2.3 Wood units. Bidirectional shunting was present with predominant left to right shunt of 60% and right to left shunt of 40%. She had no significant response with inhaled nitric oxide and her systemic oxygen saturation corrected on a 100% O2 nonrebreather.Initial anticoagulation with iv heparin and warfarin was initiated for the DVT, which also prepared her for TEE-guided cardioversion. Rate control of her atrial fibrillation was initially achieved with oral digoxin. Beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were not used secondary to her severe right heart failure. Oral sildenafil was initiated at this point at the recommendation of the pulmonary hypertension service. Aggressive IV diuresis was initiated.After several days of initial stabilization, she was then scheduled for a TEE. This showed no left atrial appendage thrombus, and she was loaded with iv amiodarone. Elective biphasic cardioversion of her atrial fibrillation was performed. Two liters/min of home oxygen supplementation was started.She improved over the course of therapy from NYHA Class IV symptoms to NYHA Class II symptoms by discharge. On follow-up in pulmonary hypertension clinic a month later, she remained symptomatically improved with good INR follow-up and atrial fibrillation free.We describe a case of late clinical presentation of symptomatic pulmonary hypertension secondary to PAPVR and a SVD with bidirectional shunting. PAPVC is a rare congenital heart disease, with a prevalence of 0.1 to 0.2% in the adult population [1, 2]. Anomalous right sided pulmonary veins could return to the right atrium, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, azygos vein, hepatic vein, or portal vein. Anomalous left sided pulmonary veins might drain into the innominate vein, coronary sinus, and hemiazygos vein. Studies based on the pediatric population identified the most common form of PAPVR to be the right upper pulmonary vein connecting to the SVC which is most often associated with a SVD [3]. Interestingly, retrospective reviews of adults receiving CT imaging identified that only half of the anomalies were right sided, with the only case of right upper lobe PAPVR being associated with atrial septal defect [2]. This may be an indication that the pediatric and adult populations with PAPVR may be significantly different. Our patient was found to have PAPVR associated with right upper anomalous pulmonary venous return to the SVC with associated SVD.In PAPVR, the persistent systemic venous connection acts similarly to a left-to-right shunt, where a portion of the right ventricular output is continuously recirculated and oxygenated blood is returned to the right heart without traveling to the systemic circulation. The initial predominance of left-to-right shunting causes the condition to be clinically undetected. Over time, the increase in pulmonary blood flow can lead to progressive remodelling of the pulmonary circulation and increased pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension [4]. This leads to gradual negative right heart remodelling occurring over the years due to right heart volume overload. As volume related pulmonary hypertension develops, severe tricuspid regurgitation often occurs associated with right atrial arrhythmias which may lead to sudden clinical decompensation. Over time, worse right failure occurs and may lead to reversal of the bidirectional shunting into predominant right-to-left shunting, systemic cyanosis and Eisenmenger’s syndrome.The diagnosis of PAPVC is challenging. The typical presenting clinical features such as shortness of breath, right heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension are not specific to PAPVC. Therefore, patients may be misdiagnosed initially as having primary pulmonary hypertension [5]. In our patient, diagnosis was made after CT pulmonary angiogram was performed to exclude thromboembolic disease (Figures 1, 2, and 3). This is similar to other cases where PAPVR was diagnosed following CT-angiogram to exclude pulmonary embolism [6, 7].Awareness of the condition is important, as early recognition can lead to successful surgical correction which involves surgical redirection of the anomalous vein into the left atrium [8]. In our patient, her severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance preclude her as a good surgical candidate. It is not likely that surgery is going to alter the disease course, as the extensive vascular remodelling is unlikely to be reversible. Catheter embolization of the anomalous vein was also considered. However, this was not a viable option in our patient as there was no concomitant connection from the anomalous vein to the left atrium, which can accommodate the venous drainage after the anomalous vein has been embolized [9]. In our patient, given her high surgical risk, medical therapy alone was adopted. There have been small retrospective and observational studies of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to congenital heart diseases, including PAPVR, having clinical and hemodynamic improvements with prostaglandins, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and bosentan [10]. However, close monitoring of response to treatment is important in the event that the pulmonary hypertension progresses.In conclusion, PAPVR is a rare congenital condition that may present during late adulthood. The predominant left-to-right shunting associated with this anomaly can go undetected for years with the gradual development of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure due to right heart volume overload. There should be a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with unexplained pulmonary hypertension. Awareness of the condition is important, as therapy is time-sensitive with early detection potentially leading to surgical therapy as a viable option.Dr. Kwan Lee receives honoraries from St. Jude Medical and Maquet Medical Systems.

The cardiotoxic manifestations like acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure, or arrhythmia related to misuse of amphetamine and its synthetic derivatives have been documented but are rather rare. Amphetamine-related AMI is even rarer. We report two cases of men who came to emergency department (ED) with chest pain, palpitation, or seizure and were subsequently found to have myocardial infarction associated with the use of amphetamines. It is crucial that, with increase in amphetamine abuse, clinicians are aware of this potentially dire complication. Patients with low to intermediate risk for coronary artery disease with atypical presentation may benefit from obtaining detailed substance abuse history and urine drug screen if deemed necessary.Amphetamine is a potent central nervous system stimulant and a substance of widespread abuse. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ranks amphetamine-type stimulants such as MDMA (popularly known as Ecstasy or Molly) and methamphetamine as the world’s second most widely used type of drug after cannabis [1]. According to the figures released by National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 1.4 million or 0.5 percent of individuals aged 12 years or older were nonmedical users of stimulants in 2013 [2]. The use of amphetamine appears to vary with gender and race. It is predominantly seen in unemployed single white men aged 20–35 years [3]. Data suggests that Caucasians use amphetamines more than African Americans [4]. The role of cocaine as a causative agent of AMI is well established [5, 6] but AMI due to amphetamine use or abuse has not been as widely recognized. Westover et al. showed modest, though statistically significant, association between amphetamine abuse and AMI in their population-based study [7]. The most popular amphetamines encountered in abuse include amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 4-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), and 4-methylthioamphetamine (4-MTA) [8]. We report two cases of previously healthy men who presented with atypical chest pain and palpitations to the ED and later were diagnosed with AMI associated with use of amphetamines.A 41-year-old African American male was brought to our ED with worsening constant, central, pleuritic chest pain of one-day duration that woke him from sleep. He also complained of nausea, tingling, and numbness of both hands. He reported a history of few weeks of intermittent chest pain in the same location, with no aggravating or relieving factors. His past medical history was significant for dyslipidemia. He denied prescription or illicit drug use but gave a remote history of smoking, alcohol, and marijuana abuse. He had no known drug allergy. His father passed away from a myocardial infarction at 66 years of age. On presentation to the ED his blood pressure was 107/60 mm Hg, heart rate was 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 16 per minute, and temperature was 97°F with an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. His lungs were clear to auscultation and his abdominal examination was within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia with diffuse ST segment elevation suggestive of early repolarization (Figure 1). His initial set of cardiac enzymes showed markedly elevated CPK of 2176 U/L, CK-MB of 55.5 ng/mL, troponin I of 2.22 ng/mL, and myoglobin of 467 ng/mL (Table 1). He was admitted to the cardiac unit for hemodynamic monitoring, serial serum cardiac enzymes levels assays, serial EKGs, and assessment of left ventricular function. The rest of his laboratory values are listed in Table 2. The urine drug screen was positive for amphetamines and negative for cocaine, opiates, barbiturates, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, and phencyclidine, methadone, and propoxyphene. Chest X-ray showed no acute pathology. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function without any regional wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac catheterization revealed normal epicardial coronary arteries without any evidence of atherosclerotic disease. Serum troponin levels showed a downward trend on follow-up lab tests. The patient was started on amlodipine 10 mg for possible coronary vasospasm. He was discharged home after two days of hospitalization. The final diagnosis of AMI likely secondary to amphetamine-induced vasospasm was made.A 23-year-old African American male was brought to our ED with a seizure episode preceded by palpitations and diaphoresis. He was on a rigorous exercise regimen and had started taking an over-the-counter product called Shakeology one week before. At the time of admission, his blood pressure was 101/64 mm Hg, heart rate was 154 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 18 per minute, and temperature was 98°F with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He denied prescription or illicit drug use but on the day of presentation he did drink some alcohol. He admitted to smoking two cigarettes per week and having a couple of beers on the weekend. His past medical history was unremarkable and he had no known drug allergies. There was no significant family history of any cardiac conditions. Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregularly irregular heart beat and the EKG showed atrial fibrillation without any significant ST changes (Figure 2(a)). His lungs were clear to auscultation and abdominal examination was within normal limits. His initial cardiac enzymes were elevated with CPK of 271 U/L, CK-MB of 29.4 ng/mL, troponin I of 1.73 ng/mL, and myoglobin of 79 ng/mL (Table 1). He was admitted to cardiac unit for further monitoring and management. Repeat EKG showed spontaneous conversion to normal sinus rhythm (Figure 2(b)). The rest of his laboratory values were normal (Table 2). Troponin I levels peaked at 9.57 ng/mL. No acute pathology was noted on chest X-ray. Cardiac CT angiogram with calcium scoring was done. It showed calcium score of 0 Agatston units and no evidence of coronary artery disease. The urine drug screen was positive for amphetamines and negative for cocaine, opiates, barbiturates, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, and phencyclidine, methadone, and propoxyphene. Coronary vasospasm likely secondary to amphetamine was considered possible etiology and he was started on amlodipine 10 mg. He was discharged home on fourth day after resolution of his symptoms. The final diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction likely secondary to amphetamine-induced vasospasm was made.Amphetamine is a synthetic derivative of phenethylamine. Amphetamines are central nervous system stimulants that stimulate the release of catecholamines especially norepinephrine and dopamine from presynaptic nerve endings and prevent their reuptake, thus creating a hyperadrenergic state [9]. Its history of abuse dates back to its development more than 100 years ago. The last twenty-five years have seen a rapid surge in illicit use of amphetamine and related compounds in the United States. The routes of administration can be oral, intravenous (IV), and inhalation. With oral use there is approximately 1-hour delay in symptoms, whereas when inhaled or injected effects are seen within few minutes. The peak plasma concentration is achieved in 5 minutes with IV use and in 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. The rate of metabolism is highly variable and up to 30% of the parent compound can be excreted unchanged in the urine. Plasma half-life ranges from 5 to 30 hours depending on urine flow and pH [10].The most common cardiovascular side effects of amphetamine abuse are hypertension and tachycardia [11]. Other common complaints can be chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath. There have been reports of serious cardiovascular complications like cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmia, myocardial infarction, cor pulmonale, myocarditis, necrotizing vasculitis, coronary rupture, and sudden cardiac arrest [11–14]. The exact pathophysiological mechanism of myocardial infarction following amphetamine use is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include coronary vasospasm, coronary spasm with intracoronary thrombus, prothrombotic activation [15, 16], increased myocardial oxygen demand induced by catecholamines [17], and catecholamine-mediated platelet aggregation with subsequent thrombus formation [18]. The role of amphetamine in inducing vasoconstriction and vasospasm is not completely explained by adrenergic stimulation [19].Our patients had no therapeutic indication for amphetamine-like substances and denied any recreational drug use. The exact route of intake could not be ascertained. 45% of the adults in a recent single centre study by Alghamdi et al. did not admit to substance abuse. Adults aged <40 years were more likely to admit to substance abuse [20]. Urine drug screens are generally performed using either immunoassays or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [21]. One major problem with immunoassays is false-positive results. Therefore, a more specific confirmatory test such as GC-MS is needed to confirm a positive finding with an immunoassay. GC-MS is more accurate than an immunoassay but it is more expensive and time-consuming [22]. Our patients were not on any drugs or dietary supplements that are known to cause false-positive immunoassay [23]. One of our limitations is absence of GC-MS urine drug screen or serum amphetamine levels for the patients.Patient 2 had history of consumption of a meal replacement shake (Shakeology). Popular dietary supplements are known to cause false-positive urine drug screen for amphetamine [23, 24] and also have been implicated in causing sudden cardiac death and AMI [25, 26]. Shakeology is not mentioned in the list of such dietary supplements released by the concerned agencies [27].Patient 1 had normal sinus rhythm with early repolarization and patients 2 had atrial fibrillation with nonspecific ST changes. Serial cardiac biomarkers were elevated in both patients. Liebetrau et al. proposed diagnostic approach for AMI in patients with atrial fibrillation and symptoms suggestive of AMI. The specificity-optimized cut-off values higher than the 99th percentile concentration (0.032 ng/mL) and additional use of the 3-hour change in troponin concentration lead to a positive predictive value of more than 95%, facilitating identification of patients with AMI [28]. Patient 2 had atrial fibrillation that lasted for few minutes and resolved spontaneously. The maximal noted heart rate was 154 beats per minute. He did not have any evidence of hypotension. His troponin I on presentation was 1.73 ng/mL and subsequently increased to 9.57 ng/mL four hours later. It does not seem plausible that atrial fibrillation that was transient and without any hemodynamic compromise would lead to greater than fivefold increase in troponin on subsequent testing.The treatment of AMI attributed to amphetamine abuse is not clearly defined [29, 30]. Calcium channel blockers may play an important role in the treatment of AMI due to amphetamines and as in our cases they may be effective in treatment of suspected coronary vasospasm. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocker administration should be avoided until the pathophysiology of this condition has been clarified as they may exacerbate coronary vasospasm. Thrombolytic therapy or intravenous anticoagulants may be used if coronary thrombus is present [19].Patient 1 had cardiac catheterization while Patient 2 had CT coronary angiography given his low risk for coronary artery disease. No evidence of coronary artery disease was found in either subject. Both patients had good outcome and were discharged home to follow-up in cardiology clinic.Amphetamine and related substances are now among the most commonly abused drugs worldwide. Amphetamine associated AMI may become more common in the acute care setting if the rate of amphetamine abuse continues to increase. Although the exact mechanism by which it does so is still unclear, there seems to be intricate interaction of host and drug factors that is responsible for the variability in clinical presentation and outcome. Clinically a number of areas need to be addressed, the most important being the appropriate therapeutic approach. Physicians working in the emergency departments as well as cardiologists should be sensitive to this complication, as early diagnosis can be the key to successful management of this potentially fatal complication.Patients’ consent was obtained for the publication.Bryan H.

Spontaneous Coronary Dissection: “Live Flash” Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Angioplasty
Hospital do Espirito Santo, Largo Senhor da Pobreza, 7000-811 Évora,  PortugalReceived 30 October 2015; Revised 23 January 2016; Accepted 27 January 2016Academic Editor: Assad MovahedCopyright © 2016 Angela Pimenta Bento et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Optical Coherence tomography (OCT) is a light-based imaging modality which shows tremendous potential in the setting of coronary imaging. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequent cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The diagnosis of SCAD is made mainly with invasive coronary angiography, although adjunctive imaging modalities such as computed tomography angiography, IVUS, and OCT may increase the diagnostic yield. The authors describe a clinical case of a young woman admitted with the diagnosis of ACS. The ACS was caused by SCAD detected in the coronary angiography and the angioplasty was guided by OCT. OCT use in the setting of SCAD has been already described and the true innovation in this case was this unique use of OCT. The guidance of angioplasty with live and short images was very useful as it allowed clearly identifying the position of the guidewires at any given moment without the use of prohibitive amounts of contrast.Optical Coherence tomography (OCT) is a light-based imaging modality which shows tremendous potential in the setting of coronary imaging. Compared to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), OCT has a tenfold higher image resolution. It has the ability to characterize the structure and extent of coronary disease with unprecedented detail as the various components of atherosclerotic plaques have different properties. In daily practice OCT is useful in guiding complex interventions. Image acquisition has some particularities because blood must be displaced during OCT imaging. In fact OCT images are obtained and recorded as the coronary artery is flushed with contrast and the catheter-imaging tip is pulled back (usually at 20 mm/s). Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequent cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) typically affecting a younger, otherwise healthy population. The population-based incidence of SCAD is unknown. Retrospective registry studies have reported SCAD detection in 0.07% to 1.1% of all coronary angiograms performed. Apparently there is a female preponderance and an association with peripartum or postpartum status. Other identified SCAD associations include connective tissue disorders, vasculitis, polycystic kidney disease, and exercise, suggesting an underlying vascular predisposition in some, although a unifying structural vessel wall abnormality has not yet been identified [1, 2]. The diagnosis of SCAD is made mainly with invasive coronary angiography, although adjunctive imaging modalities such as computed tomography angiography, IVUS, and OCT may increase the diagnostic yield [3]. OCT provides unique insights on the most relevant morphologic features of the condition including entry tear, intimomedial flap, double-lumen morphology, intramural hematoma, and associated thrombus [4]. The optimal treatment strategy for acute SCAD presentation remains undetermined and may vary according to the type and severity of presentation. Reports have demonstrated favorable outcomes with conservative management (with documented angiographic resolution), fibrinolysis, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Regardless of initial treatment strategy, in-hospital and early outcomes have in general been reported to be favorable.A 41-year-old female with obesity and polycystic kidney disease is referred to the cath lab after an episode of chest pain with troponin elevation one week after primary PCI in the context of inferior acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation. Angiography at the time revealed a balanced-dominant circulation, with TIMI flow 3 in the right coronary artery (RCA) without stenotic lesions and a subocclusive lesion in a small posterolateral branch (PLB) from the circumflex artery which was considered to be the culprit lesion. Balloon angioplasty was performed with good final result and TIMI 3 flow.In the present episode angiography showed persistent good result of the previous PCI, and total occlusion of the proximal RCA, that was suspected to be caused by spontaneous dissection because of the presence of haziness at the site of the occlusion and disappearance of several acute marginal branches as compared with the previous exam. We then decided to perform OCT (Terumo Lunawave® OFDI system) that clearly revealed the double-lumen morphology and also that the guidewire was in the false lumen (Figures 1 and 2). We then proceeded to angioplasty under OCT guidance. With live OCT images, without recording an actual pullback, we used small flushes of contrast until we were able to confirm that the guidewire was on the true lumen (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). The OCT could also identify entry tear very clearly (Figure 4). Once the true lumen was secured, we proceeded to angioplasty with a drug-eluting stent sealing the entry tear in the proximal right coronary artery (Figure 5). There was final TIMI 3 flow, and the acute marginal branches were again visible, but there was a narrowing in the distal vessel where the false lumen was still visible but showing signs of thrombosis (Figure 6). To avoid making a full metal jacket, we decided to accept this result and perform a control angiography one month later. After one uneventful month, follow-up angiography revealed persistence of a large dissection that extended to the distal vessel. There was an important compromise of the true lumen by the false lumen. Given the previous STEMI presentation and the negative angiographic evolution within a month, we carried out an OCT that confirmed the dissection and showed that the guidewire was now in the true lumen (Figures 7(a) and 7(b)). In this setting, we decided to seal the dissection with implantation of two more drug-eluting stents in the mid and distal RCA to guarantee the long-term patency of the vessel (Figure 8). There was residual dissection in the very distal segment, which was a small vessel.Diagnosis and management of SCAD is very challenging. However, an accurate and early diagnosis remains of paramount importance. There are few data concerning the utilization and value of OCT in this rare disease. In the case cited before, OCT was able to readily visualize the double-lumen morphology characteristic of this entity and to identify the entry tear and the circumferential nature and longitudinal extent of the disease. The compromise of the true lumen and the distribution of the false lumen were also clearly visualized. The low profile (catheter crossing profile: 2,6 Fr) and higher resolution (frame rate: 160 fps) of OCT were very useful in this case as they allowed obtaining high quality images of long segments of the artery. OCT is not, however, without potential harm. In a situation of a SCAD, it can further propagate the dissection and/or intimal tear, due to brisk intracoronary flow changes, so its use must take into account the potential benefit versus potential harm. Careful contrast injection speed is of paramount importance. In this case OCT was revealed to be particularly useful, since not only did it make it possible to correctly identify the dissection and intimal tear, it also made correct true lumen wiring possible, with live imaging during wire manipulation with a stationary OCT catheter. OCT usefulness in the setting of SCAD has already been reported, and the technique we describe in this case represents an innovation that may become even more interesting in the future, with OCT technical development. This technique opens a promising field for software development; for example, we think that it will be very useful to be able to also record images with a stationary OCT catheter and not only those obtained in the automated pullback with complete flush of the coronary artery. Another potential benefit of this technique (OCT) in SCAD setting is the possibility of doing 3D OCT online to improve the capability of identifying the entry tear. Regarding the angioplasty per se, we would have used bioresorbable scaffolds, were they available in our cath lab at the time of this procedure. In a more detailed analysis of the OCT images after the final procedure we realized that the entry tear was located behind the distal part of the previously implanted stent (Figure 7(b)). We now wonder if we could have sealed the dissection with just a balloon after dilatation.Spontaneous coronary artery disease is an intriguing entity, in which a conservative approach seems to be the best option whenever possible, due to procedural complications. OCT can be decisive for correct diagnosis, planning, treatment, and optimization of PCI in SCAD.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Staphylococcus aureus Endocarditis with Multivalvular Involvement Secondary to an Atrial Septal Defect
Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center, Temple University, 1086 Franklin Street, Johnstown, PA 15905,  USAReceived 10 November 2015; Accepted 24 January 2016Academic Editor: Hajime KataokaCopyright © 2016 Vistasp Jimmy  Daruwalla et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Infective endocarditis is usually diagnosed using modified Duke’s criteria. Our patient had a subacute presentation and a low suspicion for endocarditis during admission, unfortunately leading to her death. Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic measures including antibiotic therapy and surgical techniques, morbidity and mortality with staphylococcal infective endocarditis remain high. Hence, we stress the significance of having a low threshold for TEE in patients with multisystem involvement due to Staphylococcus aureus that have evidence of persistent infection despite antibiotic treatment, even if the suspicion for endocarditis is low based on Duke’s criteria. TEE substantially improves the sensitivity of diagnosis but may not be readily available in many medical centers. Presence of an ASD has been noted to have increased the risk of left sided endocarditis even with conditions that predispose to right sided endocarditis, particularly in patients with hemodialysis and diabetes as morbid risk factors.Infective endocarditis is a serious condition with a high mortality of 15 to 20%. Early diagnosis based on modified Duke’s criteria involving a combination of clinical, microbiological, and imaging information is important [1]. Patients on hemodialysis are at increased risk of bacterial infections, particularly Staphylococcus aureus. Infective endocarditis can be a complication in up to 25% of these cases [2]. We report a case of culture negative, subacute infective endocarditis in a patient on hemodialysis, who also had an atrial septal defect (ASD), complicating the presentation.A 56-year-old female presented with a history of few days of generalized weakness and subjective fever. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, depression, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis via left AV fistula. Patient also complained of some urinary discomfort, nausea, and mild generalized abdominal pain but denied any chest pain or shortness of breath. She was afebrile with stable vital signs. Physical examination was significant for a widely split S2 and mild left costovertebral tenderness. Laboratory findings showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.5 gm/dL, WBC count of 24,000/cumm, and abnormal urine analysis, with +2 bacteria and significant proteinuria. A presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection was made and she was started on ceftriaxone for antibiotic coverage while awaiting urine and blood culture results.Over the next 4 days, she became hypotensive and continued to have generalized fatigue with blood cultures negative for any growth. On day 5 there was pus drainage from the AV fistula access site during her dialysis. CT scan of her left upper extremity showed a small abscess with associated skin thickening and a poorly defined fluid collection at the site of her AV fistula. Surgical drainage was performed and pus culture subsequently grew rare colonies of Staphylococcus aureus. Patient was started on vancomycin and gentamycin for a broader empirical coverage. CT scan of her chest revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with an infectious or inflammatory process, highly suggestive of multiple septic emboli.She continued to have persistent fatigue and markedly elevated ESR of over 140 mm/hr despite antibiotic treatment. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed, which showed a large vegetation (1.9 cm × 0.7 cm) located on the atrial aspect of the posterior mitral leaflet (Figure 1). The tricuspid valve demonstrated a fairly large (1.46 cm × 1.38 cm) vegetation, attached to the atrial aspect of the valve (Figure 2). Interatrial septum showed a large septum secundum type ASD measuring about 2.6 cm to 2.8 cm in diameter with color flow evidence of significant left to right shunt and intermittent right to left shunt across it (Figure 3). The Qp/Qs ratio was 1.56, indicating a significant shunt. A transthoracic echocardiogram 2 years ago showed normal structure of mitral and tricuspid valves with mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac catheterization showed severe disease of the left circumflex and right coronary artery. Patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting along with closure of a large atrial septal defect with a bovine pericardium patch, mitral valve replacement with a tissue prosthesis, and tricuspid valve repair. Patient was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit and was extubated the next day. Unfortunately the patient succumbed to sepsis and died.Staphylococcus aureus is a very virulent pathogen causing wide range of infections from benign soft tissue to lethal infective endocarditis, septic embolism, and toxic shock syndrome. Staphylococcus endocarditis is a critical illness with an overall mortality of 22–34%. The primary factor contributing to mortality is frequent delay in diagnosis and treatment due to the nonspecific nature of the symptoms [3].The clinical presentation of this patient was intriguing as she had a low suspicion for endocarditis at admission, based on the modified Duke’s criteria; she was afebrile and had multiple negative blood cultures. This is an unusual presentation for Staphylococcus aureus, which typically presents with acute endocarditis leading to significant damage of the valve. In our patient, infection at multiple sites, persistent symptoms, and markedly elevated ESR despite prompt antibiotic treatment subsequently raised the suspicion for endocarditis. It is likely that our patient had AV fistula site infection that spread to the tricuspid valve, which resulted in septic pulmonary emboli and seeding of the mitral valve across the large ASD.Our case highlights a few important issues about Staphylococcus aureus infection in dialysis patients. Firstly, these patients may have an atypical presentation. Secondly applying modified Duke’s criteria to determine the pretest probability for endocarditis, as a means to trigger an echocardiogram, may not be very sensitive in these patients; our patient did not have enough clinical suspicion for endocarditis initially, to trigger an echocardiogram. Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic measures, including antibiotic therapy and surgical techniques, morbidity and mortality with staphylococcal infective endocarditis remain high, with around 20% in hospital mortality and 27% at six months [4]. Hence, it is very reasonable to have a low threshold to perform an early TEE in patients with Staphylococcus aureus infection, who are at high risk for multisystem involvement.The authors do not have any conflict of interests.
Tender Endothelium Syndrome: Combination of Hypotension, Bradycardia, Contrast Induced Chest Pain, and Microvascular Angina
1Department of Internal Medicine, Queens University, Kingston General Hospital, 76 Stuart Street, Kingston, ON, Canada  K7L 2V72Department of Cardiology, McMaster University, St. Catharines Hospital, 1200 4th Avenue, St. Catharines, ON, Canada  L2S 0A9Received 11 November 2015; Revised 14 January 2016; Accepted 17 January 2016Academic Editor: Kjell NikusCopyright © 2016 Shivesh Goberdhan et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Hypotension, bradycardia, and contrast induced chest pain are potential complications of cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. Catheter-induced coronary spasm has been occasionally demonstrated, but its relationship to spontaneous coronary spasm is unclear. We describe a 64-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery in 1998 on the basis of an angiographic diagnosis of severe left main disease, who recently presented with increasingly frequent typical angina. Repeat coronary angiography was immediately complicated by severe chest pain, hypotension, and bradycardia but demonstrated only mild disease of the left main artery and entire coronary tree with complete occlusion of her prior grafts. This reaction was almost identical to that observed during her original coronary angiogram. We now believe her original angiogram was complicated by severe catheter-induced left main spasm, with the accompanying contrast reaction attributed to left main disease, and the occlusion of coronary grafts explained by the absence of significant left main disease. The combination of these symptoms has not been documented in the literature. In this instance, these manifestations erroneously led to coronary bypass surgery. It is unknown whether routine, systematic injection of intracoronary nitroglycerin prior to angiography might blunt the severity of such reactions.Typical angina is defined by three features: substernal location chest discomfort, provocation by exertion or emotional stress, and relief by rest or nitroglycerin. When only two of the above criteria are met, atypical angina is suggested, while the presence of only one feature suggests noncardiac chest pain [1]. Epicardial coronary artery spasm also manifests as substernal chest pain but usually lacks a clear association with exertion and can be difficult to diagnose due to the fleeting nature of symptoms and wide range of electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, although transient ST elevation is most commonly seen [2]. Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMVD) involves the coronary microcirculation, sparing the epicardial arteries. Microvascular angina (MVA) is a clinical manifestation of CMVD and can be seen in patients who present with anginal pain, without epicardial coronary disease [3]. Stable primary MVA refers to angina episodes related to effort without cardiac or systemic disease; but inclusive to this diagnosis are those with diabetes mellitus and uncomplicated hypertension. Risk factors for CMVD are similar to those for epicardial CAD and include dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking, yet the precise pathophysiology is poorly understood [3]. Coronary artery spasm is also reported in 1%–5% of percutaneous coronary interventions and can be induced via guide wire insertion. The mechanism surrounding this is believed to be a result of increased vasomotor tone and mechanical stimulation from the catheter tip [2, 4].There are many adverse reactions that can occur during coronary angiography, involving both the catheterization process and the use of radiocontrast dye [5]. Catheter-induced vasospasm is uncommon but important to recognize and distinguish from atherothrombotic disease [6]. Hypotension and bradycardia are well known complications of coronary angiography and are directly correlated with the hyperosmolality of the contrast. Ionic contrast is associated with a greater incidence of mild to moderate adverse reactions than nonionic low-osmolar agents. These reactions include bradycardia, chest pain, transient hypotension, and elevation of left ventricular end diastolic pressure [5]. We report a case in which a patient presented with potential MVA, and, during coronary engagement with iohexol (nonionic, low osmolality contrast), the patient experienced hypotension, bradycardia, and extreme chest pain.A 64-year-old woman, with a history of double vessel coronary bypass surgery (CABG) in 1998, presented with five months of increasingly frequent exertional chest tightness and dyspnea. In 1998, the patient presented similarly with a few months’ history of exertional chest heaviness, dyspnea, and jaw numbness. After a positive treadmill stress test demonstrating ST depressions, diagnostic coronary angiography was complicated by severe hypotension immediately upon catheter engagement of the left main artery, with blood pressure falling to less than 50 systolic and accompanied by severe chest pain. Limited angiographic images obtained demonstrated an 80% left main stenosis, with angiographically normal vessels in the remainder of the coronary tree. The patient was kept in hospital and sent for double vessel CABG, receiving a left internal thoracic artery (LITA) graft to LAD and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal. Since 1998, the patient had been relatively asymptomatic up until five months prior to current presentation.Her current symptoms were similar, though not identical to her initial presentation in 1998, but they were still provoked by activity and relieved with nitroglycerin spray and rest. She also reported a significant decrease in energy and her usual activities were limited due to exertional dyspnea. Review of systems was otherwise noncontributory. Notably, she was an active user of tobacco, smoking half a pack a day for the past ten years, was a social drinker, and had a mother who died from a heart attack in her early 60s. Her medical history was significant for gastroesophageal reflux, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. Her medications included atenolol, ezetimibe, rosuvastatin, paroxetine, and l-thyroxine. She had also recently been placed on topical nitrate patch. Her new-onset symptoms prompted a referral for repeat coronary and graft angiography, and possible percutaneous intervention if appropriate. Based on her cardiovascular history and current suggestive symptoms, stress testing was decided against, due to her high pretest probability of having ischemic disease.Prior to the procedure the patient had a benign physical examination with a resting ECG demonstrating sinus rhythm, with nonspecific T-wave inversions in V1 and V2. Access during the procedure was gained via right femoral artery where a 6-French sheath was inserted. Her baseline blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg. 6-French JL 4.0 and JR 4.0 catheters were used for selective coronary engagement. Immediately upon first injection of left coronary system with Omnipaque® (nonionic, low osmolality radiocontrast dye), she developed severe chest pain, hypotension (systolic blood pressure dropped to 80 mmHg), and bradycardia. Atropine 0.5 mg IV resulted in improvement of hemodynamics but had no impact on the severity of chest pain, which was reproduced with each contrast injection of the coronaries. Following atropine-related improvement in hemodynamics, intracoronary nitroglycerin was administered and she was able to tolerate completion of the procedure. Notably, chest pain severity was similar between injections of the right and left coronary systems. At case end, her hypotension and bradycardia had completely resolved; she was clinically pain-free and did not recall the pain during the procedure.In contrast to her original catheterization procedure of 1998, selective coronary angiography failed to demonstrate evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis within the left main coronary artery and remaining coronary tree (as shown in Figure 1). In addition, there was complete occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal (OM) and functional occlusion of the LITA graft to LAD, both of which appeared chronic (as shown in Figure 2). There was also normal left ventricular systolic function. Medical management was recommended, as well as risk factor modification, and she was strongly counseled on the importance of smoking cessation. The patient was discharged the same day and follow-up was arranged.This case report describes a patient presenting with typical angina without correlative angiographic findings, with unique features of procedural chest pain, bradycardia, and hypotension during selective coronary injection. These findings stand in contrast to those of her original procedure in one key respect: the absence of significant left main disease. We believe the original procedure to have been complicated by severe catheter-induced spasm of the left main artery, but this was misinterpreted as a fixed stenosis resulting in the performance of coronary artery bypass surgery. Thus, the documented occlusion coronary grafts are easily explained by the patient’s lack of obstructive, atherosclerotic CAD.A wide range of adverse effects have been described with the use of contrast media during cardiac angiography, including allergic reactions, reduced myocardial contractility, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, bronchospasm, fatal arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and embolic events [5, 7]. During our patient’s recent coronary angiography, Omnipaque, a nonionic, low-osmolar contrast, was used. When compared to high osmolar ionic media, the use of Omnipaque has been associated with significantly reduced complications [8].Cardiac catheterization has been commonly known to cause coronary ostial spasm, most typically the right coronary artery, in contrast to the left main coronary artery [9]. Catheter-induced spasm is often related to mechanical irritation and excessive catheter torque. Patient factors regarding catheter-induced spasm include excessive vasomotor tone, early endothelial dysfunction, and active smoking [9].Interestingly, the chest pain experienced by the patient during the recent angiogram was unlike her presenting cardiac angina symptoms. In review of the literature, chest pain labeled as mild/moderate has been noted in patients receiving iopamidol and ioxaglate, although the frequency of this symptom was low (16/500 cases between the two contrast dyes) [5]. The mechanism of chest pain related to the injection of contrast is not established. Another study documents angina as an adverse effect of iohexol, observed in 27 patients out of 1077, although the anginal events were not specifically described or compared to their presenting symptoms [7].Based on her typical clinical symptoms and lack of atherosclerotic disease at angiography, our patient is suspected of having microvascular angina (MVA). The diagnosis of MVA could be explored further in this patient and could involve vasodilator tests, response to vasoconstrictor stimuli, and intracoronary Doppler studies but such tests have poor sensitivity and specificity and additional patient risk, and would likely not change clinical management [3]. Myocardial ischemia related to CMVD is not a well-understood phenomenon but as the abnormalities may not be uniformly distributed amongst a major coronary branch, objective evidence is difficult to obtain [3].It was decided that our patient would be treated medically. Recommendations included discontinuing her beta-blocker, given the known propensity of such agents to worsen vasospastic phenomena, and she was aggressively counseled on the importance of smoking cessation and how this might improve her symptom control [3]. An increase in the dose of her topical nitrate and the addition of a calcium channel blocker were also discussed. While microvascular angina, catheter-induced spasm, and chest pain during coronary injection have individually been described, we believe the presence of all three features in a single patient represents a unique finding. Although routine administration of nitrates prior to angiography may not be feasible, possibly cases with left main ostial/shaft or right coronary ostial lesions could benefit from pretreatment. Systematic employment of intracoronary nitroglycerin, meticulous catheter technique, and an awareness of such issues are important for both clinicians and angiographers alike.This is a unique case of a 64-year-old who erroneously underwent coronary bypass surgery after what now seems to be severe catheter-induced left main spasm. In combination with severe chest pain and hypotension with contrast injection, these symptoms together have not been seen in the literature. It is imperative to note that since the mechanisms of microvascular angina are not fully understood, it cannot be concluded as to whether all of these symptoms are connected. It is unknown whether routine, systematic injection of intracoronary nitroglycerin prior to angiography might blunt the severity of such reactions, and it is important for angiographers and clinicians to be aware of this potential combination.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Physiologic Functional Evaluation of Left Internal Mammary Artery Graft to Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery Steal due to Unligated First Thoracic Branch in a Case of Refractory Angina
Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30308,  USAReceived 10 November 2015; Revised 29 December 2015; Accepted 17 January 2016Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2016 Fadi J. Sawaya et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Unligated side branches of the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) have been described in the literature as a cause of coronary steal resulting in angina. Despite a number of studies reporting successful side branch embolization to relieve symptoms, this phenomenon remains controversial. Hemodynamic evidence of coronary steal using angiographic and intravascular Doppler techniques has been supported by some and rejected by others. In this case study using an intracoronary Doppler wire with adenosine, we demonstrate that a trial occlusion of the LIMA thoracic side branch with selective balloon inflation can confirm physiologic significant steal and whether coil embolization of the side branch is indicated.The internal mammary artery is the graft of choice in coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery given its favorable long-term 90% patency at 10 years compared to saphenous vein grafts (SVG) [1, 2]. Left internal mammary artery (LIMA) side branches to the chest wall have been reported to occur in 10 to 20% of patients in preoperative and postoperative data [3]. Preferential blood flow through these unligated thoracic branches and subsequent coronary steal phenomena have been reported as potential causes of angina [4]. Successful ligation of these side branches surgically or through catheter embolization has been documented in the literature to effectively relieve anginal symptoms through mainly subjective measures [5, 6]. However, the hemodynamic significance of large thoracic side branches has been largely debated and is still controversial [7]. We report here a case of refractory angina in a patient with history of CABG surgery where we physiologically demonstrate coronary steal via a large unligated thoracic side branch by measuring coronary flow reserve before and after selective thoracic side branch balloon occlusion and successful treatment by coil embolization of the branch.A 50-year-old male with known history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and history of 2 vessel CABG 10 years previously presented to our facility with unstable angina. Over the preceding months, the patient experienced Canadian classification class III exertional angina despite maximal medical therapy with beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and long acting nitrates. Given his worsening angina, a diagnostic catheterization was performed showing luminal irregularities in his circumflex artery (LCX), a 100% stenosis in his mid left anterior descending artery (LAD), and a 100% stenosis in his first diagonal artery. His right coronary artery (RCA) had a 95% stenosis in the posterolateral ventricular branch (PLV). His grafts showed a patent SVG to first diagonal and a small hypoplastic patent LIMA to LAD (Figure 1). There was no further progression of native coronary artery disease compared to prior cardiac catheterization expect for a large, laterally directed LIMA first intercostal thoracic side branch suggesting possible coronary steal and preferential blood flow through the intercostal branch. The large thoracic side branch was barely apparent on an angiogram done after his bypass surgery. The PLV branch was presumed to be the culprit lesion causing the patient’s anginal symptoms and a 2.5 mm × 23 mm Promus drug eluting stent (Promus PREMIER™, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) was deployed in the PLV with excellent angiographic results.Despite coronary intervention, the patient continued to experience significant exertional angina. A cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed demonstrating a 10–15% reversible anteroapical and anterolateral ischemic defect confirming suspicion of possible coronary steal from the LIMA thoracic side branch. In light of the PET result, the patient was brought back to the catheterization laboratory with coronary flow reserve (CFR) chosen to measure the functional significance of the thoracic branch.The LIMA was engaged with a 6-French IMA guiding catheter (Cordis Corporation, Miami, FL). The coronary Doppler wire (FloWire, Volcano, San Diego, CA) was advanced into the mid-portion of LIMA distal to the first thoracic branch collateral. CFR after systemic intravenous (IV) adenosine injection (140 mcg/kg/min) was measured, and a baseline value of 3.4 was recorded (Figure 2). We then advanced, in parallel with the CFR wire, an exchange length Intuition wire (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) into the large first intercostal side branch over which a 2.0 × 20 mm Sprinter Legend balloon (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) was advanced. The balloon was inflated within the thoracic side branch inducing complete occlusion of flow (Figure 3). The CFR measurement was repeated with IV adenosine infusion (140 mcg/min/kg) during thoracic side branch occlusion revealing a value of 5.3. The discrepancy in CFR measurement from the time before and after side branch occlusion was consistent with significant coronary steal through this branch from the left internal mammary artery (Figure 4). The decision was made to proceed with embolization of the thoracic branch to restore primary graft flow to the LAD territory. The CFR wire was removed and the balloon was exchanged over the Intuition wire for a Tornado delivery catheter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) deep into the thoracic side branch. Through the delivery catheter, four 3 × 2 mm Cook Miraflex microcoils (Miraflex™, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) were successfully delivered using a long 0.018′′ Steelcore wire (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) with successful closure of the side branch. Functional closure of the thoracic branch was tested by selective injection of contrast through the microdelivery catheter. Once complete embolization was documented, the microdelivery catheter was removed and final images of the LIMA demonstrated significant increase in flow and caliber of the vessel (Figure 5). At three-month follow-up, the patient reported sustained significant improvement in angina. Given his marked improvement, repeat cardiac PET to assess him for ischemia was not justified in our opinion and would have exposed him to unnecessary radiation.LIMA is the conduit of choice for CABG surgery given its favorable long-term patency outcomes. Large unligated thoracic branches have been documented to occur in 10 to 20% of LIMA grafts. The clinical significance of these side branches has been largely debated and the decision to routinely ligate this branch at the time of CABG or later occlude the branch in the catheterization laboratory has remained controversial.Previous reports supporting the concept of IMA thoracic side branch steal and interventions to occlude the thoracic side branch have postulated improvement in myocardial ischemia through predominantly subjective measures of symptomatic angina relief or through a few reports of resolution of myocardial ischemia on stress testing [8–11].Opposing viewpoints have rejected the idea of utilizing subjective measurements as an endpoint to justify LIMA thoracic branch occlusion. In fact, Kern has suggested that LIMA side branch steal is defined as a systolic flow diversion and not a true coronary flow steal because the arterial flow to the chest wall is predominantly systolic opposed to coronary flow which is predominantly diastolic [12]. In addition, large unligated side branches have been described without any evidence of clinical symptom [13, 14] and studies that used intravascular Doppler techniques have mainly refuted this syndrome. Studies performed by Luise et al. [15], Abhyankar et al. [7], Guzon et al. [16], and Kern et al. [17] have failed to show any clinical and hemodynamic significance of IMA side branches on coronary pathophysiology under hyperemic conditions using adenosine with no change in coronary flow reserve. In addition, Gaudino et al. failed to show any significant change in LIMA coronary flow under conditions that produce both peripheral and coronary vasodilatation.On the other hand, a study by Morocutti et al. was able to reproduce our findings. Using an intracoronary Doppler wire with IV adenosine, they demonstrated that a trial of balloon occlusion of a LIMA thoracic side branch increased flow through the LIMA (CFR of 1.6 to CFR of 3.3) confirming hemodynamically significant steal. They subsequently proceeded with successful microembolization in a similar fashion to our case [18].The pathophysiology behind why IMA branch occlusion improves coronary flow in some and not in others is not fully known and needs to be further elucidated. Using intracoronary flow reserve and Doppler velocities, a trial occlusion of the LIMA side branch via balloon inflation can easily demonstrate whether flow downstream through the LIMA would increase after the intervention and would justify the risk of undergoing coil embolization or surgical ligation of the thoracic side branch. Ligation has been performed mainly by the means of coil embolization with one group deploying a vascular plug to obstruct flow into the side branch [19].We highly recommend that the hemodynamic functional significance of an unligated thoracic side branch of the LIMA be confirmed using coronary flow reserve measurement after balloon occlusion of the side branch. This provides objective stratification of unligated side branches based on validated measures of coronary flow and can potentially improve the quality of life for patients suffering angina as a result of thoracic side branch coronary steal.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
A Practical Method for No-Reflow Treatment
1Cardiology Department, Numune Education and Research Hospital, Cardiology Department, 06100 Ankara,  Turkey2Cardiology Department, Dr. Nafiz Korez State Hospital, 06100 Ankara,  TurkeyReceived 22 November 2015; Accepted 18 January 2016Academic Editor: Manabu ShirotaniCopyright © 2016 Mustafa Cetin et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.No-reflow is an undesirable result of percutaneous coronary interventions. Vasoactive drug administration at the distal part of the coronary artery is suggested as a therapeutic option for no-reflow treatment. Here, we represent two cases of successful no-reflow management with previously used monorail balloon at the same procedure as a hand-made distal infusion catheter.No-reflow is an undesirable result of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) [1]. Intracoronary (IC) vasodilators such as verapamil, nitroprusside, or adenosine are being administered for the treatment of no-reflow via the guiding catheter [2], but sometimes distal flow restoration is not satisfactory especially in patients with TIMI 0 flow. Vasoactive drug administration at the distal part of the coronary artery is suggested as a treatment option for no-reflow and some distal infusion catheters [3] and over-the-wire (OTW) balloon catheters [4] are being used for this purpose. However, OTW catheters need long guide wires and changing a short wire with a long wire has the risk of wire loss. Distal infusion catheters are special catheters for drug infusion at various vascular sites, but these catheters are not always available. Monorail balloon catheters are the most widely used catheters in routine clinical practice. Here, we describe two cases of successful no-reflow management by previously used monorail balloon at the same procedure as a hand-made distal infusion catheter.A 50-year-old male patient was taken to catheterization laboratory at the third hour of his pain with the diagnosis of acute posterolateral myocardial infarction (MI). The patient was pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid 300 mg, prasugrel 60 mg, and unfractionated heparin 100 mg/kg. Infarct related artery was first obtuse marginalis (OM) (Figure 1(a)). Total occlusion was crossed with a 0.014 inch floppy wire and the lesion was predilated with a 2.5/20 mm monorail balloon at 12 atm pressure. Control angiography revealed a thrombus shift to circumflex artery (Cx) which ceased the distal flow (Figure 1(b)). The occlusion was crossed with a second 0.014-inch floppy wire and the occlusion site was dilated with a 1.5/20 mm monorail balloon at 16 atm pressure (Figure 1(c)). After balloon angioplasty no-reflow developed. Intracoronary adenosine (250 mcg) was administered, but distal flow could not be restored (Figure 1(d)). Therefore we decided to give adenosine at the distal part of Cx and the previously used 1.5/20 mm monorail balloon was retrieved and perforated with a needle at four different sites. The perforated balloon was flushed from the hub with adenosine solution (1 cc/100 mcg) and bubbles were removed (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Then it was inserted to the distal part of the Cx and 250 mcg adenosine was injected via the balloon. Control angiography revealed TIMI 3 flow (Figure 1(e)). First OM was stented with a 3.5/12 mm bare metal stent and the procedure was terminated without any other complication.An 87-year-old female patient admitted with acute inferior MI and complete AV block at the thirteenth hour of her symptoms. The patient was taken to catheterization laboratory for primary PCI. She was pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid 300 mg, ticagrelor 180 mg, and 85 mg/kg unfractionated heparin. Right coronary artery (RCA) was totally occluded at the midportion. A 0.014-inch floppy wire was inserted to the distal part of the RCA. The lesion was predilated with 1.20/12 mm and 3.0/15 mm monorail balloons, respectively, and a 3.0/18 mm drug eluting stent was implanted at 16 atm (Figure 3(a)). No-reflow developed after stent deployment. We administered 250 mcg adenosine via the guiding catheter but could not achieve any distal flow (Figure 3(b)). Afterwards, previously used 1.20/12 mm monorail balloon was perforated and flushed with adenosine solution (1 cc/100 mcg) and bubbles were removed. Then it was inserted to the distal part of the RCA and 250 mcg adenosine was injected via the balloon (Figure 3(c)). TIMI 3 flow was restored (Figure 3(d)).No-reflow increases mortality and hospital stay in acute MI patients [5]. Distal microembolisation, endothelial dysfunction, and reperfusion injury (by increasing the microvascular resistance) are the proposed mechanisms of no-reflow [6]. Antiplatelet agents, thrombus aspiration, distal embolic protection devices, and vasodilator drugs can be used for prevention and treatment of no-reflow [7]. IC vasodilator administration through the guiding catheter is frequently performed to resolve no-reflow. But it is obvious that administered vasodilator agents cannot penetrate to the coronary microcirculation especially in patients with TIMI 0 flow because there is no blood flow at the distal part of the vessel during no-reflow period. In addition, when vasodilator drug is administered by the guiding catheter, it penetrates to other coronary territories and the vasodilator drug concentration dilutes.Administration of the vasodilator drugs at the distal part of the coronary can deal with these problems and vasoactive drug utility can be increased at the distal part of the coronary artery. OTW balloon catheters [8] and distal infusion catheters [9, 10] have been using for this purpose and positive results were reported with distal vasodilator drug injection. However these two types of catheters have some disadvantages. Distal infusion catheters (like ClearWay, Atrium Medical Corporation, Hudson, NH, USA/multifunction probing catheter, Boston Scientific Corporation, Boston, MA) are suitable for drug administration at the distal part of coronary artery, but these catheters are not routinely found in most of the laboratories. OTW balloons are not the first choices in daily practice and need a long guidewire. Wire exchange for OTW balloon usage has the risk of wire loss and failure of rewiring, a very annoying situation for the operator. Monorail balloons are frequently used in daily practice. They are easily retrievable and they can be used with short guidewires. Here, we described successful usage of a monorail balloon for distal vasodilator drug infusion. There may be some safety concerns about inserting a perforated balloon to the distal part of the coronary and drug infusion through this balloon, but we did not encounter any complication with this method and reached successful results. Flushing the perforated balloon from the hub takes away the risk of air bubble embolism. Perforating the balloon form multiple sites reduces the risk of coronary dissection due to saline flow because injected saline’s pressure is reduced by multiple holes. In addition, this method does not impose an additional cost to the procedure. Health expenditure is very important all around the world. We think that distal drug infusion with this method is safe and effective at least like other catheters; therefore using a new catheter and rising the cost of the procedure are unnecessary. In conclusion, perforation of a monorail balloon with a needle and using as a distal infusion catheter can be used for no-reflow treatment. We achieved favorable results with this off-label usage. This method is always available, easy, and safe and has no additional cost.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
A Retained Bullet in Pericardial Sac: Penetrating Gunshot Injury of the Heart

Cardiac gunshot injuries are exceptional and it occurs mostly during interpersonal disagreements casualties or a mistakenly fired gun nowadays. Here we present a case of cardiac gunshot injury from the war of Kobani, Syria. The patient was mistakenly diagnosed to have a sole bullet in the left shoulder while he had a penetrating cardiac trauma with a bullet in the heart and pericardial effusion possibly giving rise to pericardial tamponade. Luckily the cardiac gunshot injury was noticed one day later and the patient was referred to a tertiary hospital. Intrapericardial bullet was conservatively followed up. The patient was discharged one week later after resection of the bullet in the shoulder.Penetrating cardiac trauma is rarely seen but when present there is a short time lag to keep the patients alive. Cardiac gunshot injuries are exceptional and they occur mostly during interpersonal disagreements casualties or a mistakenly fired gun nowadays. Most cases of the literature of cardiac gunshot injuries come from the data of World War II [1] and Lebanese civil war [2]. Nearly 81% of patients with cardiac gunshot injury lost their life [3]. When a cardiac gunshot injury is suspected computerized tomography, transthoracic echocardiography, and transesophageal echocardiography are suggested for evaluation of cardiac compromise, bullet trajectory, and the localization of the bullet [4]. Surgical intervention is gold standard when hemodynamic compromise like pericardial tamponade, hypovolemic shock due to bleeding is present. However, there is no treatment consensus of hemodynamic stable patient with cardiac gunshot injury and it varies from patient to patient.Here we present a case of cardiac gunshot injury from the war of Kobani, Syria. The patient was mistakenly diagnosed to have a sole bullet in the left shoulder while he had a PCT with a bullet in the pericardial sac and pericardial effusion possibly giving rise to pericardial tamponade. One day later the bullet in the heart was noticed and luckily the pericardial effusion was shifted to the right pleura. With this case report we would like to point out cautious interrogation of gunshot wounds despite clinical stability at admission and follow-up.A 32-year-old male fighter was brought to our emergency department on the morning of 6th January, 2015, with several other wounded fighters from the war of Kobani, Syria. Because of the ongoing war, there have been many gunshot wounds, bomb blast wounds, and deaths admitted to our ED. Whenever a casualty arrived to the ED all the staff intensify for minimizing the time loss to save the patients. Fast triage for all the patients is required to determine which patients need to refer to tertiary hospitals and which patients to intervene on the scene. This patient arrived to our hospital after a suicide bomb attack with nine other patients. Physical examination revealed a superficial wound on the left shoulder and another on the left side of thorax at the 6th intercostals space. There were no exit sides of these wounds which were thought to be bullet wounds. He was conscious with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15, a blood pressure of 110/55 mmHg, a body temperature of 36.3°C, respiratory rate of 22/minute, an oxygen saturation of 93% on room air, and a heart rate of 103 beats per minute. After first evaluation of the patient a thoracoabdominal computerized tomography (CT) was ordered. A bullet was seen in the left shoulder at proximal humerus (Figure 1). There was no fracture of the bone. Intravenous saline, antibiotic, and intramuscular tetanus vaccine were started and the patient was admitted to the general surgery ward for extraction of the bullet. There was moderate dyspnea of the patient which was attributed to anxiety and pain shock. The patient was mobilized during the evening. He had severe dyspnea which was resolved suddenly at 01.00 am and he slept till 06.30 without any symptoms.The radiologist and the general surgeon of the hospital noticed a pericardial bullet in the patients CT while checking it. The CT shows a hyperdense material in the heart with up to 2 cm pericardial effusion. Transverse cut view of chest CT shows a bullet in the pericardial sac with pericardial effusion compressing the heart (Figure 2). Sagittal cut view of chest CT also revealed a bullet in the pericardial sac with pericardial effusion (Figure 3). There was no evident projectile trajectory.Cardiology consultation was made. A bedside physical evaluation showed normal heart sounds without any murmurs. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with a rate of 67 bpm and no abnormality. A bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a hyperechogenicity embedded near to the connection of interatrial and interventricular septum in apical 4-chamber view (Figure 4); however, a definite conclusion could not be made if the bullet is compromising the myocardium. There were no valvular insufficiency and no interventricular or interatrial connections. The pericardial effusion seen in CT was drained to the right pleura. The patient was stable. No pericardial effusion, no valvular insufficiency, and no rhythm abnormalities were observed.The patient was referred to a tertiary cardiovascular institution for follow-up and definite treatment. After a detailed evaluation conservative follow-up was decided and the patient was observed one week in the coronary care unit. He was discharged on the 13th of January after resection of the bullet in the left shoulder. He showed up to his first month visit without any complaints. We do not have any news from him since then.The most important clinical presentation of cardiac gunshot injuries is those leading to the cardiac wound, pericardial tamponade, and intrathoracic bleeding. Valvular insufficiencies intracardiac shunts, and conduction defects could be seen in the early course of the trauma. Bacterial endocarditis [5], pericarditis [6], systemic or pulmonary embolization of the missile or thrombi, and neurotic manifestations of various degrees could be late presentations.The management of cardiac gunshot injuries depends on hemodynamic compromise of the patient. Surgical intervention and correction are an obligation when hemorrhagic shock due to blood loss and pericardial tamponade is present. Some patients may have no time to reach healthcare institution due to severe blood loss and tamponade. When a patient suffers from a cardiac gunshot injury with stable hemodynamic, a careful evaluation is warranted. A thorough physical examination with evaluation vital signs must be the first step. Then chest X-ray and chest CT must be ordered for the possible damage of the vital organs and for localization foreign material. TTE is performed to confirm pericardial effusion and localization of foreign material. Despite progress in surgical interventions and postoperative care the management of retained missiles in the heart and pericardium is still controversial [7–10].Surgical care of gunshot wounds of the heart and the descending aorta and thoracic or abdominal aorta focuses on substantial and continuous blood loss [11]. Resuscitation management of these penetrating injuries involves massive volume replacement of colloid and crystalloid solutions as well as of blood [12]. Other organ injuries (liver, lungs, stomach, and small intestines) may worsen the situation and complicate the resuscitation. Early surgical intervention may be the only diagnostic and therapeutic procedure at hand, as rapid operative control of the hemorrhagic site is the most effective resuscitation manoeuvre [13]. Correction of damaged tissue must be performed as fast as possible. Projectile trajectory must be followed up for injured tissues. A successful surgical gunshot injury of 16-year-old boy was presented by Aydemir et al. [14]. In this case the projectile entered from right anterior thoracic cavity, passed through the right lung, right atrium, atrial septum, left ventricle, and left lung, and ended up between the eighth and ninth ribs. Early surgical intervention saved this patient’s life.In our case the first examination of the patient revealed a stable hemodynamic and two inlet wounds without exit. A CT of chest was mistakenly reported as the patient has only one bullet in the left shoulder while he had one in the myocardium with pericardial effusion. Because of our increased workload with nine other casualties no one noticed the CT finding and the patient was interned to the ward for removal of the bullet in the shoulder. The patient’s dyspnea is resolved by itself suddenly and he had a comfortable sleep. TTE was performed for the pericardial effusion and intracardiac bullet. TTE showed an embedded bullet to the connection of interatrial and interventricular septum. There was no valvular compromise and electrical instability. Pericardial effusion was drained to the right pleura and the patient was stable. Resection of the bullet of the shoulder was performed and the patient was discharged without any intervention after one-week follow-up in the ward of the tertiary hospital.Cardiac gunshot injuries are very rare in daily routine of medical practice. Physical examination, chest X-ray, chest CT, and TTE are the key elements for rapid diagnosis and management. Here we present a case of cardiac gunshot injury and missed diagnosis because of increased workload. By this case we would like to draw attention to a careful evaluation of gunshot wounds whatever the clinical situation of the patient is.The authors certify that there is no conflict of interests with any financial organization regarding the material discussed in the paper.All authors have read and approved the paper.
Stenting of Variant Left Carotid Artery Using Brachial Artery Approach in a Patient with Unusual Type of Bovine Aortic Arch

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Bovine aortic arch is the most frequently encountered variation in human aortic arch branching. A 63-year-old Asian male presented with symptomatic severe stenosis of left carotid artery originating from the brachiocephalic trunk. Selective engagement to the left carotid artery was unsuccessful using transfemoral approach. We reported on a successful left carotid artery stenting case using right brachial artery approach in a bovine aortic arch. This paper is worthy of reporting in terms of guiding physicians for interventional procedures in these types of challenging cases.“Bovine aortic arch” refers to the most common variant of aortic arch branching in humans. This configuration can be found in approximately 27% of the population and can be further divided into 2 subtypes. In the less usual subtype (7%), the left common carotid artery (CCA) originates directly from the innominate artery, while the more usual subtype can be described as the common origin of the innominate artery and the left CCA and can be found in approximately 20% of the population [1]. However, the actual bovine arch pattern, found in cattle, is different and has no resemblance to any of the above described human aortic arch patterns. A single great vessel originates from the aortic arch which gives two subclavians for either side and a bicarotid trunk. The bicarotid trunk then divides into the left and right CCA [2].In these anatomic variants, selective cannulation of the left CCA is often technically difficult from the transfemoral approach. We report on a successful left carotid stenting case using right brachial artery approach in a patient with “bovine aortic arch.”A 63-year-old Asian male with hypertension was admitted due to recent attacks of transient right upper extremity weakness and numbness, lasting 3 to 5 min. On admission, his blood pressure was high at 170/90 mmHg and heart rate was 80 beats/min. Neurologic examination was normal. Doppler ultrasound examination showed normal right internal carotid artery velocities (0.92 m/s of peak systolic velocity) and elevated velocities in the left internal carotid artery (2.79 m/s of peak systolic velocity) suggesting critical stenosis. Six months before this admission, he had undergone arch aortography at an outside institution using a femoral artery approach, which confirmed critical stenosis in the proximal right internal carotid artery (ICA), variant origin of the left CCA from the proximal brachiocephalic trunk, and also critical stenosis in the proximal left ICA (Figure 1). After selective cannulation of right CCA, successful carotid stent placement had been performed with distal protection at the bifurcation level (Figure 2). Left carotid stenosis had not been stented at that time. Because of the right sided transient ischemic attack episodes on admission to our institution, we decided to perform stenting to the stenosis in left ICA. Firstly, femoral approach was tried. However, selective engagement to the left CCA could not be possible in this way using standard catheters and Simmons catheter; therefore, right brachial approach was considered.After pretreatment with aspirin (325 mg daily) and clopidogrel (75 mg daily) for five days, a 7 Fr sheath was inserted in the right brachial artery. A 5 Fr hydrophilic coated vertebral catheter (Merit Medical Systems, Inc., Utah, USA) was then advanced into the brachiocephalic trunk to engage selectively the left CCA (Figure 3). 0.035′′ flexible guidewire (Merit Medical Systems, USA) was positioned at the left external carotid artery using this vertebral catheter and exchanged with a 0.035′′ Amplatz extra-support guidewire. After that, a 7 Fr Asahi Zenyteex guiding catheter (Asahi-Intecc, USA) was positioned at the left common carotid artery and extra-support guidewire was removed. Selective left carotid angiography confirmed critical stenosis at the bifurcation level of ICA (Figure 4). Distal embolic protection system (Emboshield, Abbot, IL, USA) was deployed in the distal ICA under fluoroscopic guidance. A 6 × 9 × 40 mm Sinus Carotid (Optimed, Ettlingen, Germany) self-expandable stent was successfully deployed in the left common and internal carotid artery, and postdilation was performed using a 5 × 20 mm Pyxis-c balloon (Stron Medical, Winsen, Germany) with the inflation at 10 atm for 10 sec (Figure 5). After postdilation, the follow-up angiogram showed complete coverage of the lesion without residual stenosis or dissection (Figure 6). The embolic protection system was removed and moderate debris was identified. The brachial artery sheath was removed and excellent hemostasis was achieved. The patient tolerated the procedure well and did not suffer any complications. He was discharged within 24 hours without any neurologic deficit and is now followed up at the outpatient clinic in a stable condition.Percutaneous carotid artery stenting represents a minimally invasive and less traumatic alternative to conventional surgical repair for managing carotid artery stenosis in selected patients, particularly those with younger (less than 70 years) and/or higher surgical risk [3, 4]. However, it is reported that transfemoral intervention is difficult in 1-2% of cases due to occlusive disease of the aorta and the iliofemoral arteries [5]. Alternative vascular access routes, such as the brachial artery, radial artery, or the direct route using the carotid artery, have been used in these cases [6–8]. Recent experiences with transbrachial carotid procedures have demonstrated that the brachial artery is a safe, feasible, and useful access route when the transfemoral procedure is difficult [9]. In our patient, the origin of the left CCA from the brachiocephalic trunk made the femoral approach less desirable. This bovine variant can be seen in 7% of the general population and is distinct from the more common bovine arch configuration that occurs in 27% involving a common origin of the brachiocephalic trunk and the left common carotid artery from the aortic arch. Although we used Simmons catheter containing complex curves in addition to standard catheters, selective cannulation of the left CCA could not be possible. For this reason, brachial access was considered. While performing the brachial approach, the guiding catheter position was stable and allowed the successful introduction of the balloon catheter and stent. This case showed that the right brachial access might be useful alternative for stenting of variant left carotid artery in patients with unusual type of bovine aortic arch. Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting procedures are technically difficult from the transfemoral approach in variant aortic arch branching such as “bovine aortic arch.” We performed a right brachial artery approach for selective cannulation of a variant left CCA originating from the brachiocephalic trunk and performed successful carotid stenting with distal protection.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Bortezomib-Induced Complete Heart Block and Myocardial Scar: The Potential Role of Cardiac Biomarkers in Monitoring Cardiotoxicity

Traditionally, bortezomib was thought to have little cardiovascular toxicity; however, there is increasing evidence that bortezomib can lead to cardiac complications including left ventricular dysfunction and atrioventricular block. We present the case of a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma and persistent asymptomatic elevations of cardiac biomarkers who developed complete heart block and evidence of myocardial scar after his eighth cycle of bortezomib, requiring permanent pacemaker placement. In addition to discussing the cardiovascular complications of bortezomib therapy, we propose a potential role for biomarkers in the prediction and monitoring of bortezomib cardiotoxicity. With newer chemotherapeutic agents, survival rates for many cancers have increased dramatically. Unfortunately, many of these agents have unintended cardiovascular side effects. There has been increasing focus on developing strategies with cardiac biomarkers to better predict and monitor chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity [1]. Although the majority of the work has focused on anthracyclines and HER2 targeted therapies, other chemotherapeutics can lead to cardiac dysfunction. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Though rare, cardiac complications including heart block and heart failure have been described [2]. We report the case of a patient with persistently elevated cardiac biomarkers who developed complete heart block and myocardial scar after his eighth cycle of bortezomib therapy. This case illustrates potential bortezomib-induced cardiac complications and the possible role of cardiac biomarkers in identifying individuals at higher risk for developing bortezomib cardiotoxicity.A 66-year-old man with stage IIIA IgA lambda chain multiple myeloma receiving chemotherapy with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRD) with no significant cardiovascular history presented for a routine pre-stem cell transplant clinic appointment. He was feeling well and had not experienced any recent chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope. He reported mild fatigue but continued to engage in daily 30-minute walks without limitation. In the oncology clinic, he underwent routine electrocardiogram as part of the stem cell transplant workup which revealed complete atrioventricular (AV) block with a ventricular escape rhythm of 55 beats per minute (bpm) (Figure 1). On exam, his blood pressure was 124/59 mmHg and pulse was 52 bpm. Physical exam revealed a regular rhythm with normal heart sounds and no other abnormalities. Laboratory testing showed normal electrolytes, normal kidney and liver function, and mild normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL). Cardiac biomarkers were elevated with troponin I of 2.49 ng/mL, CK-MB of 20.2, and creatine phosphokinase of 549. BNP was also elevated at 333 pg/mL. Echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55% and mild hypokinesis of the midinferolateral myocardium. Throughout this time, the patient remained asymptomatic. The patient was transferred urgently to a tertiary care facility for further management.The patient was first diagnosed with multiple myeloma nine months earlier after seeking medical attention for right arm weakness and paresthesia. A bone scan was consistent with extensive metastatic disease and he underwent biopsy of a right humerus lytic lesion which demonstrated a lambda restricted plasma cell population consistent with a plasmacytoma. On serologic testing, he was noted to have an IgA lambda monoclonal gammopathy and a 24-hour urine protein was notable for 19.8 g of protein of which 19.6 g represented urine free lambda excretion. Despite his significant urinary protein excretion, his kidney function (BUN, creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate) remained normal. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed multiple myeloma without evidence of amyloid deposition. He was initiated on bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCD). He received three cycles without significant response, so his treatment regimen was changed to VRD. Complete treatment regimen with associated clinical and laboratory parameters is presented in Table 1.During his initial chemotherapy regimen with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone, he was noted to have elevated troponin I at 0.163 ng/mL and BNP at 1810 pg/mL. Given these findings, he was referred to cardiology clinic for evaluation of possible cardiac amyloidosis (despite negative bone marrow evaluation). Aside from hyperlipidemia, he had no personal or family history of cardiovascular disease including significant conduction system disease. In the month prior to his multiple myeloma diagnosis, he completed an exercise stress echocardiogram which was negative for ischemia. The echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular (LV) function and wall thickness and the stress ECG showed sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block. Due to the elevated cardiac biomarkers, he underwent a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram which again demonstrated normal LV function without significant diastolic dysfunction. A repeat ECG obtained at the time showed normal sinus rhythm with normal voltage and incomplete right bundle branch block. As a result of these findings, cardiac amyloidosis was considered unlikely.Upon transfer to the tertiary care hospital, the patient remained in complete AV block. A cardiac MRI was obtained, revealing normal left ventricular function (ejection fraction of 60%), with myocardial thinning and a small subendocardial perfusion defect in the midinferolateral segment with focal late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) suggestive of scar/fibrosis (Figure 2). There was no evidence on the MRI to suggest cardiac amyloidosis or other infiltrative diseases such as LV hypertrophy and/or diffuse LGE. Left heart catheterization was subsequently performed showing angiographically normal coronary arteries (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Throughout all of these procedures, the patient remained hemodynamically stable in complete heart block. He ultimately underwent implantation of a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker. Unfortunately, he was unable to move forward with stem cell transplant after the pacemaker implantation due to significant pulmonary fibrosis identified during vital organ testing. He elected not to receive any additional chemotherapy and eventually expired from progression of his multiple myeloma.This case demonstrates rare adverse cardiovascular effects of bortezomib and introduces the potential usefulness of biomarkers to predict cardiac dysfunction in patients undergoing active treatment with this chemotherapy. Utilizing cardiac biomarkers such as troponin I and BNP as a method to predict cardiac dysfunction during treatment with bortezomib has not been previously described.Our patient presented with atrioventricular (AV) heart block in the setting of ongoing chemotherapy with bortezomib (8 cycles). Advanced age and cumulative dose have been shown to increase the risk of adverse cardiac events [3]. In our case, the patient was noted to have asymptomatic elevations of troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as early as six months prior to the development of AV block on ECG. These levels were persistently elevated, with troponin I reaching levels suggestive of myocardial necrosis. Further evaluation with cardiac MRI demonstrated scar/fibrosis in the inferolateral left ventricle, and there was no significant coronary artery disease seen on left heart catheterization. Based on a Naranjo score of 5-6, it is “possible or probable” the scar seen on MRI and the AV block was an adverse event due to bortezomib exposure [4].Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity is the likely cause for the observed findings. The patient underwent thorough cardiac evaluation to rule out common cardiac conditions that can cause the observed findings such as atherosclerotic heart disease and myocarditis. In addition, based on the echocardiogram and cardiac MRI findings, there is no evidence to suggest cardiac amyloid or other infiltrative diseases as the cause of his cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac MRI has emerged as a noninvasive method to aid in diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis in preselected patients with studies showing sensitivity and specificity in the range of 86–88% and 86–90% in those with positive endomyocardial biopsy [5, 6]. In patients without biopsy proven amyloidosis (endomyocardial or other tissue types), those with cardiac amyloidosis demonstrate characteristic diffuse LGE patterns coupled with other markers of cardiac dysfunction such as LV hypertrophy [7]. Our patient had a negative bone marrow biopsy for amyloidosis and cardiac MRI lacked typical features of amyloidosis, suggesting extremely low likelihood of cardiac amyloidosis.Although the patient was exposed to multiple chemotherapeutics, we believe that bortezomib is the likely cause of his cardiac dysfunction. Cyclophosphamide can lead to left ventricular dysfunction, myopericarditis, and heart block; however, these findings generally occur during therapy or the first several weeks posttreatment [8, 9]. When our patient’s cardiac dysfunction developed, it had been over five months since he had received any cyclophosphamide. Thus, cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity is quite unlikely. Lenalidomide is associated with thromboembolism but rarely with any other cardiovascular toxicity (as compared to thalidomide which can cause bradyarrhythmias) [8, 9].Bortezomib is a dipeptide boronate proteasome inhibitor. It reversibly binds and inhibits the 20S proteasome which is the proteolytic core particle of the 26S proteasome [10]. In the United States, it is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. The presence of cardiac dysfunction with its use ranges from 0 to 17.9% in reported studies, though a meta-analysis of these data failed to identify definite increased cardiac risk [3]. The reported adverse cardiac events included cardiomyopathy/congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, AV block, and supraventricular tachycardia [2, 11–13]. Some data suggests that these cardiotoxicities may occur even in the absence of underlying cardiovascular disease or risk factors. For example, one observational study reported 11.6% incidence of cardiac complications in patients without prior cardiac history treated with bortezomib [2]. The lack of prospective studies has made it difficult to accurately quantitate the true risk of cardiac dysfunction associated with bortezomib however.The exact mechanism by which bortezomib interacts with cardiac myocardium is unknown, but there are several postulated mechanisms for the development of cardiac dysfunction, including direct cardiac insult as well as indirect exacerbation of underlying cardiac disease. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an important role in regulating the cell cycle in cardiac myocytes. As a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib impairs the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-beta which is essential for cell survival, regulative apoptosis gene expression, and angiogenesis [14]. Proteasome inhibition also has downstream effects on vascular smooth muscle cells leading to atherosclerotic plaque instability [15]. In patients with cardiac risk factors or prior history of coronary artery disease, bortezomib may cause plaque progression and increase the vulnerability of existing plaque leading to ischemic events. In animal studies, there has been evidence of decreased proteasome activity impairing cardiac function by accumulation of proteins inside the myocytes as well as mitochondrial abnormalities resulting in impaired contractility [16, 17]. Through one or more of these mechanisms, the end result for patients undergoing treatment with bortezomib is increased risk of cardiac dysfunction.Although limited data currently exist, similar cardiovascular toxicities have been associated with the use of the novel irreversible proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib. The majority of the observed cardiotoxicities with this agent were new-onset left ventricular dysfunction. These findings are most common in patients who had a history of cardiac events and exposure to doxorubicin. In this population, elevated BNP levels were also commonly observed, although the clinical significance of this finding remains unclear. In addition, hypotension and arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation have been reported [18, 19]. Given these data, in patients that develop significant cardiac dysfunction due to bortezomib or another proteasome inhibitor, considerable caution should be exercised if rechallenge with the drug is deemed necessary. If the primary cardiac toxicity has not been definitely treated (e.g., with a pacemaker) and/or completely resolved, alternative agents should be considered.There is increasing evidence that cardiac biomarkers can both predict and detect chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Most of the research has focused on troponin and BNP. Cardiac troponins (I and T) are sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury, and BNP is a neurohormone released from the ventricular tissue in the setting of elevated filling pressure and myocardial stress. A number of studies have evaluated the role of troponin in the detection of subclinical myocardial disease and the risk of developing overt cardiac dysfunction with the use of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly anthracyclines and trastuzumab. In a study of 211 breast cancer patients receiving anthracyclines, patients with baseline elevated troponin levels were more likely to develop cardiac dysfunction during therapy [20]. In a related study, elevations in troponin as early as 12 hours after exposure to anthracyclines predict patients at higher risk for future cardiovascular events [21]. Similarly, there was an increased risk of cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients exposed to anthracyclines and trastuzumab who demonstrated increased troponin levels [22]. Although the majority of studies suggest that BNP is useful in predicting anthracycline induced cardiac dysfunction, the data is conflicting in the trastuzumab population [22–25]. BNP may also be useful in predicting and monitoring cardiac dysfunction due to tyrosine kinase inhibitors used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma [26].Biomarker elevations are also predictive of mortality and adverse outcomes in other cancer populations such as those with cardiac amyloidosis or stem cell transplant recipients. Both NT pro-BNP and troponin T can be used as markers of disease prognosis in patients with cardiac amyloidosis [27, 28]. In these patients being considered for stem cell transplant, elevated levels of troponin and BNP predict early morbidity and mortality providing guidance about a patient’s suitability for this procedure [29, 30].Despite this increasingly robust biomarker data, there are no studies specifically addressing the role of biomarkers in predicting bortezomib cardiotoxicity. BNP elevations were commonly observed in patients exposed to the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (median increase of 407 pg/mL from baseline); however, the predictive and/or diagnostic benefit is not clear [18]. Although the incidence of cardiotoxicity is lower with bortezomib compared to other chemotherapeutics, it still may be reasonable to apply the surveillance algorithms prior to and during therapy with proteasome inhibitors in an effort to detect those at higher risk for developing cardiac dysfunction. Using biomarkers to detect subclinical toxicity may allow for earlier cardiovascular treatment and/or intervention to prevent more significant cardiac dysfunction. Nonetheless, additional studies are necessary to specifically evaluate the potential predictive and/or diagnostic role of cardiac biomarkers in bortezomib treated patients and to identify the optimal timing and frequency of monitoring.Heart block and myocardial scar/fibrosis are rare but serious side effects associated with bortezomib administration. Although the incidence of cardiotoxicity is low in patients treated with bortezomib, these events can affect patient morbidity and mortality independent of the oncologic prognosis. Improved surveillance and early detection of cardiac disorders during therapy has the potential to improve patient outcomes and prevent the discontinuation of cancer therapy.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
Reversibility of High-Grade Atrioventricular Block with Revascularization in Coronary Artery Disease without Infarction: A Literature Review
Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136,  USAReceived 2 November 2015; Accepted 10 January 2016Academic Editor: Konstantinos P. LetsasCopyright © 2016 Rhanderson Cardoso et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Complete atrioventricular (AV) block is known to be reversible in some cases of acute inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI). The reversibility of high-grade AV block in non-MI coronary artery disease (CAD), however, is rarely described in the literature. Herein we perform a literature review to assess what is known about the reversibility of high-grade AV block after right coronary artery revascularization in CAD patients who present without an acute MI. To illustrate this phenomenon we describe a case of 2 : 1 AV block associated with unstable angina, in which revascularization resulted in immediate and durable restoration of 1 : 1 AV conduction, thereby obviating the need for permanent pacemaker implantation. The literature review suggests two possible explanations: a vagally mediated response or a mechanism dependent on conduction system ischemia. Due to the limited understanding of AV block reversibility following revascularization in non-acute MI presentations, it remains difficult to reliably predict which patients presenting with high-grade AV block in the absence of MI may have the potential to avoid permanent pacemaker implantation via coronary revascularization. We thus offer this review as a potential starting point for the approach to such patients. Permanent pacing is the routine treatment for irreversible third-degree and advanced second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block [1, 2]. Although necessary and effective in most patients with such conditions, the implantation of a permanent pacemaker is costly [3, 4] and is associated with significant potential acute complications, including but not limited to infection [5], bleeding [6], hematoma [2], hemothorax [7], lead dislodgement [8], and atrial [9, 10] or ventricular [9, 11] rupture. Moreover, pacemaker leads over time are subject to fracture, insulation break, or recall, which may require lead extraction, a potentially high-risk procedure [12, 13]. It is therefore desirable from both societal [14] and individual [15] patient points of view to thoroughly rule out all reversible causes of bradyarrhythmia before commitment to a permanent device [2]. Reversible causes of high-grade AV block include hypothyroidism [16], hyperthyroidism [17], lymphoma [18], herbal medications [19], chemotherapeutic agents [20], Lyme disease [21], viral myocarditis [22], apical ballooning syndrome [23], and negative chronotropic agents [24].Acute myocardial infarction (MI), particularly with injury to the inferior wall, is also a well-described cause of reversible AV block [25–27]. Potential reversibility of high-grade AV block in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients without an acute MI, in contrast, is a relatively unexplored concept. Herein, we present a literature review prompted by a case of unexpected postrevascularization reversal of symptomatic AV block.An 85-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and baseline ejection fraction of 40% following an inferior wall MI in 1996 presented with approximately one week of lightheadedness and chest pain at rest. Previously, his symptoms of chronic stable angina were well controlled with isosorbide mononitrate. An electrocardiogram was performed, revealing 2 : 1 AV block with a ventricular rate of 37 beats per minute (Figure 1). The patient had no prior history of conduction system abnormality. Common causes of reversible AV block were excluded, and the patient was admitted in anticipation of permanent pacemaker implantation. Cardiac biomarkers were negative. Cardiac monitoring continued to show 2 : 1 and occasionally higher-grade AV block.Given the history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and symptoms consistent with unstable angina, a decision was made to proceed with left heart catheterization before pacemaker implantation. Coronary angiography revealed a dominant right coronary artery (RCA) with 80% ostial stenosis (Figure 2(a)). A drug-eluting stent was successfully deployed to the ostial RCA lesion with an outstanding angiographic result (Figure 2(b)). Upon revascularization, the patient immediately reverted to 1 : 1 AV conduction (Figure 3) and has remained in normal sinus rhythm with mild first-degree AV block since then. The lightheadedness and fatigue have entirely resolved. Permanent pacemaker implantation was avoided.The noteworthy finding in this case is the complete resolution of symptomatic high-grade AV block upon revascularization of the RCA. Review of the literature reveals two possible mechanisms for the presence of clinically significant AV block in patients without MI who experience restoration of normal AV conduction following coronary revascularization. These mechanisms are vagally mediated heart block and ischemia-driven conduction delay.Vagally mediated bradyarrhythmia is well documented in patients with myocardial ischemia or injury. Ischemic-mediated mechanical stretch and chemical substances stimulate receptors located in the inferior and posterior left ventricular walls [28]. These receptors lead to activation of nonmyelinated afferent C-fibers from the vagus nerve, which in turn result in increased vagal tone and bradyarrhythmia [28, 29]. This mechanism is known as the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. One case report discusses a patient with non-ST elevation MI who developed complete heart block in the setting of a 90% stenosis of the RCA acute marginal branch. The AV block resolved after balloon angioplasty of this lesion. Because the acute marginal branch does not supply the AV node, the mechanism for third-degree AV block was attributed to the Bezold-Jarisch reflex triggered by inferior wall ischemia [29].Patients with CAD are especially susceptible to vagal stimulation, as demonstrated by the frequency of carotid sinus hypersensitivity in this population, as well as by the correlation of carotid hypersensitivity with the severity of CAD [30–32]. Jick and Linenthal, for example, reported a case of 2 : 1 AV block in an 85-year-old man with two previous myocardial infarctions and ischemic cardiomyopathy. In a time before percutaneous coronary intervention was available, they observed complete reversal of the 2 : 1 AV block to 1 : 1 AV conduction with atropine administration, as well as progression to complete heart block with carotid sinus massage, phenomena consistent with a vagal etiology of the conduction system disease [33]. Furthermore, coronary revascularization has been shown to attenuate postexercise heart rate decay in patients with RCA lesions, which suggests decreased vagal activity following reperfusion in inferior wall ischemia [34].Although these descriptions confirm biologic plausibility, whether the decreased cardiac sensitivity to vagal stimuli after revascularization can fully reverse 2 : 1 AV block and avoid further episodes of high-grade AV block is difficult to prove and appears to be a rare phenomenon. Moreover, if the heart block was solely mediated by increased vagal tone, one would expect to see episodes of intermittent AV block during times of high vagal tone, despite revascularization.AV conduction defects that resolve with revascularization may occur as a direct result of ischemia, a circumstance more consistent with complete postrevascularization restoration of 1 : 1 AV conduction, such as that observed in the case above. The AV node blood supply is provided by the AV nodal branch, which most commonly arises from the RCA [35], although it can rarely be a branch of the circumflex artery in patients with left coronary artery dominance [36–38]. Meanwhile, infranodal conduction system structures are supplied almost entirely by the septal perforator branches of the LAD artery, with variable dual supply provided by either the RCA or left circumflex artery [38–41]. Decreased flow to the septal branches or RCA is therefore associated with a variety of conduction disturbances [42, 43]. Importantly, the presence of high-grade AV block is associated with a 4-fold and 3-fold increased risk of in-hospital mortality for anterior and inferior wall acute infarctions, respectively [44]. Further, the presence of third-degree AV block in inferior MI has also been associated with an increased incidence of sustained hypotension and ventricular tachyarrhythmia [45].In acute inferior wall MI, where the RCA is often the culprit, high-grade AV block has been described in up to 17% of cases [26]. Most of these cases are transient and resolve either spontaneously or with revascularization, whereas approximately 9% will ultimately require a permanent pacemaker, implicating permanent damage to AV conduction tissue prior to or due to lack of revascularization [46, 47]. The 2008 ACC/AHA/HRS Guidelines for Device-Based Therapy acknowledge that, in cases of third-degree AV block complicating inferior wall MI, permanent pacing should be reserved for patients in whom the block does not resolve with revascularization [1]. The possibility of transient AV block secondary to myocardial ischemia in patients without MI is not discussed in current practice guidelines [1].In patients with CAD presenting without acute MI, the reversibility of high-grade AV block and the avoidance of pacemaker implantation via revascularization are infrequently described in the literature. In a single-center retrospective study evaluating the reversibility of AV block in patients with CAD, Hwang et al. assessed 188 patients with high-grade AV block for the presence of concomitant CAD. Fifty-eight (30.8%) individuals were found to have CAD, distributed as follows: stable angina, 41; acute MI, 15; and unstable angina, 2. As expected, AV block was reversible with revascularization in 13 of the 15 patients presenting with acute MI. The culprit lesion was located in the RCA in 14 of the 15 acute MI patients. Conversely, only 1 of the 43 patients (2.3%) with stable angina and none of the 2 patients with unstable angina reverted to 1 : 1 AV conduction after revascularization, despite the fact that roughly 60% (26/43) of these patients also had significant RCA lesions [48].Yesil et al. studied 53 pacemaker patients with complete heart block and significant CAD, defined by the presence of a coronary lesion with greater than 70% stenosis. In this study, patients with acute coronary syndrome were excluded. After a mean follow-up of  months, third-degree AV block persisted in 13/16 (81%) patients treated medically and in 27/37 (73%) of the revascularized patients. Despite most of the lesions being in the RCA, the difference was not significant, leading the authors to conclude that, in the absence of acute MI, coronary revascularization has minimal impact on regaining normal AV function in patients with concomitant third-degree AV block and CAD [49].The remaining published assessments of AV block in CAD patients without MI are smaller case series. Omeroglu et al., for example, reported a series of 8 patients who presented with new-onset complete AV block and severe CAD requiring coronary artery bypass grafting. Revascularization was performed on the same admission, but none of the patients had resolution of complete AV block in a follow-up of  days [50]. Narin et al. reported two cases of complete heart block in patients with unstable angina that required CABG. When AV block in one of the patients remained on postoperative day 15, he received a permanent pacemaker. The other patient, however, reverted to 1 : 1 AV conduction immediately after surgical revascularization, and the absence of significant AV block remained at a follow-up of 27.7 months [51]. Such an outcome, we believe, is likely analogous to the fortuitous clinical course experienced by the patient we describe above.In summary, while new-onset high-grade AV block in the setting of CAD is less likely to be reversible in patients without acute MI, there are patients in whom revascularization leads to immediate and durable resolution of 1 : 1 AV conduction. Examples of this phenomenon include the case illustration above as well as anecdotal cases in the literature. This clinical course is fairly unusual and the mechanism responsible is uncertain. Possible mechanisms include vagal mediation and, more likely, ischemia. The majority of published data suggest that high-grade AV block is usually not reversible with revascularization in patients who have CAD and do not present with an acute MI. The rare case such as the one we describe above is a fortunate but currently unpredictable exception to the rule that such patients will require pacemaker implantation. Nevertheless, in light of the potential negative impacts of permanent pacemakers, it may be prudent to observe postrevascularization conduction before committing patients to device implantation.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.All authors participated in concept/design, literature review, drafting of the paper, critical revision of the paper, and final approval of the paper submitted.

Cardiac involvement may be present in 50 to 60% of the patients. This is known as Löffler endocarditis. We present a case of a 36-year-old Hispanic man with signs of heart failure. Laboratory studies showed eosinophilia (23,100/μL). Thoracic computer tomography showed bilateral pleural effusion and a large left ventricular mass. Transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricle apical obliteration and a restrictive pattern. Pulmonary angiography demonstrated a thrombus in the lingular and middle lobe. Despite treatment, the patient deceased seven days after admission. Autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Löffler endocarditis.Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare disorder with unknown global prevalence, barely reported in Hispanic population [1]. HES is traditionally defined as persistent eosinophilia with more than 1500 cells per microliter for at least six months, which remains unexplained despite a comprehensive evaluation, in association with organ dysfunctions directly attributable to eosinophilic infiltration [2, 3]. In 1936, Löffler described the first cases of HES with cardiac involvement (Löffler endocarditis) [4].Cardiac involvement is secondary to the myocardium and endocardium damage due to the eosinophils infiltration and degranulation, which release toxic proteins, thus creating tissue inflammation and later fibrosis. Löffler endocarditis is present in 50 to 60% of HES cases; this is usually characterized by endocardial thickening, atrial dilatation, a restrictive pattern in Doppler echocardiography, and ventricular obliteration by an echogenic material, suggestive of fibrosis or thrombosis frequently located in the apical region of the left and right ventricles. HES can present a slow or a rapid (acute) progression, this last one especially when the heart or central nervous system is involved. The prognosis is poor, and death is usually due to congestive heart failure, often with associated renal, hepatic, or respiratory dysfunction [5–7].In this paper, we present one of the few reported cases of Löffler endocarditis in Hispanic population in addition to a clinical, radiological, tomographic, echocardiographic, and pathological correlation with literature review of this rare entity.A 36-year-old Hispanic male admitted with persistent symptoms of congestive heart failure that began 12 days before admission and persists despite standard medical treatment. During physical examination, he presents atypical chest pain, progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitation, productive cough, and fever. Physical examination revealed normal blood pressure (110/70 mmHg), tachycardia, tachypnea, elevated jugular vein pressure, and congestive hepatomegaly, in functional class III according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA). Cardiac auscultation revealed a third heart sound as well as mitral and tricuspid holosystolic murmurs; crackles were heard in both lungs and edema was observed in both legs.Chest radiography demonstrated pulmonary congestion with bilateral pleural effusion and cardiomegaly (Figure 1). Laboratory test revealed a marked leukocytosis (23,100/μL) with hypereosinophilia (59%, 13,360/μL). Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral pleural effusion and a large left ventricular mass (Figure 2). The transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate tricuspid and mild mitral regurgitation with normal left ventricular dimensions and systolic function; left ventricular filling was reduced because of endocardial thickening together with a large homogeneous mass at the apex that occupied 50 to 65% of the left ventricular cavity (Figure 3). Echocardiographic Doppler detected restrictive-type diastolic filling an  ratio greater than 2. The echocardiography also revealed another mass in the right ventricle. A coronary angiography was performed and found no significant coronary artery disease; pulmonary angiography demonstrated a thrombus in the lingular and middle lobe.An endomyocardial biopsy was performed; however, pathologic examination of the obtained specimens revealed mainly thrombus with some necrotic tissue. Despite the biopsy results, a diagnosis of endomyocardial fibrosis secondary to HES was made, on the basis of the imaging, clinical, and laboratory findings, and other secondary causes of hypereosinophilia were ruled out. Despite the team effort and adequate treatment, patient deteriorates to NYHA class IV and died seven days after admission. Then, autopsy was done which confirms the diagnosis of Löffler endocarditis (Figure 4).Although the real epidemiology of HES is unknown, it is estimated that 90% of patients are men; the majority of the cases occur between 20 and 50 years of age, with a peak in the fourth decade of life [3]. The clinical manifestations of HES are markedly heterogeneous with a wild clinical spectrum from a completely asymptomatic to a life-threatening condition; this pathology can involve many organs and systems such as skin, lungs, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and heart; therefore the diagnosis could be a challenge [3, 4]. The major morbidity and mortality in HES patients are cardiovascular complication, which is found in 40 to 50% of the cases [3].Löffler endocarditis presents with extensive infiltration of the ventricular endocardium by eosinophils, with degranulation and arteriolar necrosis with subsequent endomyocardial fibrosis. The inflammatory changes result in thrombus formation, in this case occupying both ventricular cavities, with impairment of diastolic filling and a resultant restrictive cardiomyopathy [8, 9]. The clinical presentation was consistent with heart failure with NYHA functional class III that rapidly progressed to functional class IV, despite the treatment. HES is a potentially fatal disease, with a survival rate of less than 50% after 10-year follow-up. There are several predictors of early mortality that includes intraventricular conduction delay, duration of symptoms prior to presentation, NYHA functional classes III and IV, and the presence of an embolic event. Our patient had two of these early mortality predictors (NYHA functional class IV and pulmonary embolism) and rapid deterioration; finally he deceased [10, 11].Echocardiographic and radiological studies could be a useful tool in determining cardiac anatomy and function; however, Löffler endocarditis requires a pathological diagnosis; therefore endocardial biopsy remains the gold standard. Nevertheless, in some cases the cardiac biopsy could be a risky procedure; therefore the clinician should assess the inherent risk of this intervention in each particular clinical setting. In addition, it is indispensable to rule out Löffler endocarditis when diagnosis of pulmonary disorders associated with hypereosinophilia is considered. Additionally, it is important to discard the main differential diagnosis of HES when assessing the possibility of Löffler endocarditis, which includes hypereosinophilia secondary to hypersensitivity reactions and parasite infections [4].In this case, despite the endomyocardial biopsy result, the patient had peripheral hypereosinophilia and typical echocardiographic findings of restrictive cardiomyopathy; therefore the diagnosis of Löffler endocarditis was established and then was confirmed during autopsy. Pathological finding in Löffler endocarditis includes fibrous thickening of the endocardium, leading to apical obliteration, thrombus formation, and restrictive cardiomyopathy, which clinically manifest as heart failure, thromboembolic event, and atrial fibrillation [5–7].HES treatment primary goals are to reduce eosinophil level in peripheral blood and tissue, preventing end-organ damage and avoiding adverse thrombotic events. Heart failure in Löffler endocarditis is mainly due to diastolic rather than systolic dysfunction; therefore treatment includes intravenous diuretics to decrease cardiac preload [4]. In addition, for the treatment of symptomatic patients, such as this case, the first-line drug of choice is corticosteroids followed by cytotoxic agents such as hydroxyurea or immunomodulatory agents such as interferon-alpha. Glucocorticoid treatment resulted in clinical and biopsy-proven improvement of eosinophilic and myocardial damage as well as normalization of peripheral hypereosinophilia [12, 13]. Other recent therapeutics includes tyrosinase inhibitors and new types of monoclonal antibodies (Imatinib) [4, 14]. The patient received glucocorticoid treatment without favorable response; his heart failure continued to worsen and led to his death within one week.Löffler endocarditis is a rare entity probably underdiagnosed and underreported worldwide and, in Hispanic populations, this pathology represents a diagnosis challenge for the attending physician. Therefore, when HES is suspect, an echocardiographic study should be indicated with the intention of determining if there is a restrictive pattern, and if this pattern is present, a biopsy is indicated. When there is a high clinical suspicion of HES and image studies that support the possibility of Löffler endocarditis and early mortality predictors are present, we consider that treatment should be initiated immediately even in the absence of a definitive pathological diagnosis.Authors declare no conflict of interests.
Midventricular Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy with Apical Aneurysm: Potential for Underdiagnosis and Value of Multimodality Imaging

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.We illustrate a case of midventricle obstructive HCM and apical aneurysm diagnosed with appropriate use of multimodality imaging. A 75-year-old African American woman presented with a 3-day history of chest pain and dyspnea with elevated troponins. Her electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy, prolonged QT, and occasional ectopy. After medical therapy optimization, she underwent coronary angiography for an initial diagnosis of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Her coronaries were unremarkable for significant disease but her left ventriculogram showed hyperdynamic contractility of the midportion of the ventricle along with a large dyskinetic aneurysmal apical sac. A subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram provided poor visualization of the apical region of the ventricle but contrast enhancement identified an aneurysmal pouch distal to the midventricular obstruction. To further clarify the diagnosis, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with contrast was performed confirming the diagnosis of midventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with apical aneurysm and fibrosis consistent with apical scar on delayed enhancement. The patient was medically treated and subsequently underwent elective implantable defibrillator placement in the ensuing months for recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and was initiated on prophylactic oral anticoagulation with warfarin for thromboembolic risk reduction.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited disorder of the cardiac muscle and is well known as the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in individuals less than 35 years of age in North America. It is an autosomal dominant condition with reported prevalence of 1 in 500. HCM is caused by a genetic defect which results in the mutation of the sarcomere or its associated proteins resulting in dysfunction of the myocardium. Most HCM patients (90%) are diagnosed with asymmetric septal hypertrophy, with the less common variations being midventricular/apical (1%) and posteroseptal and isolated lateral wall hypertrophy (1%). Although only 25–35% of the patients demonstrate obstruction at rest, provocable gradients can be demonstrated in up to 75% of HCM patients [1].Pathophysiology of HCM includes left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, autonomic dysfunction, and mitral valve regurgitation [2].We present a case where initial diagnosis of apical ballooning (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) was suspected at coronary angiography, but subsequent multimodality imaging with echocardiography and magnetic resonance established the unique entity of midventricular HCM with apical aneurysm.A 75-year-old African American female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease presented with a 3-day history of atypical chest pain and dyspnea. She had a long standing history of hypertension. At presentation, she was hypertensive with blood pressure of 180/100 mm Hg. The electrocardiogram ordered showed sinus rhythm (heart rate: 85 beats/min), ST depression, and deep T wave abnormality (Figure 1). Initial troponin I level was 1.5 ng/mL, and she was diagnosed with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. She was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and beta-blockers and underwent coronary angiography. The angiogram showed nonobstructive mild coronary artery disease.Left ventriculogram was done and showed a hyperdynamic midportion of the ventricle with a large aneurysmal dyskinetic sac with stasis of contrast (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Given her acute coronary syndrome-like presentation, it was suspected that she had possible Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (apical ballooning) and was admitted for further evaluation.She underwent transthoracic echocardiogram the next day, and the noncontrast image shown in Figure 3(a) displayed moderate left ventricular hypertrophy including asymmetric septal hypertrophy but poor visualization of the apex and no definite dyskinetic cavity as shown on the left ventricular angiogram. However, to define the apex better, echocardiographic contrast was utilized and the contrast images clearly demonstrated midventricular narrowing, a hyperdynamic zone, and apical aneurysmal zone similar to coronary angiogram (Figure 3(b)). There was flow acceleration demonstrable with paradoxic Doppler flow between the mid cavity narrowing and the apical aneurysmal zone (Figure 4).Based on the constellation of findings, she was diagnosed with midventricular HCM with apical aneurysm formation. She underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast that confirmed the diagnosis and further illustrated concomitant outflow tract obstruction and significant septal hypertrophy with moderate to severe secondary mitral regurgitation (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). During her hospital course, she had multiple bouts of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. She subsequently underwent implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement and was initiated on warfarin for stroke prevention.This case represents an uncommon variant of HCM, namely, midventricular obstructive variant with apical aneurysm formation, which occurs in only 1-2% of HCM patients [1]. Although a different diagnosis was entertained initially, strengths of multimodality imaging performed appropriately in this case clinched the final diagnosis and significantly impacted patient management.The pathophysiology of apical aneurysm formation is fascinating. The midventricular variant of HCM involves hypertrophy of the midventricle, which can be exacerbated by hypertension. The hypertrophy creates 2 adjacent cavities on either side of the obstruction during systole. The proximal cavity develops a low pressure zone and the distal cavity forms a high pressure zone leading to necrosis due to chronic subendocardial ischemia. This subsequently leads to scarring, thinning, and apical aneurysm formation in the infarcted tissue [1].Apical aneurysm formation and the decrease in cardiac output are attributed to a higher risk of small vessel disease and increase the chances for sudden cardiac arrest or acute myocardial infarction from ventricular arrythmias and thrombus formation due to stasis of blood [3, 4].Of note, noncontrast echocardiography did not correctly delineate this apical aneurysmal zone well. It is well known that foreshortening of the apex is a limitation of transthoracic echocardiograms. However, the addition of contrast imaging highlighted the apical dyssynergic zone very well. Unique Doppler patterns first described in midventricular HCM by Nakamura et al. (paradoxic jet flow) were also noted in our patient with Doppler echocardiography [5]. These unique Doppler flow patterns are often the clue towards concealed apical asynergy/dyssynergy, as was seen in our case. The paradoxic jet flow is from the apex to the base and is likely related to higher diastolic pressure at the apex moving blood to the lower pressure proximal zone, and in the original description by Nakamura et al., it was observed in 20/198 patients with midventricular HCM. Interestingly, such patients were found to have higher incidence of systemic embolism, ventricular arrhythmias, and thallium perfusion defects in their study. It is possible that persistent high diastolic pressure compromises subendocardial perfusion and contributes to apical necrosis and the development of aneurysmal deformation. Importantly, as Doppler is independent of image quality, such unique Doppler patterns can alert clinicians of apical pouch/midventricular obstructive physiology.Cardiac MRI carries unique value in the workup of HCM as it helps to detect more atypical variants of HCM such as apical HCM and anterolateral wall variant HCM, which seems to be underrecognized by echocardiography due to limitations in adequately imaging these areas.Cardiac MRI is also recommended as an adjunctive test by the 2011 guidelines for evaluating the anatomy when the decision regarding septal ablation versus myectomy is not clear [2]. Mitral valve morphologic variations, anomalous location of papillary muscles, multiple papillary muscle heads, and myocardial crypts are numerous additional findings that can be better demonstrated by cardiac MRI. More recently, cardiac MRI with delayed enhancement imaging with gadolinium has been shown to have increasing prognostic value with regard to assessment of myocardial scarring, which is noted in a majority of patients with HCM. In our patient, myocardial scarring was demonstrated in the infarcted apical zone, and such areas increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Recent data suggest that the extent of scarring demonstrated on cardiac MRI greater than or equal to 15% of the total myocardium may be associated with an increased risk of cardiac events in HCM patients [6].Treatment of midventricular HCM is targeted at reducing the symptoms, such as the intraventricular gradient, and the risk of complications, such as heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Beta-blockers and calcium blockers can contribute to reduction of obstructive gradients with negative inotropic effect, decreasing outflow obstruction and restoring cardiac output [2]. Septal myectomy, through resection of a portion of the septum, can achieve a similar effect by widening the outflow tract if concomitant outflow obstruction is present but may not be applicable to the midventricular variant [1].For patients with midventricular HCM and apical aneurysm, treatment options are controversial. Relief of obstruction at the mid- and basal ventricle follows standard recommendations as in the guidelines for HCM [2, 7], but this subset of patients is at a higher risk for ventricular arrhythmias and has been identified as one of the anatomic substrates in decision-making towards a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Anticoagulants are not normally given to patients with traditional HCM unless concomitant atrial fibrillation is noted; however, the midventricular HCM with apical aneurysm variant may represent a higher risk variant due to apical stasis of the blood and high risk of thrombus formation and resulting embolization and warrant anticoagulation [2].This report outlines a clinical presentation of obstructive midventricular HCM with apical aneurysm formation as identified by multimodality imaging. Clinicians should be aware of the manifestations of this entity to avoid misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis, to use multimodality imaging appropriately to delineate the anatomic substrate, to recognize the challenges in management of these patients, and to consider prophylactic anticoagulation and implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement to decrease adverse cardiac events in this subset.Archana Sivanandam and Karthik Ananthasubramaniam report no relevant conflict of interests in the preparation of this paper.Archana Sivanandam collected the case report data and was involved in paper writing and critical revision of the paper.

Anomalous Origination of Right Coronary Artery from Left Sinus in Asymptomatic Young Male Presenting with Positive Ischemic Response on Treadmill Test
Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Gadjah Mada and Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta 55281,  IndonesiaReceived 18 September 2015; Accepted 21 December 2015Academic Editor: Aiden AbidovCopyright © 2016 Budi Yuli Setianto et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Anomalous origination of coronary artery from the opposite sinus (ACAOS) is a rare coronary artery anomaly. Right ACAOS with interarterial course is a type of ACAOS, which conveys a high risk for myocardial ischemia or sudden death. We reported a case of right ACAOS with interarterial course in otherwise healthy young male. He was asymptomatic, until an obligatory medical check-up with treadmill test showed a sign of positive ischemic response. Further work-up revealed that he had right ACAOS with interarterial course. Watchful observation was applied to him, while strenuous physical activity and competitive sport were absolutely prohibited.Anomalous origination of coronary artery from the opposite sinus (ACAOS) is an uncommon coronary anomaly. Its incidence is reported to be around 1.07% [1]. It comprises anomaly of right coronary artery originated from left sinus (right ACAOS) and its opposite or left ACAOS. The incidence of right ACAOS is between 0.12% and 0.92% [1, 2]. Both right and left ACAOS have significant clinical consequence if the ectopic artery has an interarterial course or intramural intussusception [1]. Myocardial ischemia is clinical symptoms and signs frequently associated with ACAOS with interarterial course. A constant relationship is observed between left ACAOS and sudden death or ischemia during extreme exercise [1]. Right ACAOS with an interarterial course is a type of ACAOS which poses high risk for myocardial ischemia or sudden death as well [3]. However, most ACAOS does not reveal signs and symptoms; therefore the diagnosis is often found in postmortem autopsy. We described a case of asymptomatic young male who underwent treadmill test for obligatory medical check-up and the result showed a positive ischemic response. Further investigation revealed that he suffered from right ACAOS with an interarterial course.A 28-year-old male was referred to cardiology unit of our hospital from a general practitioner due to positive ischemic response on treadmill test during his obligatory medical check-up. He underwent medical check-up as an obligation related to his career. The result of Bruce-method treadmill test was positive ischemic response, good physical fitness, and aerobic capacity of 14.37 Mets (Figure 1). During treadmill test, the patient did not complain of chest pain; however his electrocardiogram showed horizontal ST depression indicating myocardial ischemia. Anamnesis revealed no history of chest pain, dyspnea on effort, dyspnea at rest, syncope, palpitation at rest, and palpitation on activity. The patient had no family history of sudden death or similar abnormality. Physical examination was within normal limit. Laboratory examination showed normal value. Electrocardiogram at rest indicated sinus rhythm without sign of ischemia (Figure 1).A noninvasive examination was performed with echocardiography. Transthorax echocardiogram showed normal cardiac chamber dimension, normal right ventricle and left ventricle wall thickness, normal left and right ventricle systolic and diastolic function, and normal left ventricular segmental and global wall motion. Mitral valve and tricuspid valve were anatomically and functionally normal. Aortic valve examination showed three cusps with normal anatomy and function. Ostium of left coronary artery (LCA) was apparent with diameter of 5 mm, whereas ostium of right coronary artery (RCA) was absent.Coronary angiography was performed for the patient, started by cannulation into ostium of LCA with Tiger 6 F catheter via radial access. An LCAgraph by contrast agent showed normal left main (LM), normal left anterior descendent (LAD), and left circumflexus (LCx). On LCAgraph view of RAO 20 Caudal 20 and LAO 30 Cranial 15, an RCA was originated from left sinus near LM and coursed through the right aspect of heart (Figure 2). The caliber of RCA was small with normal bifurcation. Posterior descending artery was filled from LCx (left dominance).The confirmation by cardiac multi slice CT (cMSCT) scan showed that RCA originated from left sinus of Valsalva with interarterial course between ascending aorta and pulmonary artery. The caliber of RCA was small with no sign of stenosis in the RCA (Figures 3 and 4). The small RCA runs through right atrioventricular sulcus and vascularized the right part of the heart. The proximal part of RCA passed through ascending aorta and pulmonary artery.Based on the diagnostic work-up, the patient was diagnosed as right ACAOS with interarterial course. The evidence of myocardial ischemia, as depicted by positive ischemic response on treadmill test, was evident in the exercise electrocardiogram of this patient although asymptomatic. Right ACAOS with interarterial course was responsible for the ischemia sign. No other structural cardiac abnormalities were found in the patient; therefore the coronary anomaly was the most likely etiology of the ischemia sign. After in-depth consultation about the prognostic implication of this anomaly, the patient and family decided that surgical correction was not to be done then. Therefore, in this patient, conservative management was employed. Watchful observation was applied to the patient, while strenuous physical activity and competitive sport were absolutely prohibited. Beta blocker as needed was given to the patient. During eight-month follow-up after the diagnosis, the patient reported no ischemic symptom during regular activity. He never took beta blocker medication then.We report a case of 28-year-old male who suffered from right ACAOS with interarterial course and the sign of myocardial ischemia. Close observation and limitation of strenuous activity were advised. Neither medication nor surgical revascularization was applied to the patient. Eight-month follow-up of this patient was uneventful.Coronary artery anomaly is an uncommon condition with prevalence on coronary angiography between 0.61% and 5.64% [2]. The incidence of right ACAOS from coronary angiography is between 0.12% and 0.92% [1, 2]. Right ACAOS with interarterial course is a group of ACAOS with high risk for developing myocardial ischemia and sudden death [3]. Close and reliable relationship is observed between left ACAOS and the incidence of sudden death and ischemia during strenuous physical activity [1]. The clinical picture of ACAOS can be divided into two spectra: the first is sudden death in the young and after strenuous physical activity or sport and the second is atypical clinical picture [1]. Most of ACAOS patients are asymptomatic. Atypical chest discomfort is the most prevalent symptom urging patients to refer to the health facility and to perform the coronary angiography to detect ACAOS. Some patients come due to positive stress test or sign of ischemic heart disease on ECG [1]. In this case, patient was referred due to positive stress test without any ischemic symptoms previously.Clinical implication of coronary artery anomaly can be divided into ischemic and nonischemic. Ischemic implication can be fixed or episodic ischemia [1]. Right ACAOS with interarterial course is associated with episodic myocardial ischemia. Interarterial course means that ectopic coronary artery runs through two big vessels arising from ventricle, that is, aorta and pulmonary artery. Three mechanisms are proposed regarding the proneness of right ACAOS with interarterial course to develop ischemia or sudden death, that is, sharp angulation and kinking of coronary artery while running off from the opposite sinus, valve-like mechanism causing acute closure in the slit-like coronary artery ostium, and compression of narrowed segment of coronary artery by aorta or pulmonary artery particularly during strenuous activity [4]. Hard activity causes dilatation of aortic root and pulmonary trunk which compresses slit-like ostium or particular segment of ectopic coronary artery. This occurs especially in individuals with sufficient aortic distensibility, such as in young people or sportsmen [1]. In our case, the patient was still young and without any complaints during daily activity and regular excercise. Ischemic sign appeared in the treadmill test marked by down-slopping and horizontal ST-depression in stage 4 Bruce-method treadmill test. We speculated that compression of RCA by big vessels was responsible for the ischemic sign.However, the unusual thing about this case is the fact that the RCA was not a dominant vessel because, based on angiogram and cMSCT, the PDA aroused from LCx. In most cases reported with ischemic symptoms associated with right ACAOS, the RCA is a dominant vessel; therefore obstruction of this vessel produces significant myocardial ischemia. Echocardiogram of the patient showed no other signs of structural cardiac abnormality; therefore the most likely source of ischemia was intramural course of the RCA anomaly. The left dominance nature of the patient prevented, so far, fatal ischemia. Furthermore, the caliber of anomalous RCA, which was small, may also account for the significant ischemic ECG changes developed during excercise test.Treatment modalities for right ACAOS with signs and symptoms of ischemia are watchful observation and drugs and coronary angioplasty with stent and corrective surgery [5]. The goal of right ACAOS treatment is to prevent sudden death and improve quality of life [3]. In this patient, after being given several alternatives treatment modalities, watchful observation was selected by the patient and his family. Restriction of strenuous activity and competitive sport was encouraged since these may cause ischemic myocardial or sudden death. Maron and Zipes (2005) stated that right ACAOS patients without intervention should not involve in competitive sport and hard physical activity [6]. The report of close observation and medication with beta blocker within 2 and 5 years in ACAOS results in zero sudden death [7]. The ACC/AHA guideline in 2008 stated that conservative approach is reasonable in right ACAOS without evidence of ischemia [8]. However, since in this patient the evidence of ischemia was present, surgical coronary revascularization should be performed (level of evidence B) [8].In conclusion, this is a case report of rare coronary artery anomaly, right ACAOS with interarterial course, with evidence of ischemic sign, that is, positive ischemic response in treadmill test, in otherwise asymptomatic young male. Wacthful observation and strenuous activity restriction were applied in this case.There is no conflict of interests.
Left Atrial Myxoma Hypervascularized from the Right Coronary Artery: An Interesting Cath Lab Finding
Department of Interventional Cardiology, Heart Institute (InCor), University of São Paulo, Avenida Dr. Enéas de Carvalho Aguiar 44, 05403-900 São Paulo, SP,  BrazilReceived 7 October 2015; Accepted 14 December 2015Academic Editor: Ertuğurul ErcanCopyright © 2016 Marcos Danillo Peixoto Oliveira et al.

They rarely remain asymptomatic, especially if large. The imaging of a myxoma by contrast dye during coronary angiography is an infrequent sign, which clarifies the vascular supply of the tumor. We report herein an interesting and rare case of a left atrial myxoma hypervascularized from the right coronary artery.Myxomas are benign and the most common cardiac tumors. They are predominantly located in the left atrium. The clinical presentation varies according to their localization and size. The imaging of such a tumor by contrast media during coronary angiography is a rare finding, which displays the vascular supply of the tumor [1, 2]. We report herein the case of a 39-year-old woman presenting with exertional chest pain due to a left atrial myxoma hypervascularized from the right coronary artery (RCA).A 39-year-old woman, active, presented with a recent four-month history of exertional chest pain. There were no previous episodes of myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary artery disease or personal or familiar histories of sudden cardiac death.General physical evaluation showed no significant findings. The chest radiography, the resting electrocardiogram, and blood tests showed no relevant alterations. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed a 27 × 38 mm sessile echodense mass attached to the left side of the interatrial septum with mixed hyperechogenic images suggesting a necrotic myxomatous tumor. Before the proposed corrective surgery, a coronary angiography was performed in order to rule out subclinic coronary artery disease. There were no lesions at all. During the selective right coronarography, a large amount of contrast media enhanced the tumoral mass (Figure 1 and video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4865439). Following the pulmonary angiography, during the late left atrial filling by the dye contrast, the negative image corresponding to the tumoral mass presence was clearly noted (Figure 2 and video 2). During the surgical procedure, the communicating branches of the RCA were detected and ligated. The tumoral mass showed a regular and smooth surface. Its histopathologic examination showed myxoid degeneration, without calcification, with the typical clustered collections of the myxoma cells and intense neovascular structures. The patient was discharged home after three days of the surgery, which was completed uneventfully. She coursed, however, with postpericardiotomy syndrome, which was managed appropriately. At the time of this report, two years after the surgical procedure, the patient is asymptomatic, without new adverse events.Myxomas are the most frequent benign tumors of the heart. Approximately 85% of them are located in the left atrium [3]. Their clinical manifestations vary according to their anatomic position and size. There are mainly 3 types of presentations: constitutional, embolic, and obstructive. Constitutional symptoms include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Embolic manifestations include stroke, myocardial infarction, and visceral infarctions. Obstructive manifestations are usually mistaken as mitral or tricuspid valvar stenosis [2].Beyond ruling out coronary lesions as preoperative assessment, coronary angiography can be useful in diagnosing and evaluating the vascularity of atrial myxomas [1]. In the majority of cases the source of vascularization is the left circumflex artery [4]. Like in our case, only few patients with left atrial myxoma supplied from the RCA have been reported [1, 2, 4].Angiographic visualization of the feeding vessels has several clinical and therapeutic implications. The detection of these vessels can influence the surgical strategy in cases with evidence of blood shunting, due to either spurting from the myxoma surface or fistula formation. This can result in a steal phenomenon that will lead many surgeons to ligate these feeding vessels during the surgical procedure [4, 5].Coronary angiography can be valuable in differentiating cardiac myxoma from thrombi, which have different therapeutic approaches (surgery and anticoagulation, resp.). The presence of neovascularization favors the diagnosis of a cardiac myxoma rather than thrombus, which is most often nonvascularized [4].Surgical excision is the definitive treatment and should not be delayed especially with polypoid types because of the high incidence of embolization. Adequate excision of the entire mass prevents recurrence. Regular follow-up by noninvasive methods is mandatory for early detection of tumoral recurrence. The mid-term survival is similar to that of the age- and sex-matched population [4].The authors have no conflict of interests.

It could be isolated or associated with other extracardiac and cardiac abnormalities, including coronary artery anomalies. Despite the continuous improvement of imaging resolution quality, this cardiomyopathy still remains frequently misdiagnosed, especially if associated with other heart diseases. We report a case of LVNC association with both malposition of the great arteries and a very original coronary artery pattern.Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a myocardial disorder, which is thought to occur due to the arrest of normal embryogenesis of the left ventricle (LV), leading to distinct morphological characteristics in the ventricular chamber [1]. The affected segments had a two-layer structure: a compact epicardial layer and an endocardial layer consisting of a prominent trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular spaces [2]; these features are found predominantly in the apical and the mid ventricular segments of the LV. It is classified in isolated NC and in ventricular NC associated with other extracardiac and cardiac abnormalities, including coronary artery anomalies [3]. The prevalence varies considerably among different series and is still unknown; several limitations for this assessment are the different diagnostic criteria, the heterogeneous populations, and the retrospective design of most studies [4]. Because of continuous improvement of imaging resolution quality, this cardiomyopathy is increasingly diagnosed, even if it remains frequently misdiagnosed especially in the cases of LVNC associated with other heart defects [5]. Clinical signs are variable, ranging from lack of symptoms to heart failure and thromboembolic events, arrhythmias till sudden cardiac death [6], also if the pathophysiologic mechanisms of these severe manifestations in LVNC are partially unclear.We present herein a case of LVNC association with both malposition of the great arteries and a very original coronary pattern. This report has been approved by the Institutional Review Board, with informed consent given by the patient.A 30-year-old male, smoker, without family history for congenital or acquired cardiovascular diseases, was referred to our department because of chest/epigastric pain and syncope due to ventricular fibrillation after cocaine overdose. After the usual resuscitation maneuvers, including 3 early direct current shocks, orotracheal intubation, and pharmacological support, his clinical conditions were stabilized. The first echocardiographic evaluation highlighted hypokinesia of the inferior LV wall, with mild systolic dysfunction and mild-to-moderate mitral valve regurgitation. During hospitalization he progressively developed lesion, ischemia, and then necrosis waves in diaphragmatic leads at the electrocardiogram (ECG); moreover the toxicological test results confirmed the recent cocaine abuse, while laboratory ones showed increased troponin I (peak 23.9 ng/mL) and N-Terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (peak 2356 pg/mL) levels.Coronary angiography showed a short main stem, originating from the right sinus of Valsalva, splitted into four branches, from right to left: an artery providing the right ventricle (RV) free wall (RCA), a dual left anterior descending (LAD) artery (type I variant of Spindola-Franco [7]), and finally a branch (Dx) supplying the anterolateral LV wall (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The lone circumflex artery (Cx) arose from the ascending aorta (Ao), just above the noncoronary posterior sinus, giving off branches to the inferolateral LV segments and the posterior interventricular septum (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). No atherosclerotic disease was detected. Computed tomography (CT) (160-slice, Aquilion Premium, Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan) angiography (Figure 2) confirmed the coronary anomaly excluding malignant, that is, interarterial, course but emphasized, after echocardiographic suspicion, a malposition of the great arteries, being aortic root leftward and anterior to a rightward and posterior pulmonary artery (PA). It also revealed ill-defined LV papillary muscles as well as the prominent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses in communication with the LV cavity, typical of LVNC. For this reason, cardiac magnetic resonance (MRI) (1.5 Tesla, Philips Achieva; Philips Medical System, Best, Netherlands) completed the multimodal imaging assessment (Figure 3), demonstrating that the diagnostic criteria for LVNC [8, 9] were completely fulfilled. At first glance, the association of L-malposed Ao and LV hypertrabeculation led us to think about a borderline case of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries; nevertheless the normal RV morphology with a three-leaflet atrioventricular valve ruled out this diagnosis on behalf of the LVNC one, in a context of atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial concordance.Because of frequent but not repetitive ventricular extra beats at the last in-hospital Holter dynamic ECG monitoring, he was discharged soon after loop recorder implantation. This device has never stored relevant arrhythmic events after 2-year follow-up.The embryonic myocardium is composed of a loose meshwork of interwoven fibers separated by deep recesses, which communicate with the LV cavity, allowing an increase in the myocardial surface area and the exchange diffusion from the cavity. From the 5th–8th week of embryogenesis, LV trabecular compaction occurs simultaneously with the invasion of the myocardium by the developing coronary vasculature coming from the epicardium: at the same time in fact the coronary circulation develops and intertrabecular recesses are transformed in capillaries [10]. The trabecular layer of the developing ventricular walls is known to compact from base to apex, from epicardium to endocardium, and from the septal to the lateral wall [1]. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms for lack of such compaction remain largely unsolved. The atrioventricular valves, papillary muscles, and chordae tendineae all form from portions of the ventricular walls as well. At the same embryonic period, the superior part of the interventricular septum develops from the aorticopulmonary septum, which is a spiral-shaped mass that also subdivides the truncus arteriosus into the PA and the ascending Ao: as a result of such spiral orientation of the septum, the Ao and PA twist around each other.LVNC coexists with another cardiac anomaly approximately in 20% of cases [11]; sometimes it may be caused by an excessively high pressure exposure of the LV during intrauterine development. The American Heart Association statement on cardiomyopathies already classified LVNC within the genetic cardiomyopathies [12]: a mutation in the α-dystrobrevin gene was identified subsequently in patients with LVNC and associated with congenital heart diseases [13]. The clinical relevance of regional NC in the context of another cardiac malformation is still uncertain. About our patient, it is a suggestive hypothesis that such a complex anomaly originated just between the 5th and the 8th week of intrauterine life, when both myocardial compaction and coronary circulation development [10] as well as great arteries translocation occurred.Diagnostic sensitivity has been enhanced by the introduction of specific morphologic criteria by high resolution echocardiography, CT angiography, and cardiac MRI. Echocardiography could pose inherent problems in assessing the LV apex [14] and lateral wall [15], known to be the most common NC areas. Conversely, the latter modalities may detect in more detail the degree of hypertrabeculation and the ratio between the trabecular and compact layers, as well as NC extension. Particularly cardiac MRI is accurate when diagnosing LVNC: a NC/C ratio of >2.3 in diastole distinguishes pathological NC, with values for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictions of 86%, 99%, and 75% and 99%, respectively [8]. Using MRI, Jacquier et al. [9] proposed a NC mass ≥20% of the total LV mass, as a further diagnostic criterion for the disease. In our case setting, the integrative nature of cardiac CT suggests an advantage of this imaging test over the others: it enabled the simultaneous noninvasive evaluation of the complex intracardiac pathology and ventricular function as well as the malposition of the great arteries and the coronary artery morphology.The coincidence of LVNC, malposition of the great arteries, and such a complex coronary anomaly has never been described before. As this case illustrates, accurate diagnosis of a grown-up congenital heart disease could be very tricky, so much so that the role of multimodal imaging assessment is fundamental.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
An Unusual Case of Biatrial Myxoma in a Young Female

Reports of biatrial myxoma are rarer, with cases of single tumor reaching both atria being more common. Here, we present an unusual case of two independently growing atrial myxoma in a 29-year-old female. We emphasize that early recognition of symptoms, confirmation of diagnosis by transesophageal echocardiography, and prompt surgical excision remain vital in the management of such patients. The patient in the present case was managed successfully with no evidences of recurrence at the last follow-up. Myxoma is a rare type of intracardiac tumor with an incidence of 0.0017% among the general population [1]. The left atrium is the most common site of origin of cardiac myxoma (75–80%), followed by right atrium (10–20%). Multiple myxoma represent 5% of all cardiac myxoma, of which half (2.5%) are of bilateral origin [1, 2]. According to the available literature, only a few cases of biatrial myxoma have been reported so far, and they generally describe a single tumor reaching both atria [3]. Herein, we present a very rare case of two independently growing atrial myxoma in a young female.A 29-year-old female presented to our institute with class III dyspnea and a history of cough for the past 1 year. She denied any past history of cardiac illness. Cardiac auscultation revealed a middiastolic murmur across mitral valve, followed by a tumor plop. Patient’s electrocardiogram (Figure 1) showed normal sinus rhythm; right axis deviation; and T-wave inversion in leads III and V1–4. Her pulse rate was 110 beats/min. Subsequently, transthoracic echocardiography in the emergency room revealed left atrium enlargement with an evidence of left atrial mass prolapsing through the mitral valve during diastole. The enlarged left atrial mass was probably attached to the interatrial septum. In addition, there were signs of mild eccentric mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Left ventricle was of normal size with intact ventricular septum. The patient was further analyzed by transesophageal echocardiography. It revealed large left atrial mass attached to the interatrial septum (size: 6.6 × 3.1 cm; Figure 2(a)), with mobility into and out of the left ventricular inflow. Of significance, another mass was also evident in the right atrium (size: 1 × 1 cm; Figure 2(b)). Mitral valve appeared structurally normal. Notably, the right atrial mass was a separate entity and was not attached to interatrial septum. Immediate operation was indicated and the patient was scheduled for the surgical excision of these masses with cardiopulmonary bypass through right atrial approach. Both atrial masses were removed successfully along with the interatrial septum. Further, the interatrial septum was replaced with a pericardial patch. Upon histopathological examination, atrial masses were diagnosed as cardiac myxomas based on their suggestive features. The left atrial myxoma measured 6.5 × 5 × 3 cm, while right atrial myxoma measured 1.2 × 0.8 × 0.2 cm (Figure 3). According to our examinations and laboratory evaluation, hemorrhage was established as the most probable cause for the formation of cystic lesions seen in the masses. Simultaneous screening of patient’s family members revealed neither a family history nor features suggestive of cardiac myxoma.Transthoracic echocardiogram performed at the 6-month follow-up in our patient revealed normal cardiac chambers, improved left ventricular function, and no evidence of residual myxoma or myxoma recurrence. The patient was kept on a yearly follow-up and she has remained symptom-free for about 1.5 years after the procedure.Myxoma is the most prevalent primary tumor of the heart. Despite being benign, it may lead to embolic events or even sudden death. Early recognition, diagnosis, and prompt treatment remain vital to prevent life-threatening events in such patients [2].In general, patients with cardiac myxoma present with symptoms of hemodynamic obstruction, embolization, or constitutional changes. Transesophageal echocardiography is widely accepted as the ideal diagnostic tool for cardiac myxoma. It confirms the location and extension of the tumor as well as the site of attachment of the tumor. Once the diagnosis is established, immediate surgical treatment is indicated in all patients to avoid further tumor embolism and valve obstruction. Prognosis is excellent after surgical excision. After surgery, regular follow-up with serial echocardiography is also very important to detect recurrence [1, 2].The present case is rare and particularly interesting because there were two different tumors, coexisting in each atrium. Initially, the diagnosis was not clearly established on transthoracic echocardiographic examination and the second tumor in the right atrium was missed. On the other hand, transesophageal echocardiography was effective at detecting both atrial tumors and was particularly helpful in identifying the site of tumor attachment and characteristics of the mass. Therefore, we recommend the use of transesophageal echocardiography as an ideal noninvasive diagnostic modality in cases of cardiac myxoma. It is estimated that the average growth rate of left atrial myxoma ranges from 1.8 to 5.7 cm/year [4]. Accordingly, the patient in the present case seems to have cardiac myxoma for more than one year as the dimension of left atrial mass in our case was 6.6 × 3.1 cm. This was reflected in patients’ symptoms, that is, complaints of class III dyspnea for 1 year at the time of presentation. Other important features in our case include presentation of biatrial myxoma at relatively young age and absence of family history of myxoma. Available literature indicates that most of the cardiac myxomas are found in middle-age females and a small percentage of primary cardiac tumors may be familial [1].Although prompt excision with high-risk cardiopulmonary bypass is the only acceptable mode of treatment [1], we believe that cardiac myxomas can be excised successfully with a low rate of mortality and morbidity. The patient in the present case was successfully operated on and is not having any recurrence to date.This work was performed at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), Ponekkara, Kochi, Kerala, India.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.
